The Minoan Dynasty was established on the island. In the following 500 years, clan-based city-states emerged and gradually influenced the surrounding areas. Around 1600 BC, which is equivalent to the time when the Shang Dynasty was established in China, the Minoan Dynasty in Crete flourished and its influence spread throughout the Aegean Sea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the eyes of the ancient Greeks, Crete was the place where Zeus, the \"Lord of All Gods\", lived before he entered Mount Olympus. He deceived Princess Io of Europa and gave birth to the first family members of the ruler of Crete on the island of Crete. The myth of the Greek hero Theseus killing the half-man, half-bull monster in the labyrinth took place on this island.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At the same time as the development of Cretan civilization, nomadic tribes from the Danube River basin migrated to the Peloponnese Plain and surrounding mountains in the Balkan Peninsula. They claimed to be descendants of the god Heron, so they were collectively called \"Greeks\". Around 1450 BC, the Mycenae they founded defeated the Knossos Palace on Crete Island. The Mycenaean civilization replaced the Cretan civilization and became the new overlord of the Aegean Sea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Around 1193 BC, Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, joined forces with the kings of other Greek city-states to declare war on Troy, the overlord of Asia Minor. This is the Trojan War known to the world. The blind poet Homer compiled a myth about it, attributing the spark of the first Eurasian war of interests recorded in the epic to a super beauty named Helen.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The war lasted for ten years, Troy fell and Mycenae won, but the long war consumed the strength of the Mycenaean city-states, and they were soon gradually conquered by the Dorians who later entered the Balkan Peninsula, and a 400-year dark age entered Greek history.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      During this period, the Dorians established a number of city-states, the most famous of which was Sparta.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After the Dark Ages, Greece entered the Archaic Age, where the economy and culture developed greatly. Due to the reforms of the Athenian politician Solon and the Spartan politician Lycurgus in their respective city-states, Athens and Sparta quickly became the two pearls of the Balkan Peninsula, and also the typical representatives of democracy and oligarchy in Greek city-states.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But the most powerful Greek city-state at that time was not these two, but Lydia from Asia Minor, which was said to be founded by the descendants of Hercules. It was called the \"Golden Kingdom\" for its abundant gold, but it attracted the covetousness of the great Middle Eastern empire Persia. It quickly destroyed Lydia and continued to attack westward, and the Greek city-states in Asia Minor surrendered. Then, the Persian Empire cast its greedy eyes on the Greek mainland. The proud Athens and Spartans refused Persia's persuasion to surrender, so the First Greco-Persian War broke out, and the Athenians defeated the Persian army in the Battle of Marathon.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But this was just a tentative military action by Persia, and the failure did not have much impact on the Persian Empire. Ten years later, the Persian Empire launched another attack on Greece, mobilizing more than 1,200 warships and more than 200,000 combat troops, an unprecedentedly large scale, in an attempt to destroy Greece in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, at Thermopylae, the Spartan coalition of only 7,000 people hit the Persian king head-on, and the Persians left more than 20,000 bodies here. Finally, with the help of Greek traitors, they used a small path to go around the back of Thermopylae, and attacked from both sides, and finally opened up the road to the south.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then in the Battle of Salamis, the clever and brave Athenian navy defeated the stronger Persian navy and buried the entire Persian fleet. From then on, the Persian navy was unable to recover and handed over control of the Aegean Sea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Finally, a decisive battle was fought between 100,000 Persian troops and 60,000 Greek troops at Plataea. Due to an accidental event (the death of the Persian commander), Greece reversed the entire situation and won the Second Persian War.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then, the Greeks began to fight back, cleared the Persian occupation forces in the Greek peninsula, and controlled various strategic locations from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea. Among them, Athens' powerful navy dominated the entire war, while the conservative Spartans retreated to their homeland and rarely participated in external affairs, which made Athens the de facto leader of Greece. In addition, Athens had an excellent politician, Pericles, who was elected as the chief general of Athens for many years. He was not only good at reconciling the conflicts among various forces in the city, but also formulated a series of effective development plans. Under his leadership, Athens developed rapidly in various aspects such as economy, culture, and military. As Pericles boasted, \"Athens has become the school of all Greece.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The prosperity of Athens naturally threatened the position of the old overlord Sparta. At that time, there were two alliances in Greece. One was the Delian League, which was led by Athens. Its influence spread throughout the coastal city-states and islands of the Aegean Sea and was mainly based on the navy. The other was the Peloponnesian League, which was led by Sparta and mainly consisted of city-states in the Peloponnese Peninsula and the central region of Greece. Its army was characterized by spearmen.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The opposition between the Land Alliance and the Sea Alliance became increasingly apparent, and conflict was inevitable. Finally, in 460 BC, one city-state withdrew from the Peloponnesian League and joined Athens, triggering the First Peloponnesian War. The war lasted until 446 BC, when the two sides ended in a tie and signed a peace treaty. By 430 BC, the war broke out again. On land, the Spartans attacked, and Athens relied on the walls built before the war to defend. At sea, the Athenians used their navy to harass the Spartans' rear, and the two sides fought each other, and the war continued.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the second year of the war, a plague broke out in Athens, killing about a quarter of the people, including Pericles. This was a huge blow to the Athenians.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After the war lasted for ten years, the two sides signed a peace treaty again. Soon after the peace treaty was signed, the two sides fought again because of Argos (a city-state on the Peloponnese Peninsula that sided with Athens because of its opposition to Sparta), and the Athenians were defeated.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In 418 BC, the twelfth year of the war, the young Athenian general Alcibiades launched a dangerous plan against the Athenians: an expedition to Sicily.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The city-states of Sicily, mainly Syracuse, were the overseas grain and grass bases of Sparta and even the entire Peloponnese. Occupying Sicily was equivalent to cutting off the rear grain supply of the Spartan allies. Moreover, although the peace treaty was signed at that time, the Spartan coalition was unwilling to return the occupied land outside Athens, and the food supply of the Athenians was relatively tight. Conquering Sicily was a matter of killing two birds with one stone, and the Citizens' Assembly passed this resolution.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So, a force of 27,000 people, including 134 triremes, 130 transport ships, 5,100 heavy infantry, 1,300 archers, and 30 horses, led by generals Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus, marched towards Sicily.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After landing, Lamachus proposed to attack Syracuse directly, but was opposed by Alcibiades, who advocated political means to encourage other Sicilian countries to oppose Syracuse. He got the support of Nicias, but no Sicilian city-state responded to the Athenian call, and all attempts failed completely.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this time, a ship came from Athens, saying that Alcibiades was involved in the destruction of statues in Athens and ordered him to return to the country for trial.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Alcibiades pretended to agree, and on his way back home, he took the opportunity to escape.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Syracuse heard about the Athenian expeditionary force's intention and decided to take the initiative to attack, but was defeated. The Athenians took the opportunity to sail their fleet into the harbor, set up camp, and began to build a long siege wall and ring wall outside Syracuse. The Syracusans sent people out of the city many times to obstruct the construction of the wall, and frequent battles broke out, all of which ended in failure. However, in one battle, Lamachus was killed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The situation in Syracuse was very critical, and they asked for help from their mother city Corinth. The Peloponnesian League quickly sent reinforcements. A force of about 2,000 heavy infantry and light infantry led by Spartan senior commander Gylippus quickly landed near Syracuse and began to raid the rear of the Athenians, forcing the Athenians to stop building the long wall that was almost completed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Niceas was extremely frustrated and sent a report to Athens. The main point of the report was that the expeditionary force was in a difficult situation and had to either retreat or reinforce.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Athens was unwilling to give up the siege, believing that it would damage their national prestige, so it decided to send a second expedition.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Gylippus decided to launch a counterattack and capture the enemy's naval base at Primyrium. He first had the Syracusan fleet provoke a battle at sea to draw the Athenian forces, and then had the army attack the empty Primyrium.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The result went as he planned, and the Athenian fleet won the victory but lost their naval base.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Sicilian coalition now controlled the entrance and exit to the Grand Harbor, and the Athenians were forced to return to their old base in the Grand Harbor.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When he heard that Athens' reinforcements would arrive soon, Gylippus decided to launch another counterattack. This time the plan was to attack both land and sea at the same time, but the land attack was a feint.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As a result, he succeeded again. Although he only sank seven Athenian ships, he completely destroyed the morale of the Athenian fleet and enabled the Syracuse to gain the initiative at sea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Life became harder for the Athenians, and this is when our story begins...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      (It has been 5 years since I last wrote a historical military novel. I feel very awkward when I pick up the pen. Now looking back at the novel I once wrote, \"Waiting to Rebuild the Old Mountains and Rivers\", the immature words make me reluctant to finish reading, but the passion surging in it makes me excited. The ups and downs I have experienced in the past five years are enough to make a simple person become sophisticated, but as long as the passion remains, I can continue my dream. Although I no longer write romance, the creation of characters and the depiction of scenes are still my specialties. I hope to enter the ancient Mediterranean world with you.)\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 2 Reinforcements": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"chapter-title\" data-v-a4858719=\"\">\n  <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    Chapter 2 Reinforcements\n   </font>\n  </font>\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"isTxt chapter-box\" data-v-7e827125=\"\" id=\"article\" style=\"font-size:20px;\">\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the center of the western Mediterranean there is a large island of Sicily, which is shaped like a triangle. Its northeast corner is close to the Apennine Peninsula, its southwest corner overlooks Carthage, and its southeast corner is located at the boundary between deep and shallow seas. There is a city-state called Syracuse nearby.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      On this day, the sea water was crystal blue, like a huge piece of jade without a trace of impurities. The waves beat rhythmically against the rocks, as if singing a soothing ballad. Countless seabirds circled and soared in the clear sky, and their loud cries seemed to echo the ancient tune of the Mediterranean.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the past, Latmans would breathe the moist air full of seawater and happily guide the merchant ships entering the harbor. At that time, his family had several acres of fertile fields, and his wife was good at managing the household, so the harvest was good. As a lighthouse keeper, he could also receive a monthly salary of two drachmas from the council.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But since the Athenian army attacked Syracuse, his life changed completely. He had to lead his family to hide in the city, leaving the fields and houses to the Athenians to ravage. Every day, he lined up in a long line to go to the square to get relief food, and slept in crowded and dirty alleys at night. His eldest son was stabbed to death by the spear of the Athenian heavy infantry in the first battle. His second son fell from the top of the wall in the assault battle to destroy the long wall built by the Athenians to besiege Syracuse and became a cripple. ... Latomans' wife couldn't face this reality and went crazy.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Whenever he thought of this, Latomans would clench his fists, tears would well up in his eyes, and he wished he could put on a bronze breastplate, pick up a spear, and fight these evil Athenians to the death. Unfortunately, he was already old.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Fortunately, the situation is starting to improve. Under the pressure of the Athenian army, many city-states in Sicily felt threatened. They united and sent reinforcements to Syracuse. Corinth, the mother state of Syracuse, and Sparta, the overlord of the Peloponnese, also sent a small number of troops and ships, as well as officers with rich combat experience... After nearly a year of fighting, the coalition forces captured Primmilion and surrounded the Athenian fleet in the harbor. Just yesterday, another naval battle was launched, and the Athenian fleet was defeated by strategy, thus breaking the myth of the invincibility of the Athenian navy.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We will launch a second attack soon!\" Latomans thought anxiously. He looked to the south. From this position, he could only vaguely see the Athenian camp, but in his mind he imagined the Athenian sailors repairing the warships with their heads down. He even thought of buying a few Athenian prisoners after the war was won and beating them up every day to relieve his hatred.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Suddenly, several loud bird calls caught his attention. The seabirds that were foraging to the north of the lighthouse flew high in the sky in panic. A sail appeared on the calm sea. Dozens of triremes soon came into Rathmans' sight.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Athenian reinforcements!\" Latomans' heart suddenly tightened.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Oh, I saw Syracuse!\" Hilo shouted excitedly on the troop transport.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The other soldiers on the same ship were equally excited. Most of them were veterans who had fought in the Aegean Sea for a long time, and the farthest they had fought was around the southern tip of the Peloponnese Peninsula to attack Sparta. However, this was the first time they had crossed the Greek mainland and attacked the city-states in the Greater Greece region.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Everyone rushed to the shore side of the boat, pointing at the towering city walls on the steep coast. The boat began to shake due to uneven force.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"You brainless idiot, get back to where you were!\" Along with cursing, a sturdy middle-aged man swung a stick and hit the soldiers who were gathered together.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      These veterans were obviously very familiar with the man. They ignored his anger and returned to their original positions slowly. From time to time, someone would joke, \"Nurnusis, why are you so angry? You must have been holding back for too long at sea and are not satisfied with your sexual desires.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nurnusis frowned at the laughter. He stood at the bow, like a towering mountain, with an imposing manner: \"I am the boss on this ship. If anyone doesn't follow the rules, I will throw him into the sea to avoid getting everyone involved.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      There was silence on the boat.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nurnusius knew that these soldiers were extremely dissatisfied, but he didn't care. The conflict between the Athenian heavy infantry and the Athenian sailors has a long history. The most powerful military force in Greece is the heavy infantry, which was confirmed in the Persian War. Most of the heavy infantry were wealthy citizens who owned land in the city-state, while the sailors were poor people without land, and the status of the two was very different. However, the situation in Athens was different, because Athens' prosperity came from the strength of the Athenian navy, and the status of Athenian sailors was greatly improved. This disparity in economic status and the difference in political and military importance made the two armies always have some minor frictions when they were together.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle Noor, have you been to Syracuse before?\" a voice sounded at this time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nurnousis looked in the direction of the sound and saw that it was Hero. Hero was different from others, as his family was a famous wealthy businessman in Athens. Normally, Nurnousis relied on helping Hat to transport goods and earn money to support himself and his dozens of brothers.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As the saying goes, eating someone else's food will make you soft-hearted. Nurnussis was somewhat helpless: \"I have been there. Syracuse is a wealthy city-state, and a large city-state. It has great influence in Sicily.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No matter how influential it is, we Athenians will destroy it like crushing an ant!\" one of the soldiers shouted.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      6,000 heavy infantry and nearly 40,000 combat troops. Athens had never concentrated such a large number of troops before, and their confidence was unprecedentedly high.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Why destroy them? We want to rob them all!\" Someone else shouted, and everyone laughed knowingly.

He went to the toilet in a daze and was about to return to his bedroom. The light coming from the next room made him stop.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Xiaoxing, your dad and I are going out for a few days to do some big business. Your brother is in poor health and has gotten worse recently. He loves playing computer games and sits there all day. You must help mom look after him at home and make sure he goes to bed on time!\" Liu Xing remembered his mother's repeated warnings before she left, and he walked to the door hesitantly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Liu Xing has always been afraid of his brother. At first, it was because of his brother Liu Hai's appearance. Liu Hai was born with transposition of the great arteries (a complex congenital heart disease). Although he had a timely operation to save his life, he was skinny since childhood, his whole body was bruised (due to congestion caused by poor heart pumping function). Due to poor development, he looked strange, and in dim light, he looked like a ghost. So Liu Xing never dared to face his brother. Even when talking, he looked around and didn't look at his face.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Later, his parents' farm grew bigger and bigger, and they hired a lot of people. Liu Hai volunteered to help manage it. After half a year, the farm was in good order and the efficiency doubled. The staff was in awe of the boy in the wheelchair, not because of his appearance, but because he was clear about rewards and punishments and strict management. Liu Xing had seen him scolding people, and his tone was so harsh and his words were so harsh that even Liu Xing was terrified when he heard it from the side.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So when Liu Xing stood in front of the door and knocked carefully, he was mentally prepared to be scolded, but there was no response from inside the house.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brother!

That scary face was unusually peaceful at this moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After nineteen years of suffering from illness, he finally found relief.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      On the desk was a book soaked in blood, with the words \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" written on the cover...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      ………………………………………………\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito was a slave.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He was once the chief of a small tribe in Thrace. Later, he was defeated in a war with the Macedonians, his village was attacked, and he and his family became slaves. They were bought by Hero's father in the Athenian slave market.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment he was very worried, for his master Hero lay in front of him with a deep wound on his right chest. He had been unconscious in the wounded camp for three days, and the doctor said that he had no chance of surviving. But Cecitus was unwilling to believe this fact, and he stayed by Hero's side, constantly praying to Asclepius.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Because Hero was the only son, he had no blood relatives and did not make a will. Once he died, according to Athenian law, his property would be confiscated. Then the stable life of Sesito and his children would no longer exist. They would become slaves of the state and either face being bought again or doing extremely heavy labor, such as mining.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito was filled with fear for the future and hated himself for not being able to protect his master. He was also angry that his master was too reckless and had completely forgotten all the combat experience he had taught him. He just rushed forward without paying any attention to protection, and as a result, he was pierced through the right chest by an iron arrow.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"...water...water...\" A faint sound stopped Tosise's desperate thinking. Although he could not understand the meaning of the words uttered from Shiloh's dry lips, it did not prevent him from falling into ecstasy.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Doctor! Doctor!! My master...my master is awake!\" He turned his head and shouted loudly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Shut up! You damned slave! I told you long ago that your master would never--\" the doctor who was leaning over to check the patient's wound cursed unhappily. Soon, he opened his eyes wide in shock, and the arm of the wounded soldier who he thought was dead was slowly moving.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He rushed over, stepping on countless wounded soldiers. He seemed not to hear their screams and knelt down beside Shiloh.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The wound that had been bleeding had healed and formed a scar. The doctor touched Shiloh's right chest with trembling hands, muttering to himself.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment, Xi Luo opened his eyes and looked at everything in front of him blankly: \"Am I still alive? Where is this?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      No one could understand what he said, but no one cared at the moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"How do you feel now?!\" the doctor said to Shiloh excitedly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh stared at the doctor, the look of surprise on his face becoming more and more intense. Then he closed his eyes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Doctor, what's wrong with my master?\" Cecito asked anxiously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Damn slave, how dare you touch me with your dirty hands!\" The doctor kicked Tosise down in anger and kicked him a few more times.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito was stronger than him, but he did not dare to resist.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After a long time, Xi Luo opened his eyes again. After looking around, his eyes stopped on Cecito's face: \"Cecito?\" He said uncertainly. This time, Tosise could understand because it was in Greek.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It's me, master. It's so... great that you woke up!\" Cecito's eyes were filled with tears.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Miracle! This is a miracle! The miracle of Asclepius!\" The doctor knelt on the ground, muttering.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh's mouth curled up slightly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is not a miracle, this is a journey.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The current owner of this body is a Chinese who has the memories of Shiloh.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      His name is Liu Hai.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      ………………………………\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The tents propped up with linen could not completely block the cool breeze blowing from the sea, and the wailing of the wounded soldiers was even more miserable than during the day.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In this era of extremely backward technology, medical skills were still at the stage of religion and witchcraft medicine. When people got seriously ill, they would go to the temple to seek medical treatment or ask the witch to make spells for treatment. When ordinary doctors faced serious illnesses, apart from prescribing some peaceful and harmless herbs, the only method was bloodletting.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      On the battlefield, when soldiers were injured or sick, they could only rely on their own physical strength to resist the disease. Everything was left to fate, and there was no other way. However, Hero was shot through the chest by an arrow, which was a serious injury that could not be more serious. In the past, such patients would not last long, but he was in a coma for only two days and recovered. This made all the doctors and wounded soldiers firmly believe that he was favored by Asclepius. So this afternoon, they all surrounded him, asking him what he dreamed about in his coma, and even touched the scar on his chest with their hands, hoping to get a little \"divine spirit\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After being harassed by the wounded soldiers for a long time, Hilo, who had just woken up, still couldn't fall asleep in the dark night. Because he was Liu Hai, a Chinese with Hilo's memory. After an afternoon of indirect questioning, he was sure that he was neither dreaming nor seeing hell, but came to a strange world. Although he didn't know what brought him here, he knew that he could never go back to this parallel world after reading several books written by Mr. Hawking.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      His parents, who had always loved him deeply and had been worried about his illness, and his younger brother, whom he had always wanted to get close to and love, he will never see again in this life!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      While he was depressed, he was also grateful. He had been suffering from illness for many years and knew very well that when he was reading the History of the Peloponnesian War and preparing to answer a question from a netizen, he suddenly suffered from left heart failure and the accompanying lung failure, which had brought his life to an end... Now he has regained his life, and it is a young and energetic life. Although he is no longer a Chinese, this is enough to make him grateful. Only those who always worry that their lives will be blown out like a candle will deeply feel the preciousness of life.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This time, the God whom he had always cursed compensated him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But the thief God was simply torturing him. He had just escaped the embrace of the god of death, and now he was facing death again. By analyzing the words of the wounded in the afternoon, he could determine that he had come to the ancient Mediterranean era of Athens and Sparta. The turning point of the Peloponnesian War was the Sicily expedition, where an Athenian army of about 50,000 people attacked Syracuse and was eventually defeated and annihilated. And now he was a member of this expeditionary force.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Am I going to die again just after I came back to life?\" He clenched his fists unwillingly. The thick muscles bulging in his arms seemed to encourage him: \"No! I have to find a way to escape! I must escape!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But how to escape? In Hero's remaining memory, he was just an Athenian citizen who had just turned 18. Although his family was rich, he was too young to give a speech at the Citizens' Assembly, and he had never held any public office. In this army, he was just an ordinary heavy infantryman. In a word, he was a newcomer and had no influence. Even if he told the general every day, \"Athens will fail, we should retreat!\" No one would believe him.

He got used to the administrative faces of village cadres and town leaders who could make things happen at will; later, when the company grew bigger, he helped his parents manage personnel, and he also enjoyed a lot of flattery, treats and gifts from those employees.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Since he had guessed this possibility, and was not absolutely sure, he would not be foolish enough to go directly to the general and expose himself completely.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He tried hard to recall the historical materials he had read about the Sicilian Expedition, but unfortunately he was not a professional historian and only knew the general process.

No matter what the reason was, at least the strong man was quite respectful to him, so he said: \"I remember everything you did.

The grand war scenes and the heroic images of the gladiators left a deep impression on him. Weak people admire brave people, which is a kind of psychological compensation. From then on, he began to learn about ancient Roman history, from ancient Rome to ancient Greece, from ancient Persia to ancient Egypt. He was so obsessed that he even served as the moderator of the ancient Western military section of a military website.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      What he saw before him was real ancient Greek soldiers training, so how could he not be interested?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      There are dozens of groups of troops on this training ground which is about ten miles long. The number of people in each group ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand. However, the training content is roughly the same: almost naked warriors form a large array, with a dense square formation of heavy infantry holding round shields and spears in the center, a loose line of archers and javelin throwers in front, and a very small number of cavalry on both wings. The formation in the rear is even more messy, and these \"warriors\" have empty hands.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Since they were all naked warriors and had no weapon markings on their hands, Hiro was unable to guess their identities and finally had to ask Cecito.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito said in a deep voice: \"Master, they are just like me.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh glanced at him and suddenly realized what was going on. He recalled the historical records: These slaves brought by the heavy infantry from their homes were on the battlefield, holding wooden sticks and following the heavy infantry. Their role was to beat the fallen enemies to death and protect their masters who were injured or fell and could not get up because their armor was too heavy...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The phalanx advanced under the commander's command, moving slowly and in disorder. Soon the formation formed a curve, with the two wings in front and the center in the back. It was not until the line broke and a certain part was too prominent that the horn sounded and the formation was reorganized.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After marching for a distance, the horn blew rapidly, and the archers in front quickly retreated to the sides. The cavalry galloped on their horses, and the infantry began to charge, immediately stirring up dust all over the sky...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      While confirming what he had learned from the book, Shilo was imagining the scene when the phalanx would collide with the enemy, and his heart was filled with excitement.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sesito glanced at Shiloh, and the fanaticism in Shiloh's eyes reminded him of the \"martial arts fanatic\" master before he was injured. After recovering from his injury, Shiloh seemed like a completely different person, but he was happy to see this transformation.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I hope what he said just now about rewarding me is not just a casual remark.\" Cecito began to worry: \"What will he give me?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Just as he was daydreaming, he heard Xi Luo say, \"Let's go, it's boring.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito obediently helped him up, and he sighed again: \"I thought this kind of pre-war training must be very interesting, but I didn't expect it to be just walking back and forth. The intensity of this training is too low!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After walking a few steps, Xiluo asked: \"I remember that you, Sesito, were once the chief of a small tribe in Thrace. Do you usually do this kind of training?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sesito was stunned. His dry and numb heart was broken by Hero's words. A huge amount of people and events from the past came flooding back to him. Sesito closed his eyes in pain and said in a trembling voice for a long time: \"We Thracians don't need such training. We usually ride horses, hunt, and fight. If the enemy comes, we...will pick up long swords① to fight...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"If the people coming are Greeks, how many can you deal with?\" Shiloh asked softly with a smile.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"About three. If the Greeks didn't use that 'turtle shell', there could be more...\" Sesito, who was immersed in his life, was induced by Hero and answered truthfully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"If I fight you, who will win?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"You are very strong, I can't fight you head-on...\" Cecito said, and then he realized something was wrong. He looked up and saw a big smile on Shiloh's face. His face turned pale in an instant, and it seemed as if something was stuffed in his mouth, and he couldn't utter a word.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"This is a Thracian slave who has no scheming, is experienced in combat, is unwilling to give in, but is afraid of himself.\" Shiloh was delighted with his discovery.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Secito, you have been in my house for ten years, right?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Ten years, Master.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"You have taught me a lot in the past ten years. Although you are a slave, I always regard you as my teacher in my heart.\" Shiloh said emotionally: \"To thank you for your consistent loyalty to my family in the past ten years, I will give you a room when I go back this time so that you can live with Alesha and Kunda.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sesito was completely stunned. You know, the reason why he did not resist after being captured was because of his children. In the Athenian slave market, slaves with superb martial arts skills like him were actually quite popular, but he asked the employer to buy his children as well, which made many people shake their heads and leave, and finally came to Hero's house. Hero's house was very big. His daughter Alesha went to the textile factory, and his son Kunda went to the weapons workshop. The slaves had no freedom and could not walk around freely on weekdays. Ten years later, they didn't meet and get together very often.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Moreover, the long ten years had worn away his unyielding spirit. After being a slave for a long time, people became numb and resigned to their fate. But he did not expect that today, Shiloh would agree to let him live with his children! !\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He suddenly knelt on the ground and slammed his head heavily on the ground: \"Thank you, Master! Thank you, Master!! Thank you, Master!!!...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shilo, who had only wanted to gain Cecito's loyalty through favors, felt sad at this scene.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This evil slave society!

He picked up the big shield but almost fell down. This thing was too heavy, about 20 kilograms. In the middle was a hard wooden core, covered with a layer of bronze. On the front was a pattern: a muscular naked man was fighting with an angry giant lion.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro remembered the story of Hercules killing the Lion of Nicaea.

It seemed that everyone's attention had been completely attracted by him. \"Just when I was scared, a dark door appeared above my head, and a huge force sucked me in... In front of me was a gray road with no end in sight. I walked and walked, feeling very tired, but for some reason I just didn't want to stop and rest. Moreover, a cold wind blew from time to time. The wind blew on my body and froze me immediately.

But I couldn't help but walk towards the river. I was about to walk into the river--\" Xi Luo paused deliberately, seeing that everyone stretched their necks and held their breath, and said slowly: \"At this time, a voice suddenly came from the gray sky, like a huge thunder, 'Go back, this is not the place for you', and then a strong wind blew and swept me up... When I opened my eyes again, I found that I was back in the wounded camp.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      With thousands of years of knowledge, Shiloh was able to tell a vivid story. The military tent was silent, and everyone was still thinking about it. After a long while, someone asked, \"Shiloh, who is the god who is speaking in the sky?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh shook his head in confusion. He deliberately set up such a plot to create suspense, make the whole story more real, and avoid being suspected by being asked about details, such as what the god who saved him looked like.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I think it should be the great Zeus.

He was originally an Egyptian. He was bought into Helo's family when he was young and served Hepias, who was also a child. When he grew up, he assisted Hepias in sailing Helo's merchant ships to various ports in the Aegean Sea. Herpias appreciated his loyalty and contribution and granted him freedom.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After he became a freeman, he still depended on the Hero family and helped Hepias manage the fleet. After Hepias died, he could not become the guardian of Hero because he was not an Athenian citizen. However, because the guardian Pericles (the reason why Pericles became the guardian will be described later) was too busy with the affairs of the city-state, and the wealthy Hero family also had a lot of things to do, he had to let Sulmus help him deal with some of the affairs of the Hero family. Pericles died of illness, and the new guardian appointed by the city-state only wanted to get some benefits from the Hero family, so Sulmus became the actual person in charge of the Hero family.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh's feelings towards him are very complicated, and there is even a sense of admiration for him like a father. If you think about it, it is understandable. Shiloh's father died when he was four years old, and he was mainly taken care of by Sulmus afterwards, and Sulmus was indeed very dedicated.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But Hilo's attitude towards Timasus was completely different. When Hilo was old enough to go to school, Solmus hired a tutor for him and asked Timasus, who was two years older than Hilo, to live in Hilo's house and study with him. This was Solmus' selfishness at work. Saving tuition money was secondary. He hoped that his son could develop feelings with the young master, just like he did in the past. However, he did not expect that expectations were completely different from reality.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      For some reason, Timasus always wanted to show that he was smarter than Helo, and he was indeed better than Helo in arithmetic, poetry, and eloquence, and was often praised by the teacher. In contrast, Helo seemed more clumsy in the eyes of the teacher, so he suffered a lot. When he was old enough to receive physical training, Helo's advantage was revealed, and of course he wanted to retaliate. He either beat Timasus black and blue during sparring or laughed at him loudly when he couldn't complete the movements. As a result, the relationship between the two became more and more strained, and even when they grew up, they would sometimes quarrel when they met.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"When I was lying in the wounded camp, waiting for the death of my servant, I recalled the past countless times. Every time I thought of you, I didn't feel any resentment. Instead, I wanted to hear you call me 'Northern Bull'?\" Xi Luo stared into the void and murmured, \"Thinking carefully, neither of us has any extra brothers. We grew up together. All the quarrels actually came from the temper of children. Later, if we didn't quarrel a few times every day, the day seemed to be missing something... Maybe you also felt it, but we were both unwilling to admit it... Just when I thought I was about to die, I swore to the great Zeus that if I could live again, I would definitely apologize to you for the mistakes I made in the past, and then call you - Big Brother! -.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hero stole a glance at Timathus and saw that he was already aroused. He secretly laughed in his heart. Using modern sensational means to deceive an inexperienced ancient young man was simply an overkill.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then, Xi Luo said solemnly: \"Brother, can you accept my apology?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus already had a face full of guilt, not knowing what to say, and just mumbled, \"Shiloh... I... I...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo knew that enough was enough. He took a step forward and whispered, \"Brother, actually, when I came back to life, I saw some things.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus did not object to Hero calling him \"brother\". His attention was completely drawn: \"What is it?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Some scenes seem to be about our war, including that in a few days, the general will launch a major attack at night and will suffer a disastrous defeat.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What?!!!\" Timasus' scream attracted the attention of others.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brother, you have to keep it a secret for me! The voice in the air repeatedly warned me to keep it a secret. I only told you because you are not an outsider. Please don't hurt me.\" Xi Luo whispered nervously. He now felt more and more like a charlatan.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Is this true?\" Timasus swallowed and asked doubtfully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I don't know, but if we attack at night in a few days, it might be true!\" Shiloh reminded him vaguely.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus pondered for a while, then smiled and said, \"Whether this is true or not, let's not worry about it for now, Xiluo... Thank you, since you call me big brother, I will be a real good brother in the future.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …………………………………………\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The next day, as if to prove what he said, Timasus left his slave Herim to take care of Hero before going to practice. In fact, Herim was also Hero's slave. Solmus bought him for two reasons. First, he was a hunter and had good archery skills, and young Hero and Timasus needed an archery teacher at the time; second, he was Egyptian.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sulmus encouraged his son to join the expedition, and worried about his safety, so he asked Hero to \"borrow\" the slave. Hero didn't care about these trivial matters, and out of respect for Sulmus, he readily agreed. However, he used this opportunity to mock Timasus several times during the boat ride.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Herim was even more taciturn than Cecito. Hiro, who was good at observing people's expressions, even felt that he treated him with some reluctance. Comparing this with his previous attitude towards Timathus, Hiro realized how great the influence of Surmus was at home.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Of course, now is not the time to think about how to clean up the family; the first priority is to escape.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After another night's rest, Hiro felt that his strength had recovered a lot, so he asked Cecito to practice sparring with him outside the military tent.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although his body still retains strong somatic memory, he still needs to integrate these fighting skills into his brain and make them truly his, rather than just fighting on instinct.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      However, his plan was destroyed by countless Athenian soldiers who came over.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The news that Shiloh was favored by the gods spread like wildfire throughout the military camp in just one morning.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Soon the tent where he lived was crowded, and he was surrounded by soldiers for the whole day until a loud voice rang out: \"Who is Shiloh?

He was a little nervous. He made up a \"ghost story\" to achieve a certain purpose. Of course, he thought about what might happen after it was spread, and prepared some response plans, but he didn't expect to be summoned by Demosthenes so soon.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He thought about it over and over again, but could not figure out any reason why Demosthenes wanted to kill him, and he felt a little relieved.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The guard came out and let him in.

Wearing a helmet in private inevitably made Hero wonder in his heart. As far as he knew: Pericles, the most famous politician in ancient Athens, often liked to wear a helmet to participate in various public activities. Could it be that this has become a popular trend, or is it Demosthenes' own personality cult?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes was also looking at Hero, his blue eyes were as sharp as an eagle, seeming to be able to penetrate people's hearts, but soon a smile appeared on his face, he stretched out his arms, and stepped forward to hug Hero.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This sudden action made Hiro at a loss, and a term suddenly emerged in his mind: homosexuality.

Shiloh couldn't find any impression of him in his memory.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes took a step back, looked at him again, and said with a sigh: \"Your father and I have been comrades for many years. When he covered Pericles' retreat, I was beside him. Unfortunately, the enemy's javelin came too fast. Sigh... After so many years, God bless you, you have grown up healthy, and you are taller and stronger than your father.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes tapped Hero's chest and said kindly, \"Sit down, child.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then, he asked Shiloh about his situation in the military camp, and Shiloh answered him one by one. If it were an ordinary young man, he would have been very moved, but Shiloh was different. He had been ridiculed and looked down upon by others since he was a child. He always had a defensive mentality towards strangers and did not believe in others' love for no reason.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I heard that you were seriously injured during our attack on the Wall.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I was inexperienced and forgot to protect myself with my round shield.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"In this battle, many soldiers were seriously injured like you. We thought Syracuse would be crushed by our army, but we didn't expect that the war would last for more than a year. The enemy is getting stronger and stronger, and our situation is getting more and more difficult. We must have a big victory to change our unfavorable situation and let the warriors of Athens return home with glory!\" Demosthenes gestured and spoke passionately, but he saw that Hero looked calm, and he couldn't help but be a little surprised: Isn't it said that this young man is reckless?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"But,\" he sighed, \"due to the long-term absence from Athens, coupled with several recent defeats, the morale of the soldiers is very low, which has caused great difficulties in the implementation of the next battle plan.\" He paused deliberately, waiting for Hero to ask questions, such as \"What should we do?\", so that he could take advantage of the situation. But Hero remained motionless, pretending to listen carefully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes was a little depressed. He was elected as a general at the citizens' assembly, and of course he was good at public speaking, but he couldn't inspire the young man in front of him, and he was in control of the speech.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"But because of you, the situation will change greatly. You, Hero, are blessed by God and are seriously injured but safe and sound, so other people may also be blessed by God; if God saves you, then the gods may stand on the side of us Athenians. Everyone who has heard your story will think so, and they must firmly believe that Athens will win!\" Demosthenes looked at Hero with his eyes sharp.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this point, Hiero had understood Demosthenes' intention. He had never thought that Demosthenes had called him here not to punish him, but to take advantage of his miraculous resurrection. Although he was surprised, he still tried his best to remain calm: \"General, what do you want me to do?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Seeing Hero's straightforwardness, Demosthenes stopped talking and said, \"In the next one or two days, on the full moon night, we will launch an attack on the enemy coalition. I hope you can join me as the vanguard. It doesn't matter if you haven't recovered your strength. You don't need to fight. Just let them know that the people blessed by the gods are with them. I believe victory will belong to Athens!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hero looked at the confident general and knew that he was determined. He could not refuse. He thought about it again and again, remembering that Demosthenes was killed by the enemy after he surrendered. It would be safest for him to follow him now. After making up his mind, he said solemnly: \"As an Athenian citizen, it is my honor to contribute to Athens!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Good! Good!\" Demosthenes said \"good\" several times, patted Hero on the shoulder, and said: \"Hypias gave birth to a good son!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo suddenly had an impulse: \"General, I have some questions about the upcoming battle.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What doubts?\" Demosthenes was in a good mood at the moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We in Athens have never conducted such a large-scale night battle. This time will be a first. Only an excellent commander like the general has the courage and ability to accomplish it.\" Hero first flattered Demosthenes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes smiled and accepted it calmly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      It's not that Demosthenes was too arrogant. He was indeed the most talented land commander on the Athenian side in the Peloponnesian War, and the only Athenian general who defeated Sparta head-on in a land battle. Take this raid plan for example, Demosthenes' talent shines. Concentrating superior forces, taking the enemy by surprise, and attacking them when they are unprepared are the classic rules of Eastern and Western tactical thinking. At the end of the fifth century BC, when Western military thought had not yet been initially established, Demosthenes not only applied it in practice, but also creatively used night battles. It was just that he ignored the complexity of night battles, which led to the inevitable defeat due to accidental events. If he had been reminded of this problem, perhaps he could have avoided failure, and then he would not have to consider other escape plans and could have returned home smoothly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Thinking of this, Xi Luo carefully organized his words and said, \"But, General, with so many people fighting in the dark, and without prior training, how can you ensure that you can smoothly command the entire army and ensure that your orders can be smoothly conveyed? In the dark, it is difficult to distinguish between the enemy and us. What code words have you prepared to prevent the enemy from infiltrating our team? In case a small group of troops is defeated, what measures have you prepared to prevent them from attacking the team behind and causing chaos in the team?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes' smile froze on his face. Hilo's questions were thought-provoking. But at the same time, Hilo was not experienced enough. His words clearly revealed a meaning: \"This night raid will fail.\" This made Demosthenes feel quite uncomfortable. Looking at the slightly childish face, he said bluntly: \"Hilo, you just started military service this year, so you don't have much experience in war. What you need to do now is to keep this secret, take good care of your body, and then welcome victory with everyone in the battle.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh's expression changed. He said no more and saluted and left in a hurry.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes stood at the door, watching Hero's back being hidden by the darkness, with a thoughtful look on his face.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Remark:\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      1. Demosthenes led a force of about 1,000 men to fight against a Spartan army of more than 1,000 men in Ambretsia. He first lured the enemy deep into the territory, then used an ambush to defeat the enemy's two wings, and finally won the victory.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

He knew from the tone of Demosthenes' last words that the general was not interested in his suggestions. While scolding Demosthenes for being stubborn, he once again strengthened his determination to carry out his original plan.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In fact, at that time, most Greek generals were stubborn and insisted on their own views. Before the Battle of Salamis, after failing to convince the leaders of the Greek coalition forces to accept the proposal of a decisive battle with the Persians at sea for several days, the Athenian general Themistocles had to use a strategy to let the Persian navy blockade Salamis to force the Greeks to fight. In the subsequent Battle of Plataea, the Greek coalition forces confronted the Persian army in Plataea. The Greek coalition forces decided to retreat to a relatively advantageous position, but a Spartan general resolutely refused to retreat and spent the whole night in quarrels. On the second day, the rest of the troops retreated, but the central force of Sparta remained in place. As a result, it was surrounded by the Persian cavalry who came after hearing the news. The Greek coalition forces had to fight a decisive battle with the enemy. If the Persian general had not accidentally fallen off his horse and died, the outcome of the Greco-Persian War might have been rewritten.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The stubborn nature of Greek generals comes from their culture. The Greeks who grew up in the Greek city-state system and culture advocate freedom, love thinking, like independence, pursue personal honor, and are extremely confident individuals who will not be easily changed by the will of others.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This incident taught Shiloh a small lesson. He walked forward while thinking, and before he knew it, he had arrived at his own military tent.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus, who was waiting there anxiously, came forward and asked: \"Helo, what is the general calling you for?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo looked at him with a heavy face: \"The general is planning to launch a night raid on Syracuse in the next two days, and he asked me to participate.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Oh!\" Timasus opened his mouth wide and cried out in amazement: \"This is true! It...it came true!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh made a gesture to silence her: \"This is a military secret, you can't tell anyone.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus hesitated to speak and looked at Hero eagerly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro was very satisfied with Timasus's reaction, but his face remained calm: \"This is only half of the truth.

Of course I reminded him. Even though the gods warned me to keep it secret, I still gave him suggestions in a tactful way out of my love for Athens. But not only did he not listen, he also drove me out of his tent. If I had told him the prophecy directly, I guess he would have killed me as a spy.\" Hero vented his anger.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Then...what should I do?\" Timasus muttered to himself in confusion.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro looked at him with contempt. The more he interacted with Timasus, the more he realized that this young man was too immature. However, on the other hand, it was a good thing for Hiro.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I was wondering who has such a loud voice. It turns out it's Shiloh who's back.

Nurnusis! Shiloh's eyes lit up, he was really looking forward to Cao Cao, Cao Cao coming! In Shiloh's memory, he admired Nurnusis very much. That was because when he was a teenager, he had taken Nurnusis's cargo ship several times and witnessed his unique courage as a seaman fighting against the wind and waves.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh came forward with a smile: \"If I had known that the uncle was coming, I should have come back later.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nurnusis was stunned for a moment, then laughed: \"The little bull's injury was not in vain, he has learned to joke.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo endured the strong fishy smell from Nurnusis and gave him a strong hug. \"The harbor is so unsafe right now, but you still went out on a boat to fish for me. I really appreciate it!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It's not easy to catch these cod.

Although the Shiloh family's business was now managed by Sulmus, Shiloh was already an adult and could take over his family's business at any time. He made some emotional investment now, which would be useful in the future. Unexpectedly, Shiloh saw through his intentions at a glance and immediately promised him benefits.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      How come this child has become smarter after not seeing him for a few days?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nurnusis was in a daze, and Shiloh continued, \"Uncle, is the beach management very lax?

He didn't know that according to Athenian military law, when an army reached a certain size, it was necessary to have priests accompanying it. So when he went to see Demosthenes as agreed and saw the priests in the military tent, he was nervous because he had something to hide.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In fact, the priest was also in a difficult situation. As a clergyman, he should have questioned the authenticity of Hero's rumors, but Demosthenes's persuasion made sense. In order to pursue victory on the battlefield, other things can be put aside temporarily. When he returned to Athens, he would report the matter to the temple. After he made up his mind, he ignored Hero.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro looked at the priest, roughly guessed his intention, and sneered secretly.

Our actions frightened the Ionians. Sparta, Corinth, Syracuse... they gathered all their strength to oppose us, and we were caught in a bitter battle.

Hero, you have done a great job!\" Demosthenes exclaimed loudly with emotion. He was intoxicated by his successful directing of this play.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro said a few perfunctory words, cursing Demosthenes' ancestors in his heart. Demosthenes was simply roasting him on the fire! When the battle failed, would these excited soldiers vent their anger on him? The thought of this made him feel terrified.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The sacrifice is over, the pre-war mobilization is over, and it is time to send troops.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes had obviously made careful preparations. There were about 20,000 people in the camp who could actually fight (excluding slaves, craftsmen, sailors, and merchants). He led 20,000 people to fight, leaving only a few people to guard the camp. These 20,000 people were led by him, Eurymedon, and Menander (a senior commander). They carried five days of food, as well as all the stonemasons, carpenters, and everything needed to build a fortress if the battle was successful. Therefore, this army was quite large and swollen.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Demosthenes' vanguard crossed the Arapes River and climbed up the path to the heights of Epipolis, as the people of Syracuse called it, the tail end of the team had not yet left the camp.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh looked back: under the moonlight, countless shadowy figures were swaying on the dark hillside. The sea breeze rushed up from the bottom of the mountain, whistling, and all the sounds made by the team were covered.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes ordered the vanguard to stop and wait for the follow-up troops. He discussed the battle plan with Eurymedon, Menander and other senior commanders (according to Athenian military law, the general is the commander of the troops, followed by the senior commander, equivalent to the current regiment commander, and then the middle commander, equivalent to the battalion commander. Except for the general, the rest of the generals are decided by the Athenian Council, most of whom are members of the parliament and have rich combat experience. The number of people in their team is not fixed, it depends on the number of citizens summoned by each Demo - equivalent to the number of citizens summoned by the current villages and towns, and the number of mercenaries recruited).\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As a symbol of \"God's chosen warrior\", Hero naturally followed Demosthenes during the march. Now there was an opportunity to observe and learn ancient military, and he certainly didn't want to give it up, so he shamelessly followed to listen. Demosthenes was preoccupied with the war and didn't notice him. The guards thought the general acquiesced, so they didn't pull him away.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After listening for a while, Hilo understood Demosthenes' plan: the coalition camp was in the northwest corner of the Erigorian Plateau, the long wall outside Syracuse was in the east, and the current position of the Athenian army was in the south. Demosthenes asked Menander to lead more than 3,000 people to capture the Syracusan sentry tower not far ahead, and then quickly attack the nearest ring of the long wall. There were only about 600 Syracusans stationed there, and they were unprepared. Seizing the long wall and blocking the Syracusans in the city was the first step. After Demosthenes and Eurymedon and other large armies arrived, they formed a battle array to attack the coalition camp.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As for whether the Syracusans would go out to fight back, everyone had a relatively consistent opinion: After a year of war, the Syracusans had lost a lot of manpower. Even if they could go out to fight, their number would not be too large, and Menander could completely stop them. As for whether the Sicilian coalition army could go out to fight, everyone had different opinions. Demosthenes smiled and said, \"It would be better if Gylippus (the commander of the coalition army) did not go out to fight, so that I can deploy the troops calmly and capture his camps one by one.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After the discussion, the generals went to complete their respective tasks.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the darkness, it was impossible to use flags to issue orders, and blowing the horn would alert the enemy, so all that could be heard was shouting.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"General, I want to join their battle!\" Hiro pointed at the slowly gathering team and asked Demosthenes for a fight. He was not a warrior, but wanted to take the opportunity to escape. He finally understood that if it was so difficult to command more than 3,000 people to gather at night, how difficult would it be to command 20,000 people to fight? You know, 20,000 people lined up, with a depth of 8 rows, and the front was at least two kilometers long. How to communicate and coordinate with such a large lineup in the dark was a huge problem. Even Alexander did not dare to try it easily in the decisive battle with the Persians. Even if Demosthenes listened to what he said at the beginning, he could not think of a way to improve it for a while.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiero originally wanted to remind Demosthenes at the critical moment to change the outcome of the battle, but when he arrived on the battlefield, he found that the ideal and reality were far apart.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No, Hero, you should stay here! You will play a greater role!\" Demosthenes refused.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I heard that you are famous among the young people in Athens for your superb fighting skills and extraordinary strength, and are called the 'Second Hercules'!\" Demosthenes said praisefully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Because of the darkness, Hiro couldn't see Demosthenes' expression, but he instinctively became wary: \"We were just kids playing around.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The implication is that I am still a child, so don't assign me any important tasks.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Demosthenes completely ignored his words, his eyes sparkling, his voice deep and powerful: \"As a man, you should have great ambitions! In the next battle, you will have the opportunity to accomplish the same great feat as Achilles and be respected by the citizens of Athens!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo's heart trembled, and Demosthenes' words came clearly into his ears: \"I want you to be the vanguard of the battle!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Remark:\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Battle pioneer: In the early battles of the ancient Greeks, the bravest warriors were placed at the front of the team.

Think about it, when you stand at the front, more than 20,000 warriors will focus their attention on you. What an honor it is!

At least what Demosthenes said was credible. He would protect his own life.

The Athenians did not bring bows and arrows because the darkness would make them lose their accuracy. The coalition army also had very few archers because the Spartans despised this type of soldiers who did not dare to fight the enemy hand-to-hand. Neither side wore armor because it was inconvenient to walk in the darkness.

Shiloh was carrying more than 20 kilograms of weight on his hands, and he didn't feel any effort running from the bottom to the top. Soon, he saw the outline of his enemy: a giant who was taller and stronger than him, and roared like thunder. The giant rushed down, and Shiloh could even feel the suffocation coming towards him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this critical moment, Shilona, ​​whose nerves had become strong due to the threat of death since childhood, remained clear-headed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At the moment the two men collided, Shiloh squatted down in a bow stance and quickly raised the round shield in his right hand diagonally upwards.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Bang!!\" The huge force almost knocked Shiloh over.

The only thing he could do was to protect his upper body with his iron shield, try to turn his body sideways, and hide himself under the protection of his companions' shields. Facing the enemies at hand and the spears that kept stabbing at him, he could not retreat, but could only stab at them, knocking down one, then two. Only by constantly stabbing the enemies and persisting until his side won could he survive.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The screams of every companion or enemy near Shiloh shocked him. Out of the desire to survive, he roared hysterically and waved his spear like crazy. Countless people did the same thing as him. At this moment, all other thoughts were thrown out of their minds. The warriors of both sides fought on this battlefield in the dark night just for survival.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although the Athenians fought hard, the center of the army was slowly retreating. On the one hand, Gylippus compressed the formation and concentrated his forces to break through the center; on the other hand, the coalition forces were on high ground, which increased their impact. The Athenian center was almost pushed back. The front collapsed inward. Fortunately, the soldiers who arrived one after another strengthened the depth of the center and maintained this precarious front.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo, who was in the formation, also felt this change. Originally, he couldn't even stretch his arms, but now he could do it freely. But he didn't have time to think about other things. His face was scratched, his right shoulder was pierced, and the enemy's pressure on him was getting greater and greater. He just blocked and stabbed mechanically, and was numb to the pain.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Suddenly, the opponent stopped attacking.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The noise came from far away and quickly came: \"We lost!

Unfortunately, the coalition soldiers were not Spartan warriors and were unable to hold out until the Athenian center was breached. The two wings of the Sicilian coalition forces eventually collapsed under the fierce attack of the Athenians.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The coalition army's center army began to retreat in an orderly manner, but soon they all fled backwards.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Athenian army took advantage of the situation and pursued. Hero followed for a while and stabbed to death two enemies who fell behind. After the previous hellish battle, Hero quickly transformed from a rookie into a warrior.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this time, the Athenians had been scattered because of chasing the enemy, the Athenian flag was submerged in the crowd, and Demosthenes Eurymedon was nowhere to be found.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As soon as Xiluo stopped, he was immediately overwhelmed by fatigue and pain. Although the battle lasted only about 20 minutes, it consumed a lot of mental and physical energy. Xiluo really wanted to fall down immediately and have a good sleep. But the current situation did not allow him to relax.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The bleeding from the wound on my right shoulder has stopped.

When the soldiers who were scouting the situation reported that the coalition forces were defeated and the enemy was attacking the camp, the traditional Greek leader regretted it. He immediately summoned more than 200 of his men and said to them: \"Warriors of Boeotia, the coalition forces were defeated. It was the messenger's mistake that we failed to participate in the battle. But people who don't understand the situation will say that we are cowards who dare not participate in the battle, and even say that we caused the failure of the coalition forces to absolve them of guilt.

Unexpectedly, Alcibiades escaped and Lamachus died in battle. He became the only general in the expedition, but the troops suffered a series of defeats and were in a bad situation. After the reinforcements arrived, he hoped that Demosthenes, who had rich combat experience, could turn the defeat around and let him return home with dignity. Unexpectedly, a defeat made them decide to retreat immediately. Returning to Athens, Nicias naturally had to bear the main responsibility for the failure of the entire campaign.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nicias did not show his anxiety.

The battles were mainly with neighboring city-states, and both sides lined up in battle array. Fighting was customary, and the battles could often be ended in one day and the troops could return to the city. The whole process was simple, the army was crudely organized, and there was no logistics system.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After the reform of Cleisthenes, the Athens area was divided into dozens of demos (equivalent to villages), and the order of all the demos was disrupted, each belonging to thirty regions. During the slack season, each demo organized military training, and soldiers were drawn before war and commanded by generals or senior commanders. The battles were still simple and there was no strict military system.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Until the conflict with Sparta, each war lasted no longer just one day, but one month, two months, or even more than a year (such as the Sicily Expedition). Athens' old military system could no longer meet the needs of war and had to be reformed, and the model to learn from was its enemy, Sparta.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The biggest difference between the Spartan army and all the Greek city-states is that its soldiers are all professional soldiers. During the Greco-Persian War, a Spartan general asked his allied soldiers from various city-states what their occupations were. Everyone answered enthusiastically, including bricklayers, potters, vendors... Only the Spartan soldiers said nothing. Seeing this, the Spartan general laughed and said that only we Spartans are real warriors.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Spartans began to receive training from a young age, and did nothing else in their lives except training and fighting. Therefore, they were stronger than other city-states in terms of combat skills, tactics, and military organization.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The enemy is the best teacher. Although Athens could not have professional soldiers, it learned from Sparta in terms of military system in order to better organize soldiers to fight. They divided the army into smaller units, with the smallest combat unit being a squad, which consisted of 10 people, enough to form a small 8x8 square, and the captain was a soldier with rich combat experience.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As the captain, Picos led sixty warriors (four of whom died during the night attack) and thirteen slaves① and tremblingly left the camp. Knowing that this expedition might be a life-or-death struggle, the morale of the team dropped to the bottom, and everyone complained, with the focus on Hero.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiero knew he was in the wrong, so he just kept his head down and walked. Timasus occasionally argued a few words, and the captain Picos maintained order, so the whole team did not disperse.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The crowd walked slowly to the bridge, and after Picos' repeated urging and no sign of the enemy on the other side, they carefully crossed the bridge.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Yesterday, countless Athenian soldiers tried to escape back to the camp, and many of them died on the other side of the river. The blood flowed like a river. A day of drizzle could not erase the traces. The land turned dark red, and blood would ooze out when you stepped on it. Although the bodies had been collected, the air was filled with a fishy smell under the scorching sun, and from time to time you could see piles of mosquitoes and flies gathering in the bloody puddles on the roadside.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This situation made everyone feel sad. They walked more heavily and spoke less.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After walking a little further, he still saw no trace of the enemy, so Picos secretly wondered: Did the enemy retreat?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He turned around and shouted: \"Brothers! After going around this hill, we will set foot on the mountain road to Eriboli Heights. When the time comes, we only need to send someone to sneak up and find out the position of the Sicilian coalition forces, and then we can return to the camp.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos' words cheered up everyone.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Just then, someone shouted: \"Cavalry! There are cavalry!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      A cavalryman suddenly appeared fifty meters ahead, wearing red leather armor and a helmet with a red tassel.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After a moment, he turned his horse and galloped back along the road.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Quickly form a line! Get ready to meet the enemy!\" Picos, who had come to his senses, shouted anxiously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As soon as he finished speaking, Hero felt the ground shaking under his feet. He hurriedly put on his helmet, took off his round shield from his shoulders, and moved closer to Picos. The warriors quickly formed a small square, and the slaves who were exploring the way in front also quickly ran to the back of the square.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The ground was shaking more and more violently, and there seemed to be a series of thunders coming from the front, rumbling towards the Picos team.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Soon, a group of cavalry appeared from the corner of the hill and charged straight towards them.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the past, watching cavalry battles on TV was exciting, but not very thrilling. Now that he was in the middle of it, Shiloh only felt that the fast-running horses were unstoppable, the shining spear tips made him feel cold, and the rapid sound of horse hooves seemed to be hitting his chest. Although there were only more than twenty horses, the momentum made Shiloh's legs tremble.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Damn it, it's Kira's cavalry.\" Picos beside him cursed in a low voice, then raised his spear and shouted: \"Brothers, kill them!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What? Fight against the cavalry!\" Shiloh was a little stunned for a moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Kill!!!\" Led by Picos, the entire phalanx let out a huge roar and charged forward with spears.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But the collision did not happen. The Kira cavalry threw short spears more than ten meters away from the phalanx. More than twenty short spears pierced into the dense phalanx with great kinetic energy.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Javelin cavalry!\" A thought flashed through Shiloh's mind, and everyone raised their shields for protection. Only Picos shouted anxiously, \"Charge! Charge quickly!!\" However, in the chaotic situation of people shouting and horses neighing, there was no response.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh heard screams coming from behind him, his heart tightened.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After this round of attacks, everyone followed Picos and charged forward again. But the cavalry had already passed the right side of the square, made a circle, returned to the original path, and charged again.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The square formation stopped again, and screams rang out again. The already low morale of the people began to flee under the threat of death.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos was anxious, waving his hands and shouting at the top of his voice: \"Don't run back! Quick! Retreat to the mountain! Retreat to the mountain!!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Some of the heavy infantry that had not yet collapsed began to move towards the hill on the left.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Not long after they ran, the third wave of attack from the Kira cavalry arrived.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The short spears fell into the crowd with a \"whoosh\". Hiro heard Timathus groaning and falling to the ground with a \"thump\". He subconsciously turned sideways to look.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Be careful!\" he heard Picos shouting, a round shield covered his exposed back, and with a \"bang\", a short spear pierced into the hard iron shield. Shiloh was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat, and just as he was about to express his gratitude, Picos screamed and fell to the ground, and a short spear pierced his left leg.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Captain!\" Shiloh felt extremely guilty at the moment and wanted to help him, but Picos pulled him away: \"Don't worry about me! Run! Go to the mountain!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Looking at Picos's face twisted by pain, Shiloh suddenly burst into tears: In his previous life, apart from his parents, who else cared for him! Not to mention the price of his life! He threw away the round shield without hesitation and took Picos' arm tightly: \"Captain, even if I die, I will take you with me!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Seeing the determined look on Shiloh's face, Picos said nothing more. He gritted his teeth and endured the great pain. He propped up his body with his right foot, leaned on Shiloh, and hopped forward.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After walking a few steps, another person supported Picos from the other side.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo opened his eyes wide in surprise: \"Brother, you——\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The pale Timasus patted his breastplate, which had a deep dent on it: \"Fortunately, my armor is very thick.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      A heavy weight fell from Xi Luo's heart. Now, there were people in this world who cared about him, and there were people he cared about.

So they urged their horses to chase the fleeing enemies. The enemy had no fighting spirit, so the cavalry had no scruples. They either knocked down the fleeing soldiers with their horses or stabbed them with their spears, and screams were heard everywhere on the battlefield.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hero and Timathus carried Picos back to the hill, but gradually fell behind the team.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh heard the sound of horses' hooves behind him, and when he looked back, he was shocked: in the distance, two cavalrymen were charging towards them!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Run!

Early city-state wars often ended within a day, and the Greeks liked to take slaves to battle. However, in the battle between Athens and Sparta, as the war expanded, the slaves accompanying the army were managed by the army, building camps, assisting in combat, carrying siege equipment, etc., and casualties increased. A slave in Athens was worth dozens of drachmas, and an ordinary family had only one or two slaves, who were strong laborers in the family. Of course, they were reluctant to let them die in vain, so taking slaves to battle became a luxury for the rich.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The group of five finally climbed up the hill and were no longer chased by cavalry on the way.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The reason was simple: the cavalrymen had been chasing the scattered heavy infantrymen, and it would be difficult for them to regroup to deal with Hero and his men. The fate of the first two cavalrymen warned the others that the enemy was very strong and could not be dealt with by one or two cavalrymen. In a city-state, most of the cavalrymen were nobles, because raising horses was very expensive, and they were all rich, so they valued their lives more.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Watching the enemy slaughtering their compatriots at the foot of the mountain, the Athenians who fled to the hill turned pale and trembled, and some even cried out of fear.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It's all Shiloh's fault. He's the one who caused us to become like this! He's not God's messenger, he's Pandora's disaster!\" Misconon jumped out and pointed the finger at Shiloh, and immediately received responses from many people.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Seeing that what happened yesterday was about to happen again, Timasus stepped forward and said, \"Are you still worthy of being called great Athenians? When the Spartans occupied Attica and took away your farms and land, who provided you with bread every day? When the night attack failed, who used prophecies to let you return safely? Misconon, tell me, who is our benefactor?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Misconon stammered, “But because of him, we were sent here to die.”\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timathus laughed: \"When Agamemnon was almost driven into the sea by the Trojans because of his jealousy of Achilles, he never thought that it was Achilles who saved the army.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Yes! Yes! If Shiloh can save us once, he can save us a second time.\" The frightened people couldn't wait to grab any life-saving straw.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment, Hilo was helping Picos remove the short spear. He pressed the wound for a while and breathed a sigh of relief: Fortunately, the aorta was not pierced.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So he drew his dagger, cut off the tip of the spear that pierced his thigh, and then quickly pulled out the dagger.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos clenched his teeth and said nothing.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Is the sword burning red?

Shiloh looked at the wound that was bleeding and became a little nervous. He closed his eyes and pressed the dagger down.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Sizzle!\" Picos couldn't help but scream.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh didn't hesitate any longer and then burned the wound on the other side.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Ah!

This was not something that could be explained in a few words. He stammered, \"Doing this will help your leg injury heal faster.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos nodded, not quite understanding, and didn't ask any more questions. He took the crutch made of tree branches from Herim, tried to walk a few steps, and immediately praised: \"Shilo, I didn't expect your method to be so effective! Look, although my legs are still painful, they are not swollen or swollen. I think they are much better than those priests in the temple! Who did you learn this from?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"In the dream...\" Shilo pointed to the sky solemnly, but a bitterness arose in his heart: in his previous life, he was seriously ill and unwilling to give up. He read a lot of medical information, hoping to find a glimmer of hope. In addition to mastering some basic medical knowledge, he finally failed to escape the clutches of death.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos was taken aback by his mysterious attitude.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh quickly changed the subject: \"Captain, why did you ask us to charge forward instead of defending in place when facing these cavalrymen?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Defend where we are?\" Picos shook his head. \"That would only make us a target for the Kirra people. They would form a large circle and surround us. Using the characteristics of horses, they would spin around constantly, throwing javelins at us, or stabbing us with spears. With enemies all around us, our morale wouldn't last long. I encountered this situation when I was helping Thessaly fight the Macedonians in northern Greece.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"But they dare not fight head-on with our heavy infantry. Our iron shields and spears can easily make them fall off their horses.\" Picos' words gradually became more proud. Like other Greeks, he had the complex that heavy infantry was invincible. \"If they didn't sprint on horseback, the javelins they threw would not be able to penetrate our armor at all, because they can't use their full strength on horseback. While they are sprinting, I will let you rush forward, take advantage of their inability to turn quickly①, stick to them, and fight with them, then victory will be ours! What a pity...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cavalry without stirrups! Shiloh suddenly realized that he had read in a book before: Cavalry in this era had no stirrups or saddles, and could not fight infantry head-on. They mostly used javelins and archery, and lacked accuracy. If they really wanted to stab the enemy, they had to release their spears immediately at the moment of stabbing, otherwise they would fall off their horses due to the reaction force.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Yes, Shiloh (Liu Hai) had learned this knowledge, but in the dusty battlefield where life and death were at stake, he was as confused as an idiot and could not remember it at all. He was still a novice in real war and needed experience, a process of combining theory with actual combat.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos sighed heavily again: \"Now we have suffered too much loss, we can only retreat. Although the Kira people's javelins are powerful, as long as our formation is not messed up, in fact, not many people will die. Once we cross the bridge, we will be safe.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We can't retreat!\" Hero objected without hesitation. Now, he finally understood Demosthenes' plan. On the surface, there was no clear goal for their tour, but as long as they returned to the camp without any achievements, the soldiers would deepen their suspicion of him being the \"God's Blessed One\" through propaganda. Not to mention that they had suffered countless casualties and fled back.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      By then, he would have no way of calling on Nurnusis to help him escape, and he would not be able to withstand the wrath of the soldiers.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We don't have to retreat at all!\" Hiro realized that he was too enthusiastic. He lowered his voice to convince Picos: \"Just like my slaves did, we can easily repel the Kira people with spears and javelins.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Your slaves?\" Picos glanced at Herim and Secito, \"They used to be hunters, didn't they? We haven't been trained to throw javelins. Who would be willing to throw out the spears that protect themselves and then wait for the enemy to rush in with empty hands? The Kira people are not fools. They won't come close to us. As long as they are on guard, it will be difficult for your slaves to pierce the fast-running cavalry with javelins.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hrim was dissatisfied with Picos' words, but fortunately he remembered his duty and did not refute.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sesito was very calm. He had fought against Macedonian cavalry many times in the first half of his life and had a deep understanding of cavalry. He thought what Picos said made sense, but he could not express his support in front of his master, so he remained silent.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We can only retreat! Retreat is our only way to survive!\" Picos vaguely understood why Shiloh didn't want to retreat, but he couldn't gamble the lives of a small team for one person, even if that person just saved his life. Seeing others gathering around him, he spoke loudly again.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As soon as he finished speaking, Misconon yelled, \"Picos, are you crazy? Do you want us to die again?!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As this person cursed, everyone began to blame him. For the Athenians who had just escaped from the disaster, their hearts were filled with fear and they had no courage to face the Gira cavalry.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Picos's idea was good, but he overestimated the morale of the soldiers. Hero watched coldly from the sidelines, and the frightened Athenians became his helpers.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Just as Picos was struggling to cope with the criticism, someone shouted, \"Look! The Kira people are going back to call for reinforcements!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Everyone was shocked.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      I saw a Kira cavalryman galloping towards the mountain road leading to the Eripoli Highlands not far away, while the rest of the enemies gathered in front of the bridge. Their intention was very obvious: they wanted to catch them all in one fell swoop.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Everyone was panicked, and some people immediately knelt down and cried and prayed: \"Great and wise Athena, the protector of Athens! Please save us.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brothers, we must retreat immediately! Otherwise, we will be dead when the enemy infantry arrives!\" Picos took the opportunity to raise his arms and shout.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Everyone was still a little hesitant, but no longer as impulsive as before. After all, even if there were casualties in retreat, it was better than staying and being wiped out.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"We can't retreat!\" The situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and it was extremely unfavorable for Shiloh, forcing him to take a risk: \"The oracle told me that the enemy's reinforcements will not come at all!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Remark:\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      1.

But at this moment, he had no room to retreat: \"Last night, I had a dream. The scene in the dream was exactly the same as now, but the enemy's reinforcements did not come.

Shiloh's eyes flashed, and he didn't care about much anymore. He suddenly pulled open the linen lining, revealing his muscular chest. There was a scar as big as a bowl on his right chest: \"Picos, are you questioning the oracle?!\" Shiloh took a step forward and asked fiercely: \"Is it true that I was shot through the chest and resurrected?! Is it true that I told you that the night attack would fail?! Is it also false that I used the method taught by God to heal your leg?!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Faced with Shiloh's overwhelming momentum, Picos was speechless for a moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Those who originally wanted to retreat were shaken.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment, Timasus stood up and said: \"In fact, there is a very simple way to verify whether Hero's oracle is true or false.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He climbed up a large rock leisurely and pointed to the north: \"Can we see the end of the mountain road from here?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Yes!

The main occupation of the men in the town was fishing, and they also worked part-time as pirates. Eraus fought on the sea with his father before he was an adult. He went from having nothing to becoming the leader of more than 90 pirates. In addition to his ferocity, he was also cunning.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment, the semicircular slope surrounding the small beach made him feel a little uneasy. He recalled the process of encountering this merchant ship before, and there was no sign that their encounter was planned in advance. In fact, he did not expect to enter this sea area. He usually operated along the Egyptian coast.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Hamon, are you sure only twenty or thirty of them escaped?\" he asked the lookout.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Boss, even though the distance is far and I can't see clearly, I believe in my judgment!\" Hamon said confidently.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hamon was his best lookout and rarely made mistakes. Eraus felt more at ease, but he still decided to be careful: \"Yuik, take a few people to check first.\" He decided that if there was nothing in the ship, he would retreat. Anyway, the bottom of the ship must have been damaged after such a big impact, and he didn't have time to stay here to repair it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Under the watchful eyes of Eraus, Yuik led three men to the shore in a small boat, and then boarded the merchant ship carefully. Everything went smoothly. Soon his excited voice was heard: \"Boss, we are rich! Here are bundles of armor, a lot of food, oh, and a lot of wood!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When the pirates heard this, their eyes turned red.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Eraus thought more: He heard that there was a big war in Sicily. Could it be that the merchant ship carrying supplies to them had deviated from its course?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Facing the pirates' burning gazes, Eraus, who was also stimulated, decisively gave the order: \"Dock!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Oh! Oh!...\" The pirates screamed, waved their daggers and spears, raised their simple wooden shields, and ran up the slope like crazy like hungry wolves.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sometimes people were shot down, but they were not afraid and crawled faster.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The top of the slope was very close to the beach, and in a moment, the pirates were approaching the archers.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Kill these stinky fish!

The pirates' thin wooden shields were no match for them and they were immediately shot down.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But before they could throw the second round, the following pirates had already climbed to the top of the slope.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brothers, kill!\" Along with Shiloh's shouts, the heavy infantrymen who had been lying in ambush in the bushes could not wait to raise their round shields and rushed towards the pirates.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      One side was not yet firmly established, while the other side was gathering strength; one side had a simple wooden shield, while the other had a thick iron shield. The two sides collided, and the heavy infantry had a clear advantage, and many pirates were knocked down the slope.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      However, the pirates who had lived a bloodthirsty life on the sea for many years did not retreat. Instead, their ferocity was aroused. They howled and fought with the heavy infantry who were not wearing armor.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo was in the center of the team. As soon as he rushed forward, he knocked down a man. Before he could do anything, Secito behind him immediately pierced the man's chest with his spear. Hilo stepped over the corpse and rushed towards the pirate behind him with his iron shield. His strength was so great that the pirate was knocked off balance, revealing the gap between his right ribs. His spear pierced out like lightning, accompanied by a scream, and deeply penetrated the enemy's right chest. He pulled back, but failed to pull out the spear. It turned out that he used too much force and the spear head was stuck in the enemy's ribs.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Be careful, master!\" Sesito used his spear to block the spear that the enemy beside him was stabbing at Shilo.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh quickly drew out the dagger from his waist, lowered his head and moved forward, and the dagger cut the enemy's lower abdomen, and blood splashed on his face.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Hehe!\" The salty liquid made him extremely excited. Perhaps it was the \"Shilo\" in his body that was working. He took Secito's spear and rushed forward again.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Shilo, come back soon!\" Picos shouted anxiously behind him. This long formation with extremely deep depth had a gap in the middle because Shilo advanced too quickly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But Picos was obviously overly worried. Hilo, Secito and Hrim behind him supported each other, hacking and killing the enemy, which not only frightened the enemy, but also greatly boosted the morale of their companions. The pirates had been running hard before, suffered a series of attacks, and their formation was loose and their equipment was inferior to that of the enemy. At this moment, they could only defend themselves, and had no ability to fight back.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hamon saw the pirates rolling down the slope on the boat, and tried desperately to climb up, trying to rejoin the battle, but was shot down by arrows from the enemies on the top of the slope, and screams were heard everywhere.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He was filled with regret and anger. If he had not been fooled by the enemy and miscalculated the number of people, how could they have suffered such a heavy loss? Those who died were all fellow villagers in the same city. How could he face his relatives when he returned?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brothers, follow me to support the boss!\" he shouted.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What about the slaves in the ship?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Kill them all!\" Hamon said coldly with red eyes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Eraus was almost regretting his decision. He was lured here by the enemy and was now in a dilemma: if he retreated, his team would suffer heavy losses under the attacks of arrows and the pursuit of the enemy; if he stayed, his brothers, although capable of fighting alone, would be powerless under the enemy's unified attack. Oh my God, who on earth did I mess with? They were well-trained soldiers!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      While he was hesitating, he saw a strong man holding a spear, rushing towards him aggressively.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He quickly raised his wooden shield to block.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The sharp spear tip was blocked, but the force it released made his arm numb.

At such a short distance, he could hardly dodge, so he subconsciously raised his right hand.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Ah!\" He screamed, and the short spear nailed his right hand to the wooden shield.

Salamis Island has become a natural barrier for Athens at sea. Athens has a large number of troops stationed on the island, and it is the naval base of Athens. If the island is occupied by the enemy one day, Athens will be completely finished.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When the cargo ship that Hilo was on arrived at the entrance of the waterway, Hilo was stunned by the scene in front of him: thousands of ships of all sizes densely packed the entire waterway, and the countless towering masts seemed like a dense forest, with countless seabirds resting on them, repairing their feathers, chirping, and resting. Compared with the leisure of the birds, the people on the boats were much busier. They carefully steered the boats to glide between the gaps between the boats. When the two boats were side by side, they did not forget to greet each other, asking where the other party came from, what goods they were selling, etc., to kill time, because the speed of progress was too slow.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is just like the most common traffic jam in modern metropolises, but it is even more spectacular because it happens at sea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Because there were warships leading the way, their ships were relatively fast. Seeing the ships passing by one after another, Hero's heart could not help but be filled with blood: Yes, decades ago, the Athenians abandoned their homes and fought a decisive battle with Persia at sea in this waterway. The highest point of Salamis Island on the left should have been the place where the Persian Emperor Xerxes stayed, and it was there that he watched his huge navy being defeated by the Greeks.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Prepare to enter the port!\" Nurnusis's voice interrupted Shilo's thoughts.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The waterway ahead suddenly became wider, and the cargo ship turned right: an extremely noisy and busy world appeared in front of Hilo, with countless sailboats, countless docks, and countless goods!

Athens could not defeat Sparta on land, but the ocean was Athens' lifeline. So he persuaded the people to build a straight road connecting Athens and Piraeus Port, about 13 kilometers long, and built three high walls to surround Athens and Piraeus Port. These two projects were huge, but fortunately they were successfully completed before the war began. The war went as Pericles expected. The Athenians lost all their land except the city and the port, and huddled in the city. The tall walls blocked the Spartan attack.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo was running fast on the straight road leading to Athens. There were endless tents beside the straight road. Sometimes men, women, old and young could be seen lying on the ground basking in the sun. They were pale, thin and dazed. Hilo glanced sideways frequently. From Hilo's memory, he knew that these people were Athenians living outside the city. The entire Attica Peninsula used to be the land of Athens. More than ten years of war caused Athens to lose all the land except the city and the port. A large number of refugees poured into the city, causing the population to expand. Food, housing, water... all aspects were extremely tense. In addition to using the provident fund to purchase a large amount of food from the Black Sea, the council also called on the rich in the city to lend a hand and help the city government tide over the difficulties. Hilo's family once provided relief to a group of refugees for a long time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"War!\" Hilo sighed as he looked at the two city walls about a hundred meters away from the straight road. What was the situation of the Spartans who had been stationed on Athenian soil for a long time outside the wall?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh's family lived on a street not far from the city gate. At this time, several horse-drawn carts were parked outside Shiloh's house, and slaves were putting furniture and sculptures on the carts. Many people were watching the carts, most of whom had received help from Shiloh's family. When they learned that the only descendant of this family was trapped in Sicily, they still had a glimmer of hope, but the current situation made them start to worry about tomorrow's life.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The slaves in the courtyard were also worried about the future. Perhaps because Hepias' great-great-grandfather and Solmus were slaves, they treated slaves kindly, rarely beat or scolded them, provided them with sufficient food, and even gave them wine mixed with water during festivals... etc. Now, they were all terrified when they saw the ferocious-looking Athenian standing in front of them.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sostia was very excited. When Goricanon asked him to bring people here to search the house in the morning, he knew that Sulmus was completely finished. As a manager, he once looked up to Sulmus for his wealth and power, but now he can easily trample him under his feet. As for why the Shilo family owed Goricanon such a huge debt, he only knew that several big figures in the council played a role in it. He didn't care about this. He only cared about making a fortune again, in addition to what Goricanon promised him. The things here are not recorded in the account book. Oh! These furniture made of fine wood, marble sculptures from famous artists, and those exquisite pottery... Who would know if he took some home!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As for these slaves, one must admit that the Hero family was one of the richest families in Athens, and even the female slaves had good looks and figures. Sostia's greedy eyes swept over the female slaves, and suddenly his eyes locked on one person.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is a beautiful slave girl.

It was a famous residential area for foreign merchants in Athens. According to Athenian law, non-citizens of Athens were not allowed to own land in Athens. Foreign merchants who came to Athens to trade either stayed in an inn or rented land from Athenian citizens. The southwest of Athens was far from the central political area of ​​Athens and was close to the straight road. It was too noisy with people coming and going.

The house next to Athena is the Parthenon, representing culture and economy. Originally I wanted to make the background appear in the blue of the Aegean Sea to represent love, but I found that the effect was not good. The current color can better express the solemnity of history. However, I have written the classic \"School Love Record\" before, so I should be able to write a good love story, right?!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      War, power, economy, culture, and love, these are all I want the cover to express.

He lost his son, who he was proud of and relied on for the future, and also lost Hero, who he had loved and supported for many years. He spent the day in a daze, and in the evening, Hero's second guardian, General Pionidus (the first guardian was Pericles, but he died early) suddenly came to visit.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Pionidos said directly that since Hero died without any direct or collateral relatives and without leaving a will, according to Athenian law, Hero's property had to be transferred to the public. Then all his property, including the current residence in Surmus, which was purchased in the name of Hero, had to be taken back.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      What, he asked, was Solms going to do?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sulms was panicked, he was so lost that he actually forgot about this matter. For many years, he was used to a life of being bossed around and pampered, and now he had to go back to a life of being homeless, which of course he couldn't accept.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So, Pionidos told him that he could sign an IOU for Helo's debt with Gorikanon, a merchant from Chios, and transfer Helo's property to Gorikanon in the form of repayment. If successful, Surmus would also get a small portion of the property. If Surmus disagreed, he would use his connections to drive Surmus out of Athens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      These words, half temptation and half threat, kept Solmus awake all night. He finally wrote the IOU and helped Gorikanon to transfer the property. But when Gorikanon proposed to move all the things of Hero's house, Solmus objected because there were bronze statues of Hepias and other generations of masters there, and he would not allow others to desecrate them. He went to Gorikanon to plead with him early this morning, but was driven out by Gorikanon. Unexpectedly, he ran into Hero on the way back.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Father!

For a case involving such a huge property dispute, at least 501 jurors were needed, and they were all Athenian citizens.

If the master had not ordered them not to make any noise, they would have really wanted to praise the young master loudly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment in the hall, Hero sat in the middle, and on both sides of him were Surmus, Timathus, Cecitus and Herim.

He found that after returning, Shiloh was no longer the reckless boy he had been before. He seemed mysterious and unpredictable, and he could not see through him.

He was at a loss as to what to say. He had been serving the Shiloh family all his life, but he had not saved so much money. His eyes were completely dazzled by the light of the silver coins. He couldn't help but reach out and grab a handful, muttering: \"This is too much...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh watched Sulmus' every move, smiled slightly, and turned to Timasus; \"Brother, this trip to Sicily is thanks to you--\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus immediately interrupted him: \"Helo, don't thank me or give me anything.

Hero drank a lot and felt a little hungry. He stretched out his hand (the ancient Greeks ate with their hands, not knives and forks, but with their hands), and it turned out to be a piece of bread. He actually didn't like this dry thing at all. But in this era, in the Mediterranean, there was no rice.

According to his memory, Hilo knew that it was his \"great-great-grandfather\", who came from the mountains of Macedonia and was once a slave of a Lydian nobleman, responsible for the manufacture of weapons. Once the master went out of the city and met a lioness on the road, everyone fled in all directions, only his great-great-grandfather stood up and fought with the lion with the strength he had gained from years of blacksmithing. He finally drove away the lioness, saved the master, and was granted freedom. Later, due to the war between Lydia and Persia and the turbulent times, he came to Athens by boat and settled in the port of Piraeus. He made a living by making shields and spears for others. Gradually, he became famous and then had his own weapons workshop. In the Greco-Persian War, he became an Athenian foreign soldier and died in the Battle of Plataea.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The second statue is a simple-looking man who is looking at the account book in his hand seriously. Hero knew that this was his great-grandfather. After his great-great-grandfather died, as the only son, his great-grandfather took over the family business, worked hard to expand the customer base, and finally became a famous weapons manufacturer in Athens. With sufficient funds, he began to get involved in other industries: pottery making, textiles and simple currency exchange. Just when the family business was thriving, bad news came: his two sons followed General Cimon to recover the Greek city-states occupied by the Persians in Asia Minor, and died in battle with the Persian navy. The great-grandfather fell ill and his business suddenly stagnated and began to lose money. At this time, his youngest son rushed back from Egypt.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The third statue is Hero's grandfather, pointing his finger into the distance with a high spirit. In his grandfather's generation, due to the relatively affluent life, the grandfather, as the youngest son, loved to play since childhood. When he grew up, he liked adventure travel. He went to many places, made many friends, and became knowledgeable. When he rushed back home, the family business had declined rapidly. He raised the remaining funds against all odds, bought a ship, and started maritime trade. A few years later, he opened up a grain trade shipping channel with the Black Sea, and from then on, he made a fortune. After the first conflict between Athens and Sparta, he led a fleet to deliver grain to the Athenian army on the expedition when he was over fifty years old. He encountered a storm on the way and sank with the ship.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The fourth statue is Hero's father, Hepias, who makes powerful gestures and seems to be giving a speech to others. Although Hepias' father is rich, he has one biggest regret, which is that he cannot become an Athenian citizen. Hepias received the best education in Athens since he was a child. When he grew up, in order to realize his father's last wish, he made friends with Athenian nobles, went to various social occasions, donated money to the council many times, and often paid out of his own pocket to let Athenian citizens watch dramas for free. The most important point is that he has long given Pericles' lover Aspasia novel jewelry and perfume bought from all over the world, so that he has the opportunity to go in and out of Pericles' mansion from time to time. Pericles called him \"my close partner\", so he applied for the proposal of Athenian citizens to pass the council, but was rejected at the citizens' assembly. Until Hepias died to protect Pericles, Pericles gave him a touching speech at the citizens' assembly. He said that if people like this who have donated their lives for the defense of Athens for four generations are not Athenian citizens, then who else in the world can deserve this great title!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Finally, the proposal was passed unanimously: when Hepias' son came of age, he would be granted Athenian citizenship, and until then he would be under the guardianship of Pericles.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      These four simple bronze statues condense the hard struggle of an expatriate family in Athens. The blood of four generations laid the foundation for what Helo is today.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh touched the cold bronze statue, feeling a sense of identification in his complex emotions.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      What will I be carved into after I die? This thought popped up in his mind, and suddenly his desire to achieve great things became extremely strong.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"When you were a child, your father thought you looked very much like your great-great-grandfather. If he were still alive, he would be very happy to know your current situation!\" Solms' voice rang out in the room.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh looked at the statue again. Indeed, Shiloh was tall, with broad shoulders and a thick chest, and his figure was somewhat similar to his great-great-grandfather. In addition, he had a high forehead, a big face, a straight nose, thick lips, blue eyes, and golden curly hair. Although he was not handsome, he exuded an impressive majesty. No wonder his teammates called him the \"Lion of Nicaea\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle Sulms, thank you for bringing the map.\" Shiloh took the papyrus map from Sulms and slowly unfolded it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is a map of the Mediterranean. Compared with modern maps, it is too crude, marking only the land around the Mediterranean, the main mountains, rivers, islands and city-states. To the east, to the Pillars of Hercules at the exit of the Mediterranean, they did not know that there were two large islands in the northwest, much larger than Sicily, inhabited by Celts with blue tattoos; to the east, to Persia, they did not know that to the east of Persia was India, and to the northeast of India was a mysterious Eastern civilization; to the north, as far as Thrace, they did not know that further north in the cold and gloomy Black Forest were inhabited by blond, white-skinned, blue-eyed Germans; to the south, to Numidia, they did not know that beyond the Sahara, there would be a magical land.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is the world that the Greeks can know! Hero closed the map and said, \"Uncle Solmus, has my brother told you the true story of our escape from Sicily?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solmus stepped forward and whispered, \"Shiloh, did you really see the Olympian gods in your dream?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo smiled but did not answer. Instead, he asked, “Uncle, do you know what the biggest problem with this matter is?”\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Keep it a secret!\" Sulmus blurted out.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"That's right!\" Hilo looked at Surmus and said solemnly, \"There are more than fifty of us back. Although we have a unified voice, the more people who know the secret, the greater the possibility of leakage. Although the Athenians worship the gods, they do not believe in them. They have not seen the miracles with their own eyes. They will not believe that we are guided by the gods. They only believe that we are deserters. The relatives of those who died in the battle will curse us! And how many people in this city are coveting my family's wealth. They will rush over at this time and eat us up!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro has always had a strong sense of crisis, because he extremely cherishes the second life he has gained, especially when he just returned to Athens, his property was almost seized, which made this sense of crisis even stronger.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I once asked my eldest brother. You know he is a good student who has studied philosophy, law, and oratory in depth. He told me that if it is confirmed that we are indeed deserters, in this tense atmosphere, we will be expelled from Athens and may even be executed. However, the Athenian court has not sentenced anyone to death in recent decades, so this possibility is not great.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      “Uncle Solmus, what should I do in this situation?”\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

His first thought was to run away, leave here, and go to another city-state! However, he was already in his forties, and he had spent most of his life in this city. He was used to life here. He was used to getting up early at dawn, inspecting the workshops, and urging the slaves to load the goods onto the merchant ships; he was used to looking up at the huge statue of Athena on the Acropolis at dusk after a busy day's work, and getting peace from it. What's more, his dream was also placed here, to let his son or grandson become a citizen of this great city, just like the Hero family.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Now let him escape from here and go to another city-state, and everything will have to start all over again! And which city in the world is more prosperous and free than Athens!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So, Solmus pinned his hopes on a glimmer of luck: perhaps they could keep the secret, and over time, the Athenians would gradually forget about Sicily.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So when Xi Luo asked him for advice, he said: \"We can send people to keep an eye on them every day. Once we find someone leaking the secret, we can promptly use money to shut up the mouth of the person who just learned about it. Getting wealth for nothing is much more useful than reporting us!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What if the secret was leaked in public? What if the person who knew it is our enemy? For example, Pionidus Goricanon!\" Shilo stared at him and asked repeatedly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solms's expression changed again and again, and he said unwillingly: \"This may not happen.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This old man lacks courage and sharpness, he is far worse than his son! Although Shilo was anxious, he had to convince him. Without Solmus' cooperation, his plan would be difficult to implement.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle, the failure of the expedition has caused great losses to Athens. The Peloponnesian coalition will surely come back, and Athens will once again fall into years of war. This time Athens will be defeated, it will lose its glory, and fall into civil strife...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Sulms listened indifferently. To him, war would only make the Shiloh family's grain more profitable to sell. Didn't the previous war prove this point?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Seeing that his persuasion had no effect, Hilo decided to change his angle and said, \"Uncle, do you know Carthage?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I know, but I've never been there.\" Sulms was stunned, not knowing why Shiloh suddenly mentioned it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle, do you know how it was built?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solmus shook his head. Although he knew that Shiloh had a purpose for saying this, he was still angry. He had been a slave of Shiloh's family for the past twenty years, and he was not very literate. He had neither the leisure nor the ability to study the history of other countries.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Hundreds of years ago, there was a civil war in Phoenicia. The Phoenician princess led some of her subjects to sail westward and arrived at the Numibia coast in the south of Sicily. They bought a small piece of land near the coast from the local natives and settled down there. They named their place of residence Carthage. Now, Carthage has become a great power in the western Mediterranean!\" As soon as Hilo finished speaking, Sulms shouted, \"Are you going out to buy land?!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo didn't expect that Surmus would suddenly become so excited. He nodded and said, \"Yes, I want to buy a piece of land in advance to prevent us from being driven out of Athens and having nowhere to go.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      For Solmus, if he settled in another city-state, he would still be a foreign resident, so it would be better for him to stay in the prosperous Athens as much as possible. However, building an independent city was different, which meant that he was a citizen of the city from the beginning, and even a nobleman. Of course, he was willing to do it. However, colonization was a huge project that required a lot of manpower, financial resources, and material resources. Only wealthy merchants like Hero or the city-state itself could afford to do it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Shiloh, where are you going to buy land?\" Sulmus asked enthusiastically. In his heart, Sulmus wanted to buy land in Egypt the most, but he knew that this possibility was very small, because Egypt had always been wary of the Greeks under the rule of Persia, so there had never been a history of successful Greek colonization along the coast of Egypt. Of course, there was no need to consider the Mesopotamian Plain, which was the world of the Persians, and Asia Minor had been divided up by the Greeks hundreds of years ago. Sulmus's eyes moved to the north of Greece on the map: \"It would be great if I could buy a piece of land near the Black Sea coast from the Thracians? The land there is very fertile and there is plenty of food!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Black Sea? Shiloh tapped on the map. To be honest, he was a little tempted. However, he had to consider another question: decades later, when Macedonia rose, the first place it would attack was Thrace. If he really built a city on the Black Sea, decades later, would he be sure that his city-state would be able to compete with the Macedonian Kingdom, which had been developing for hundreds of years? Could he be more strategic than Philip, the real founder of the Macedonian Kingdom?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      His finger moved to the northwest of the map, where he had originally envisioned building the city. The exciting colonial era had long passed, and most of the land in the Mediterranean had been occupied, leaving little undeveloped space.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle, what do you think of the Iberian Peninsula and Gaul?\" Based on the knowledge of later generations, Hilo said, \"The Iberian Peninsula has rich mineral resources, and some areas are also fertile, suitable for growing wheat. Although Carthage also took a fancy to it, their colonization process is still very slow. Most of the Gaul region is fertile plains, suitable for growing a large amount of grain and vineyards...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solmus shook his head without even thinking. \"The Gauls are savage and strong, extremely xenophobic, and unlike other natives, they have a large population. If we build a city among them, it would be like a lamb among wolves. Don't even think about the Iberian Peninsula. Why is there no Greek city there? I heard from the people of Tarantum that the people of Magna Graecia also wanted to immigrate there, but they lost several naval battles to the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians regard Iberia as their territory. I'm afraid our ship will be sunk before we get there.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo's wonderful idea was shattered by the reality that Solmus heard, so that he did not dare to speak out his other idea - colonizing the British Isles, because the bravery of the Celts was no less than that of the Gauls, which was clearly stated in Caesar's \"Gallic War\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Imagination is always beautiful, but reality is always cruel. This is not a cyber war game, this is a real world. If you make a wrong choice, you can't reload the game. Xi Luo reminded himself secretly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Seeing that Hilo was silent, Solmus thought for a moment, then pointed to the boot-shaped place on the map and said, \"The southern part of the Italian peninsula may also be an option. Our fleet often goes there to buy and sell goods. As far as I know, the southern seaports have been occupied by the Greeks, while the mountains, hills and part of the plains in the interior are inhabited by the Samnites. They envy our Greek way of life, and if we buy land from them, we should get their consent. If we build a city there, we can do business with the surrounding Greek cities and use their ports to transport goods.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Shiloh, no matter where you buy land, there is one thing you must remember: you are Greek. Only by relying on the Greeks can you survive better!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This sentence touched Shiloh deeply. He said, \"Uncle Solms, you have been doing business for many years and have sufficient experience in this area. I will leave this matter to you, okay?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Leave it to me. I will keep it confidential and give you a reply soon!\" Sulms said confidently, \"You are tired today. Go to bed early!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uncle Sulmus!\" Hiro called Sulmus, \"The slave I brought back has some talent in business. I want you to train him first. Besides, he is Etruscan, so maybe he can play a role in this matter.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solms was stunned for a moment, then he agreed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh watched him leave quietly, revealing a meaningful smile. Although Sulms was quite loyal to his family, leaving all affairs to one person was not his management style in his previous life.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      It’s just the beginning!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Shiloh woke up.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He really didn't want to wake up, because he had a dream last night, in which he lived happily with his parents and younger brother...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He sat on the bed, reminiscing and worrying. Because in his dream, he could no longer remember the appearance of his relatives. After staying in this era for too long, maybe one day, he would really forget the original world...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He was melancholy for a long time before getting out of bed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      I slept very well last night. Fortunately, there were beds in ancient Greece. What if I were reborn in China in this era? Maybe I would need to get used to sleeping and sitting for a while, but no matter how hard it is, it is the place where I was born and raised! ...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Just as he was daydreaming, Su Paite came in with clean water for him to wash. Then he brought clothes. It was actually a rectangular piece of cloth. Su Paite skillfully draped, wrapped and tied it, making it show beautiful draped wavy pleats on Shiloh's body. Finally, Su Paite lifted the two corners of the cloth from the back of Shiloh's left and right shoulders and fixed them with long pins in front. Shiloh moved his hands and legs, and his body inside was hidden and hidden when his clothes fluttered. Fortunately, he had been wearing armor like this for a while since he came to this world, so he had already gotten used to it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then he went into the hall to have breakfast. If it were an ordinary family, they would eat some dry bread, drink some water, and then go out to work in a hurry. Shiloh was different. He soaked bread in wine and threw a few figs and olives into his mouth from time to time. Even so, he still felt inadequate: Greek breakfast was too simple. He really missed fried dough sticks, steamed buns, porridge, pickles, noodles and milk!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After dinner, he decided to go out for a walk. Although he had many impressions of Athens in his memory, they were not as real as seeing it with his own eyes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Most Greeks don't wear shoes in the city. They are used to walking barefoot. As a modern soul, Hero certainly can't adapt to it, so Supete brought slippers. They are called shoes, but in fact they are two pieces of thick cowhide tied with several thin straps.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Could this be the origin of sandals? Shiloh couldn't help but wonder.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Yesterday he was in such a hurry that he had no time to look around his house. When he walked into the yard again, he looked around curiously. His house was similar to the Siheyuan in Beijing, but much larger. There were houses on all four sides, and a courtyard in the middle. Two sides were two-story buildings, where he and his future wife lived; the other two sides were low and narrow bungalows, where the slaves rested, and there was even a stable.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Master!\" Secito and Herim came forward together. They were different from other slaves in Shiloh's family. They were bought to teach Shiloh fighting skills, to fight with him for fun, and to protect his safety.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Let's go out for a walk together.\" Shiloh waved his hand. Shiloh was still a young man after all, and this kind of posture with servants and bodyguards made him feel satisfied. If it were now, it would be the bearing of a rich noble. Of course, at this time, Shiloh was also a rich man in Athens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Where's Timasus?\" he asked, then waved his hand and said, \"Forget it, let him rest at home.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Having said that, he sauntered out the door.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Passing through the alley, he stepped onto the main road that runs through the city from east to west and north to south - Wanling Athena Avenue. These days, because every family is dealing with funerals, there are fewer pedestrians on the road than usual, and funeral processions can be seen from time to time. Workers from the port are constantly coming and going. Some of them are driving sheep or goats and other livestock with whips, some are carrying baskets full of fish, and some are driving carts loaded with agricultural products or other goods. The carts running on solid wheels squeak all the way.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What is that?\" Shilo pointed uncertainly at a tall building in front of him on the right.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Temple of Hephaestus, Master.\" Supete answered with a little surprise.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Because Athens has always been proud of its high level of handicrafts, Hephaestus, the god of fire and craftsmen, is revered in Athens. Hero thought as he watched, completely ignoring Subate's puzzled look.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Going further, on the left side of the avenue stands a multi-colored arcade, with murals on it telling stories of the victory of the Greco-Persian War, the history of Athens, and some Greek myths. The people of the city have long been familiar with these and have ignored this arcade. Only Hero stopped, walked forward, and carefully appreciated each picture. He found that except for the asymmetrical proportions of the facial features and the body, the conception and color matching of each picture were quite good, giving people a lifelike shock.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Hilo squatted down and got close to the stone wall to see a mural at the bottom that told the story of Athena's birth, a woman's voice sounded behind him: \"Miss, look, this person is so interesting!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uma!\" Another woman's voice sounded, and this voice was as melodious as a lark.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh suddenly turned around and was stunned: the woman in front of him had a pair of clear and bright eyes, just like a pool of blue water in the Aegean Sea, which made people intoxicated and savored it. Her wavy black hair was piled high on her head, which set off her pride; her smooth and broad forehead showed her wisdom; her straight nose bridge was a metaphor for her strength; her bright red lips were full of temptation; her slender snow-white neck was elegant; her wide clothes could not cover her plump breasts, her exposed arms were as crystal as white marble, and her tall figure showed her graceful demeanor...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It's you!\" The woman seemed to know him and nodded slightly to him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He was stunned and did not respond.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Thracian slave named Uma next to the woman laughed and said, \"Look, my lady, another fool!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Uma!\" The woman frowned and said, \"It's time to go home!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      People on the main road consciously made way.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When the woman was out of sight, Xi Luo suddenly woke up from a dream and murmured, \"Who is she?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Amphilia, Aspasia's daughter!\" This time, Supet was not surprised by Shiloh's blank reaction. Because this master who loved martial arts and fighting used to love to stay in the gym and stadium in addition to his own fighting field and horse farm, and he rarely asked about other things.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Aspasia?\" Shiloh felt that the name was familiar, but he couldn't remember who it was.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Pericles' prostitute lover!\" Su Peit said ambiguously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As a foreign resident, she suffered all the restrictions faced by all non-Athens-born residents, but foreign residents were free to make a living as they pleased. Aspasia was a weak woman who could only rely on her natural beauty to make a living. So, Aspasia's life in Athens began as a prostitute.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But soon, she stood out from this ancient profession. Because she not only had beauty, but also wisdom. She knew how to seduce men, and learned to hold her own in the company of men, and to show her talents at various banquets. She was eloquent, and her words were sharp and humorous. The Athenians were amazed at her political insights and intoxicated by her passionate speeches. Even Socrates, an aggressive talker, eagerly competed to talk to her, and brought his students to appreciate her eloquent passion.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Many people said: Although there were many prostitutes in Athens, there was only one Aspasia. She became the most popular prostitute in Athens. Wherever she appeared, people's eyes followed. If she was not there during the drinking party, it would become a party attended by men only, with wine used for stimulation.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Until one day, this twenty-something Athenian beauty met the powerful General Pericles. The middle-aged politician, who had just divorced his wife, ignored public opinion and quickly made this woman who could never be his wife the mistress of his home.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The news that a prostitute from another city had become the unofficial wife of their most beloved general shocked the whole city of Athens. From that day on, rumors and gossip never left her. But Aspasia was not afraid and attended various banquets as before. These banquets were often only for men, because Athenian women were not allowed to appear in public (except for some prostitutes), and she was the only exception.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In this male-dominated society, she tenaciously demonstrates the power of women. What courage and wisdom this requires.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But conservative people were not going to let this woman who broke the rules go. A dozen years later, when the Acropolis of Athens was completed, people brought the famous sculptor Phedias, who was responsible for the construction of the Acropolis, to court on charges of corruption and impiety. Aspasia, who had recommended Phedias to Pericles, was also implicated.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In France, Pericles, who was over fifty years old, appeared in court to testify for her. He pleaded with the jurors without hesitation and shed a lot of tears, which led to Aspasia being acquitted.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But a few years later, when Pericles himself was sued and lost his position as general, he could no longer protect his lover. Aspasia was expelled from Athens and forced to wander in Asia Minor...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh learned about Aspasia's story from his memory, he, who came from modern society, did not feel dissatisfaction or contempt for her like ordinary people, but a kind of sincere admiration. He just remembered that Aspasia and Pericles had a son, but he didn't expect that they also had a daughter. So when he saw Supete's weird face, he slapped him on the back of the head: \"What are you laughing at! What's so funny!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Su Paite immediately became obedient.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Amphelia!

Of course Hero knew who she was. Legend has it that she was the goddess of the calm sea and the dazzling sunlight. She was very beautiful and was known as the \"goddess with black eyes\".

When he passed by the altars of the twelve gods, he did not take a close look, but followed the crowd to the right side of the avenue, passed the road shaded by sturdy sycamore trees, tall cypress trees and lush elm trees, and entered the Agora market.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      If Piraeus is the lifeline of Athens, then the Agora is the commercial heart of Athens.

Shiloh even saw some women busy moving goods and buying and selling like men. They were either poor women who had to go out to make a living, or foreign women who were not subject to the various restrictions imposed on the wives and daughters of citizens, so they mixed freely with men in the market.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh saw a thin woman struggling to move a basket of sea fish from a cart to the shelf in the stall. He signaled to Herim to help. But when the goods were put away, when the woman learned that Shiloh and his group were not planning to buy fish, she immediately and rudely drove them away from the stall.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Su Paite scolded the woman for being ungrateful, but Shiloh smiled bitterly: It is the same in ancient and modern times, as long as you give women a chance, you will find that they are as tough as men.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The flow of people in the market was too dense, and Sesito and his men protected Shilo in the middle to prevent him from being bumped into by others. This in turn made those savvy vendors sense the difference in his status.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Hey, young man, here is the complete History written by Herodotus, a very fine papyrus book.

If Cecito and others hadn't stopped them, the anxious sellers would have come up to pull him. Later, Hilo also learned his lesson. He found that the market was divided into different areas according to the goods sold by the merchants. So when someone recommended livestock to him, he said that he was here to buy two-handled long-necked pottery jars. The merchants waved their hands helplessly and said, \"Go, go, go to the pottery jars.\" When he arrived at the pottery jar area, he claimed that he was here to buy perfume. In this way, he encountered less obstruction.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although it was autumn, the Mediterranean sun was still hot. The crowded market was like a sauna. The winter aromas of fish, dried cheese, olives soaked in salt water, new wine with grape flavor, fruits just picked from the trees, and various kinds of vegetables filled the air, mixing with the stronger smells of cattle, donkeys, sheep and pigs, making the smoky air full of a pungent smell.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo finally squeezed through the narrow aisle and came to the center of the market. This was the world of entertainment: burlesque performances, dancing, juggling, magic, all kinds of things, all showing off their talents. Occasionally someone would put an opal into their money jar. If it were peacetime, I think these artists would have earned a good income.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Supet and the others were watching with great interest, but Shiloh was a little impatient.

Instead, he said, \"Practicality is beauty. Most people have deep eyes and can only look forward, but I can look sideways; most people's nostrils point downward, so they can only smell from the bottom up; as for the big mouth and thick lips, they will undoubtedly make my kiss stronger, richer, and have a larger contact surface than that of ordinary people. \"Socrates married a fierce wife, who was not only ugly, but also had a bad temper and often took it out on Socrates for trivial matters. Sometimes, even his students couldn't stand it, but Socrates said, \"Since I have to deal with all kinds of people, if I can tolerate her bad temper, nothing will make me unhappy when talking to others. \"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In short, he was a man with a big heart, a man who could deal with hardships with a normal attitude. But if you think that he debated with people every day and was just good at talking, you are wrong. He participated in many battles in Athens and was extremely brave. Once he rescued Alcibiades who was trapped in the enemy's camp, and another time he rescued his student Xenophon. Many scholars at that time were like this. They were knowledgeable, brave and good at fighting, and at the same time they deeply understood the pain of farming. They were by no means comparable to the experts and professors in modern society who only go in and out of classrooms and laboratories. This was created by the times.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Young man, I see you seem a little confused.\" Seeing that Hero didn't speak for a long time, Socrates asked gently, \"What do you do?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Here it comes, a Socratic question! Xi Luo was inexplicably excited: \"Now I can barely be considered a businessman.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Then, young man, can you tell me what a businessman is?\" Socrates' voice was deep and rich, as if there was a magic guiding Hero to continue.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I don't know what merchants are specifically. I only know that without merchants, farmers who grow wheat will worry about the wheat going moldy and spoiling because they have too much to eat; and residents in the city will worry about not being able to buy flour. On the one hand, merchants pay taxes to the city-state so that the council has the financial resources to purchase equipment and defend the country; on the other hand, merchants will hoard scarce resources, drive up prices, and seek to get rich quickly.\" Shiloh said calmly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Socrates opened his eyes wide and re-examined the young man in front of him. You know, he often asked passers-by in this way, and the arrogant Athenians were often at a loss for words when asked simple questions by Socrates one after another, because they only knew how to make money and make a living, and never stopped to think deeply. This young man was obviously different from them, which made Socrates interested.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Well said! Merchants are as indispensable as carpenters and blacksmiths. They are neither noble because of being rich nor vulgar because of making money.\" The smile on Socrates' ugly face gave people a sense of peace: \"Young man, how can you be a good businessman?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No, in fact, I am not a real businessman, because I know that my business ability is limited, so I let capable managers help me run the business. All I have to do is to trust him while preventing him from abusing his power. I hire experienced sailors as my captains and promote slaves with strong technical skills to be supervisors of my workshops. For the slaves who work for me, I improve their living conditions so that they are happy to work hard for me.\" Shiloh talked eloquently, but in fact, most of the content here is the plan he is conceiving but has not yet implemented: \"Understand yourself, and at the same time understand others, so that everyone can display his talents in a position that suits him. This is how I am a good businessman.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Everyone can use his talents in the position that suits him...\" Socrates repeated this sentence over and over again. This sentence touched him so much that he stopped asking questions and fell into deep thought. Although Socrates has been acting as a spiritual midwife for Athens, inspiring people to discover their own souls and to have the courage to think. In fact, he himself was also thinking: Why did Athens and Sparta continue to fight? Why did Athens, which should be said to be more democratic, go from bad to worse after the death of Pericles?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      How should a city-state be governed? This question often popped up in his mind, and Shiloh's answer about merchants partially fits his unformed political ideas.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The people around him were surprised to see Socrates lost in thought. In the past, only teachers could stump others with questions, but today's situation was very different from usual. So they looked at Hero with new eyes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Hi, hello, my name is Plato, and I am a student of Socrates.\" Plato stood up first and greeted Hero: \"Your answer is very wonderful and philosophical. It is hard to imagine that you are as young as me.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this time, Plato had a broad forehead, clear eyes, and a straight nose... He was a very handsome young man. Shiloh smiled and said, \"You are the wild goose.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Wild geese?\" Plato looked puzzled. It turned out that Hero in his previous life had read an anecdote about him, saying that when he came to Socrates to become his apprentice, Socrates dreamed that a wild goose flew onto his shoulder, so he said, 'Plato will achieve more than I will in the future.' Now it seems that this is fiction. Westerners, like the Chinese, like to impose some supernatural legends on outstanding people to show their uniqueness.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Nothing.\" Hero smiled and said, \"My name is Hero, son of Hepias.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Are you the Hero who joined the army when he just turned 18?!\" a young man behind Plato exclaimed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Besides me, there is probably no other fool named Xiluo.\" Xiluo noticed that the young man had a pair of sharp eyes on his angular face.

Last night, my father came back from the council meeting and told me that a small number of people escaped from Sicily, and Hilo should be one of them.\" Another young man stood up, defended Hilo, and took the initiative to introduce himself: \"Hello, Hilo!

Among Socrates' disciples, he only knew Plato and Xenophon. In fact, he had no interest in philosophy at all. He knew Socrates and Plato only because they were so famous in later generations. So Hero certainly didn't know that Aestithene was also famous in the history of Western philosophy. Aestithene later founded a very interesting philosophical group - the Cynic School.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      For Hero, who was fascinated by ancient Western military conflicts, he was much more interested in Xenophon than Plato, because Xenophon was the first person in ancient Western countries to begin to systematically study war, strategy, and tactics. He led tens of thousands of Greek mercenaries in the retreat from the heart of Persia, wrote the war documentary \"Anabasis\" and \"On the Tactics of Cavalry\". He also studied the relationship between war and economy and wrote \"Economics\"... and so on. He was a military strategist and historian.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even though he did not completely agree with Socrates's views, it did not prevent him from respecting Socrates. Because in this era of ignorance, it was philosophers like Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Socrates who groped for the principles of human thought in the darkness, and gradually let the light of civilized reason illuminate the human mind. And he was just enjoying the results summarized by these people over thousands of years.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Except for the shocking words he made at the beginning to attract Socrates' attention, he did not want to argue with Socrates.

He discovered that not only Xenophon and Plato were outstanding, but others were also excellent.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      My God!

When the assembly was held, all citizens over the age of 18 had the right to participate in the deliberations of the meeting. Sometimes, when there were few people at the meeting, the guards would use ropes dripping with red paint to gather the citizens wandering around the Agora Market and force them to Mount Nyx. If anyone tried to escape and was stained with red paint, he would be regarded as dereliction of duty and punished by the council.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But today's situation was obviously different.

He was overjoyed and squeezed out a seat beside him. Plato did not refuse, sat down, and handed the things in his hand to Hiro.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh looked, he saw bread and a water pitcher.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Why didn't you bring anything?

First, I am not a professional writer. I have a job, and I am quite busy at work, even busier than when I wrote \"School\". As my work experience increases, I have more tasks to undertake, and sometimes I can only squeeze out time to write. When you see that the punctuation marks in the text are different, I was typing it on my mobile phone during work breaks. Second, I admit that I am not one of those gods who can update tens of thousands of words every day. On the one hand, I am not a fast typewriter, and on the other hand, I am more serious about writing. When I write poorly, I often stop to find the feeling. In order to write the moving emotions in \"School\", I often listened to songs and watched videos repeatedly until I had the feeling before I started writing. Third, each update is small, but I can keep updating every day.

It is not like when I was writing in the middle of my school years, I was faced with a series of problems such as postgraduate entrance examinations, writing papers, and applying for professional titles. I was often in a dilemma. Second, I have been conceiving this book since the beginning of last year.

His voice was as powerful as his body: \"I, Astaudas, a warrior of King Agis of Sparta, announce to Athens and its allies the joint decision of the Peloponnesian League on behalf of the Peloponnesian League: 'Because Athens invaded Syracuse, a sub-state of Corinth and an ally of Sparta without reason, it has seriously violated the original peace treaty.

Originally, he was just going to sit and listen quietly, but he was affected by the waves of curses from the people around him and started to curse as well. This curse released all the pressure and fear he had been under during this period. He felt very comfortable inside, and thought about the fans shouting and yelling on TV before. Could it be that they were also venting their anger?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Agesenos raised the scepter, he had no idea that it was a gesture to quiet the citizens and let them vote.

Unlike the podiums of later generations, which only faced one side of the audience. When suspicious eyes were cast at you from all sides, and you had nothing to rely on except standing, you can imagine how terrified you felt. No wonder later historians said that the power of the Greek city-states was actually in the hands of the elites, because if you were not well educated and had no special training, most people would be so nervous on stage that they couldn't even stretch their tongues straight, let alone give a speech.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hero had more than a thousand years of knowledge than others, and the psychological advantage he had formed was so strong that he quickly adapted to the environment and even smiled at Pionidos who was sitting in the council area.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Okay, Hero, you can ask Astouda now.\" Agesenos patted his shoulder to show encouragement.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro approached Astoda, and he felt a murderous aura in his eyes, but this did not scare him. Because Hiro realized that the one in front of him was a real Spartan warrior, and the scars on Astoda's face were proof of that, and his strong legs and powerful arms showed his strength. Therefore, Hiro's curiosity about him far outweighed his fear.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I apologize for the insulting words I said before about Spartan women!\" Shiloh's words caused an uproar among the audience. They were waiting to see a good show, but they didn't expect Shiloh to say such soft words as soon as he came on stage, which greatly disappointed them.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Astoda was stunned for a moment, then he found it funny.

Do Spartan women also abide by the code of conduct and remain faithful to their husbands like women in other city-states?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Good question!\" Someone in the audience began to cheer. Because, in Sparta, wives were not completely the property of their husbands. They could marry other men on the grounds of eugenics. In Sparta, brothers were allowed to share wives and to rob wives after marriage.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"This is the sacred tradition of our Sparta!

Some people didn't understand, so they asked someone and they also laughed. It turned out that hundreds of years ago, Sparta invaded its neighbor Messenia and wanted to turn the Messenians, who were once of the same race, into Sparta's slaves. The war (the First Messenian War) lasted for about twenty years. The Spartan soldiers could not go home for a long time, which led to the women who stayed at home having affairs with free men and slaves because of loneliness, and gave birth to a group of children. When the war was over and the soldiers returned home to know about this, many of these illegitimate children had grown into teenagers. The elders held an urgent meeting and finally decided to send them to colonize in the Greater Greece region to cover up the scandal. Finally, these children gained a foothold in southern Italy and established a city-state called Tarantum (today's Taranto).\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In fact, due to the intentional cover-up by the Spartan elders, many Spartans had not known about this for hundreds of years. However, Astoudas was not only a warrior, but also a messenger who had traveled to many places, so of course he had heard about this from others.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this moment, Astoda's bronze face turned red. He was about to refute, but Shiloh said:\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Actually, I have no intention of insulting Spartan women. On the contrary, I respect their spirit of pursuing independence!\" Shiloh punched his right chest with his fist to show respect. \"However, they need to be careful of a wolf now.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Wolf? Not only Astoda, but everyone else was also confused.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It is said that Alcibiades is with you and is regarded as a distinguished guest by your king.\" It is an open secret that Alcibiades defected to Sparta. When Hilo was reading history in his previous life, he did not like this man, thinking that he had no moral integrity and was extremely selfish. The reason why Sparta declared war this time was because it learned the details of Athens from Alcibiades, and it was under his instigation that it made up its mind to declare war on Athens. So Hilo decided to make things difficult for him: \"Who is Alcibiades? I'm afraid you don't know yet. He is a famous playboy in Athens, good at seducing young women with sweet words. If you don't believe it, you can ask Lord Agesenos.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although the Athenians hated Alcibiades at this time, it was not wise for Agosenos to slander his political enemy in public. He was about to change the subject when a man stood up from the audience and said, \"Yes, Alcibiades is such a person! Last time he tried to seduce my daughter, and I almost broke his leg!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"If I were you, I would just beat him to death!\" someone nearby said angrily, attracting the approval of a group of people.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"So when I heard that this wolf often went in and out of your king's residence, I was very worried about your king.\" Hero's words once again caused the whole audience to laugh. In fact, Alcibiades later fled Sparta because he cheated on the Spartan king.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Alcibiades first arrived in Sparta, he did cause a dispute between men and women, and Astoudas had heard about it. Moreover, Alcibiades had been living in the house of King Agis. After hearing what Hero said, Astoudas was indeed worried about it on the one hand, but he was also very angry on the other hand. He really regretted why he agreed to the request of this damn guy and suffered these insults. As for why Alcibiades was the leader of the wolf, he was too lazy to think about it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"You have finished asking questions.\" Astoudas suppressed his anger and said coldly, \"Agosenos, I am waiting for the response of your citizens' assembly to declare war on us! We Spartans will repay you tenfold for the hospitality you have received today.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"If Sparta defeats Athens, it will only lead to Sparta's death faster!\" Hero made a shocking statement.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

When Pericles was the chief general of Athens, he greatly improved the welfare of Athenian citizens on the one hand, and raised the threshold for becoming an Athenian citizen on the other hand.

His two sons with his first wife died one after another due to a plague that swept through Athens, and his son with Aspasia could not become an Athenian citizen because of the law he made. Seeing that his huge property had no one to inherit and he had no successor, Pericles cried bitterly at the citizens' assembly.

I was also surprised when I saw him take the stage. I was afraid that he would fight with the Spartans and cause a serious diplomatic incident.

In 489 BC, Miltiades was convicted and fined 50 talents. He died in prison because he could not pay. Cimon was out of control since he was young. He loved drinking and playing, and was called a \"fool\".

In 450 BC, Cimon led the Athenian navy to attack Cyprus and died on the way. Before his death, he ordered his subordinates to keep the news of his death secret and continue the attack. The Persians were afraid of Cimon's bravery and their morale was low, which eventually led to the Athenian army's complete victory at sea and on land.

However, Pericles was Amphilia's brother, and it would be good for Hero to please him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Of course, I think there should be someone to bring us young people together and do something meaningful to change other Athenians' impression of us!

Besides, he can't do anything about it. Amphilia is not an Athenian. When her mother was expelled from Athens, she took her to Miletus in Asia Minor.

Because of the war, Athens' trade has been severely affected! Because of the war, people have lost their land! Because of the war, the city is full of refugees, and the plague has been triggered twice! Because of the war, a city-state in the Aegean Sea sentenced Athens to the Tinian Alliance!

To be honest, he looked down on those who were influenced by the will of the citizens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Amfilia continued to stare at Shiloh, and her interest in this seemingly immature man grew stronger and stronger.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"How exactly could the Spartan army be defeated?\" she suddenly asked.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo was stunned and said subconsciously: \"You eavesdropped on our conversation.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"My brother's parties are not worth eavesdropping on.\" Anfilia's pretty face flushed slightly, revealing a look of contempt: \"It was just Uma who overheard it by accident.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Of course, Xi Luo would not believe her excuse. A woman was actually interested in the politics and military of the city-state! Was she influenced by her mother? If he was only attracted by Anfilia's beauty and temperament before, now he was more interested in her personality. The previous conversation had already made him accustomed to the tension of being with a beautiful woman, and now he was more like discussing a problem with a friend.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Sparta's soldiers were different from the armies of Athens and other city-states. They received arduous military training from childhood and could be said to be an army specialized in combat. They had stronger bodies, richer combat skills, and a better understanding of teamwork than others. Coupled with their unique 'left-hand strike' tactic, they were almost invincible in the Greek city-states.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What is a left-hand strike?\" Anfilia asked seriously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"The Spartans discovered very early that when the phalanx marched, the column would tilt to the right, causing the right wing to first contact the enemy's left wing. This was because the soldiers held a huge iron shield in their left hands to cover the right side of their neighbors, causing each soldier to unconsciously move far to the right. The Spartans took advantage of this feature and conducted special training. When the two sides met, a part of the well-trained soldiers on the right side of the Spartan phalanx would separate from the main force, march parallel to the enemy phalanx, and suddenly turn left to attack the rear of the enemy's left wing, resulting in the first advantage on this side.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anfilia thought about it carefully and asked, \"How do we break this tactic?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro shook his head. \"It's easy to break this tactic, but it's not easy to defeat Sparta. As I said before, the quality of Sparta's warriors is much higher than that of other city-states. Any strategy without strength as a foundation is just building a house on a pile of sand. Therefore, we must first improve the ability of our heavy infantry so that they can hold out for a period of time in a direct confrontation with Sparta, and then use cavalry or other assault arms to attack Sparta's flanks... This involves a problem of joint operations of multiple arms, which is not something Athens can do now!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Amphilia listened to Shiloh's endless narration, her beautiful blue eyes seemed to see through his strong body and into his heart: \"You want to be a tyrant?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro was surprised by Amphilia's sharpness. What she said was somewhat similar to what he wanted, but the word \"tyrant\" could not be said casually in Athens. Hiro hated himself for losing his caution under the beauty, and saw Amphilia's cunning smile, which was playful in her dignity. So he took advantage of the alcohol and said, \"No!

But even though my father loved my mother, even though he was a famous general in Athens, he still couldn't stop my mother from being expelled from Athens... When she left, my mother took a lot of wealth with her, but in Miletus, she was still... bullied...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anfilia recounted the past, and her heart became strong again: \"My mother once said, 'Beauty is a gem worth a thousand gold. If there is no sturdy box to hold it, it will only attract the greed of others!'\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh understood what she meant.

She wanted to say: Forget it, you don't have to waste your youth waiting for me. But seeing Shiloh's determined eyes, she walked forward, stretched out her hand, put her hand on Shiloh's chest, felt the strong heartbeat, and said: \"When that day comes, I don't need you to come, I will go find you!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When their eyes met, there was no need for too many words. Facing the beautiful face so close to him, Shiloh was tempted to hug her in his arms, but the voice of little Pericles sounded behind him: \"Hey, Shiloh, so you are here, everyone is waiting for you to drink the last round of wine!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh was still young and shy, so he quickly withdrew his hand, looked at Anfilia deeply again, and then left in a hurry.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Little Pericles stayed behind. Seeing his sister still staring at Hero's back, he smiled and said, \"Amphilia, what do you think of Hero?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anfilia plucked the strings lightly and said, \"A person completely different from you!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After a good sleep, Hilo had breakfast and went to the Port of Piraeus with Supete, Sesito and Hrim.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Hero family's properties were all in the port of Piraeus, including a large weapons workshop, a pottery workshop, a textile workshop, a bakery, and a warehouse for storing goods.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In fact, the most profitable thing was his fleet. In addition to purchasing food from the Black Sea, he also bought various materials from various city-states at low prices and sold them at high prices to make a profit from the difference.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Besides, the weapon workshop is also profitable. This is the traditional industry of the Shilo family. Although Shilo's grandfather did not know how to forge iron, the family has cultivated a large number of skilled slaves over decades of accumulation. Some are proficient in mold casting, some are proficient in forging, some are proficient in inlay (such as the connection between the spear head and the wooden pole, the iron sheet wrapped around the wooden shield...), and some are proficient in decoration before completion.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh saw this, he was extremely shocked: Isn’t this the primitive assembly line operation!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Later, he learned that many large workshops were also like this. This was because large workshops were operated by more than ten slaves, and the masters certainly did not want the slaves to master the core technology, so they divided it into several parts so that they could only master a part of it, and also for the convenience of management.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      To Shiloh, the fleet was not as important as the weapons workshop. Every slave in the workshop was a rare talent. Even though he did not know how to forge weapons, he still braved the scorching heat and listened carefully to the manager's explanation while watching the process of each step. Then, in front of all the slaves, he warned the manager of the weapons workshop: \"In the future, you must not deduct their food and you must not let them overwork...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the workshop, Hiro also met Cecile's son, Conda. This honest young man did not inherit his father's fighting skills (that was because he was separated from his father Cecile for a long time after becoming a slave), but instead had superb forging skills. Hiro was of course very encouraging!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Finally, with the slaves' gratitude, he left the weapons workshop and soon entered the bakery.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The bakery of Hero's family consists of three parts: a mill, a baking house and a bakery. In addition to being self-sufficient, it also earns a lot of money for the family. Because Hero's family has sufficient flour sources and good quality, the bread they sell is cheap and good. If it weren't for the interference of the Athenian Merchants Association, the price war alone would have squeezed out many of their peers. But now it's no longer possible. Due to the war, the number of refugees in the city has increased, and they are short of food and clothing. As a wealthy citizen of Athens, Hero responded to the call of the council and it was his duty to provide relief to the poor. Therefore, in addition to using the bread for himself, most of the bread he produced was given free of charge to the refugees queuing outside the store.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh carefully watched the process in the bakery, and was still wondering whether to develop steamed buns, dumplings, and noodles (steamed buns and bread only have different production processes, but the raw materials are basically the same, flour and yeast). After the visit, he once again expressed his concern for the welfare of the slaves, and then asked his followers to take some bread away.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the northeast corner of the port is the pottery making area. The pottery workshop of Helo's family is very inconspicuous. In fact, it does not make money. It was first built by Helo's great-grandfather. It turns out that although he is good at managing weapons, he is a complete layman in pottery. In addition, the pottery manufacturing industry in Athens has long been developed, so the pottery made by Helo's family can't be sold except for self-use. However, this persistent great-grandfather is unwilling to close the workshop. It was not until Helo's grandfather took over that he sold some unique pottery purchased from other city-states in the workshop, and the business started to improve slightly. Later, it also made red bricks for the family...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      But Shiloh attached great importance to the pottery workshop, because he knew that if the colonization was really to take place, the pottery workshop and the weapon workshop would play an important role in building an independent city, so he asked about the work of the workshop in detail and solemnly promised to improve the working environment and conditions of the workshop, which excited the director of the pottery workshop who had been neglected for a long time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The textile workshop of Hero's family was a complete self-production and self-sale. Because the Greeks were not like the Egyptians who knew how to dress up, nor like the Persians who loved luxury, they lived a simple life, and a piece of linen cloth was made into clothes. Every Greek housewife knew how to weave linen, shear wool, and make wool when she was young. Weaving became her main task after marriage, so the excess cloth was not only unpopular when put on the market, but also had very little profit.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if the slaves were dressed simply, the consumption of fabrics was still a large number. Therefore, there were a total of 38 female slaves in the textile workshop. They not only wove cloth, but also accompanied guests during banquets at the Shiloh family and served as sexual tools when the master had strong desires. Male slaves could not approach them casually. Only when the master gave him a female slave and allowed him to marry in order to reward him, then the children they had in the future would be \"house-born slaves\". Supete was a \"house-born slave\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh walked into the workshop, he saw Alesha in the yard at a glance. This beautiful slave girl was shearing wool alone. A dozen docile sheep surrounded her. She was covered with white wool all over her body, and she looked funny and cute.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When she saw Shiloh coming in, she was startled and subconsciously wanted to bury her head in the flock of sheep, but then she saw her father and immediately stood up. However, she did not dare to go up and talk to Cecito. She could only stand there and look at her father pitifully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh looked at the silent Cecito and was about to speak. The supervisor Nima had heard the news and came out. Shiloh asked her, \"Why do I see Alesha shearing sheep alone?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Master, Alesha contacted a man without your permission.

In fact, he was glad to have such a supervisor who strictly enforced the rules and regulations, even though the rules were unreasonable: \"You did the right thing!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After Xi Luo finished speaking, he walked in, but Nima stopped the people behind him: \"Others must wait outside the door!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh finished his inspection and returned to the yard, he saw Alesha still standing there alone, staring at the door motionlessly. Shiloh's heart moved and he said, \"I'm short of a servant recently, so let Alesha come over!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Nima hesitated for a moment, then bowed and replied, \"Yes, Master!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Alesha, pack your things and follow the master!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After hearing this, Alesha couldn't help but cheer and ran towards the workshop.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Master, Alesha is still a child and doesn't understand many things!\" Nima hurriedly reported to Shiloh.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh smiled. In fact, he found it funny that Alesha still remained lively and innocent, because most of the female and male slaves he saw in the workshop were dazed and lacked vitality.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Supate!\" Shiloh shouted, \"Come in and see your mother!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Just now, Nima saw her son, but she had to suppress this strong mother-son affection and pretend to be a stranger. Unexpectedly, Xi Luo was so considerate that she was almost choked with excitement: \"Thank you, Master!

Shiloh was a little confused. In fact, he didn't know that the origin of roses representing love came from ancient Greece: It is said that the goddess of love Aphrodite drove to see her sweetheart, just to give him a glass of pure wine. When getting off the car, she accidentally stepped on a thorny bush, and the blood and spilled wine poured onto the plant, which gave rise to bright and beautiful roses... So roses are the embodiment of love and blood, representing the meaning of disregarding life for love.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Are roses for sale in Athens?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Alesha asked curiously, \"Can roses still be sold for money?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh was speechless.

In revenge, Eros shot Apollo with a golden arrow and shot the fairy Daphne with a lead arrow. This made Apollo fall in love with Daphne, while Daphne avoided him. Under Apollo's close pursuit, Daphne could no longer hide and was helplessly transformed into a laurel tree. Apollo was in great pain and decided to give her glory in order to commemorate her. Since he was also the god in charge of literature and sports, he stipulated that the winner would be given a hat made of laurel leaves as the highest reward, which is the origin of the \"laurel wreath\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      I seem to have a little unrequited love for Amphelia.

Shiloh couldn't help but sigh in his heart. In fact, he didn't know that the Hebrews were not born to make money. It was just that in 2000 BC, they occupied Canaan, which was the middle area between Babylon and Egypt. It was an ideal place for the two major powers to interact, trade, and have markets, so the Hebrews got used to doing business very early.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Maybe I should wait and see, and not rush to replace this financial manager, Shiloh thought to himself.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the afternoon, Shiloh, along with Sesito, Herim, Supete and Keniga, set foot on the Avenue of Athena of All Spirits.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Entering the Agora Market, he found that there was another large group of people gathered around the council announcement desk, so he walked over curiously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"The Isthmian Games are about to begin, and Corinth has sent an invitation to Athens.

In addition, with Sesito's explanation, they did not resist too much, but this also made Xiluo determined to build his own strength as soon as possible.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Master, they asked you what to do with their children?\" Cecito came over to ask Shiloh.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"They speak Greek?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Cecito shook his head, pointed at a tall man in the crowd, and said, \"Only Anchial'o knows a little bit! He is the leader among them! I was the one who told them what you said before, Master!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro walked straight to Anchialo, this big man who was taller than Hiro. Although he was now just a skeleton, Hiro could still feel the indomitable fighting spirit from his vigilant eyes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I will teach them how to read, read books, and learn how to fight...\" Shiloh said one sentence and Cecito translated it. When he finished speaking, everyone was stunned.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although the Thracians were barbaric, it did not mean that they did not yearn for civilization. Their enemy, Macedonia, often invaded them because they had sharper weapons and stronger equipment... But the Macedonians, who were already very powerful in their eyes, were still barbarians in the eyes of the Greeks! And Athens was the most prosperous and powerful country among the Greek city-states!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Through Cecito's translation, the crowd exclaimed. They were eager for knowledge, but they didn't expect that there was such a person who didn't want the little slaves to work, but wanted to teach them knowledge? ! How could such a good thing be possible? !\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anchial'o's dry lips uttered a trembling voice: \"...Really?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Of course! I will find a teacher for them this afternoon, and I will probably be able to teach them formally tomorrow!\" Xilo faced Anchialo calmly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
