The nobles who originally had little confidence in the Near East development plan could not help but increase their investment when they saw the civil war breaking out in the Orc Empire.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     For a time, Crescent Port became more and more prosperous, with ships coming in and out in an endless stream every day.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Although the transit tax was exempted, the large number of people still brought countless wealth to Xueyue Territory. Other places still lost money, but Xinyue Port achieved a balance between income and expenditure.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Excluding the monopoly transactions under the Ministry of Commerce, daily business taxes and rents alone cover the administrative costs and even generate a surplus.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This is undoubtedly a good start. This year's shop rents are all symbolic. With the current flow of people, it would be unfair to not increase the rental income next year.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     As time goes by and the Near East region is further developed, the passenger flow of Crescent Harbor will continue to increase.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     By then, commercial taxes and rental income will increase accordingly, and will have the ability to feed back to the territory.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The good news is not just that. With the rise of the Orc Empire, the smuggling trade has become more prosperous.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The prices of all commodities that are related to war are constantly rising. Basically, the orcs will buy as much as the smugglers have.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If there is not enough cash to pay, then slaves and livestock will be used to pay off the debt. Since the war started, the number of livestock and slaves pouring into Xueyue Territory has skyrocketed fivefold.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The sequelae of the sharp increase in quantity is that prices have dropped rapidly. If it weren't for the Lord's Mansion's open purchase at a guaranteed price, the market would have been ruined.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Looking at boatload after boatload of slaves, Hudson strongly suspected that the orcs were packing up the tribe and selling it to him.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Originally, only some weak races would become slaves, but now it has expanded. Including the four royal families, almost all the orc races can be found in Crescent Harbor.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The slave traders are all smart people and know what their customers need. After the slaves are delivered to Crescent Harbor, they are first screened and classified.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The high-quality slaves were sold to nobles, entertainment venues, and arenas, and the rest were packaged and sold to Master Hudson.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     As for hard labor, as long as the price is cheap and you have some strength, that's enough. There's no need to ask for anything else.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Generally speaking, the more attractive the slave is, the higher the transaction price will be.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The only exception is the orc royal family. No matter how good-looking they are, this identity alone makes their worth doubled.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The most typical example is the Behemoth clan. When they were once the royal family, the starting salary of any Behemoth was three digits, but now it has dropped to double digits.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Hudson didn't have time to care about these things. He just had to pay taxes to him properly. If it weren't for the contributions of the smugglers, Crescent Harbor would not have been able to make a profit so quickly.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The influx of orc slaves filled the labor shortage in Snow Moon Territory. Many planned infrastructure projects were put on schedule in advance.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The original plan of gaining a firm foothold in the first five years and then seeking development has obviously failed to keep up with the changes in the situation, and a systematic adjustment must be made.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The main reason was the internal fighting among the orcs. Hudson just came up with an idea, and the subsequent things were all caused by the orcs themselves.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     It was because the conflicts accumulated in the past were too deep. The orcs had suffered from the rule of the royal family for a long time, and the royal family was too arrogant. The problems that could have been solved by political means eventually turned into armed conflicts.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Although both sides tried to suppress the situation and a full-scale civil war did not break out, local conflicts never stopped. If it weren't for the fierce internal fighting among the orcs, the Snow Moon Territory would not have received so many slaves.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"google-auto-placed ap_container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <ins class=\"adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1074058122108724\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;\">\n    <div id=\"aswift_2_host\" style=\"border: none; height: 0px; width: 739px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;\">\n     <iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!3\" data-google-query-id=\"CLvszpWvkIcDFbErVQgdomkGLA\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_2\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_2\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=1&amp;gdpr_consent=CQBSCsAQBSCsAEsACBENA7EoAP_gAEPgACY4INJB7C7FbSFCwH5zaLsAMAhHRsAAQoQAAASBAmABQAKQIAQCgkAQFASgBAACAAAAICZBIQIECAAACUAAQAAAAAAEAAAAAAAIIAAAgAEAAAAIAAACAAAAEAAIAAAAEAAAmAgAAIIACAAAhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQOhQD2F2K2kKFkPCmQWYAQBCijYAAhQAAAAkCBIAAgAUgQAgFIIAgAIFAAAAAAAAAQEgCQAAQABAAAIACgAAAAAAIAAAAAAAQQAABAAIAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAQAAAAIAABEhCAAQQAEAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAABAAA&amp;addtl_consent=2~70.89.93.108.122.149.196.236.259.311.313.323.358.415.449.486.494.495.540.574.609.827.864.981.1029.1048.1051.1095.1097.1126.1205.1211.1276.1301.1365.1415.1423.1449.1514.1570.1577.1598.1651.1716.1735.1753.1765.1870.1878.1889.1958.2072.2253.2299.2357.2373.2415.2506.2526.2568.2571.2575.2624.2677~dv.&amp;client=ca-pub-1074058122108724&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2358201839&amp;adf=826460285&amp;pi=t.aa~a.1781892510~i.49~rp.4&amp;w=739&amp;abgtt=3&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1687622468&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=1595115097&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=739x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.uuks.org%2Fb%2F57664%2F72080500.html&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=185&amp;rw=739&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiIiwiIiwiIiwiIixudWxsLDAsbnVsbCwiIixbWyJOb3QvQSlCcmFuZCIsIjguMC4wLjAiXSxbIkNocm9taXVtIiwiIl0sWyJIZWFkbGVzc0Nocm9tZSIsIiJdXSwwXQ..&amp;dt=1720198604951&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=364&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20240702&amp;mjsv=m202406270101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D50ef8d8d00d09011%3AT%3D1720198602%3ART%3D1720198602%3AS%3DALNI_MabSD0hLISWsNMzIhdLhVCzplHX2w&amp;gpic=UID%3D00000e74c6496d6b%3AT%3D1720198602%3ART%3D1720198602%3AS%3DALNI_MYUoxN6SaWwD26MdjBGdibAfI2sZQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc74753b3ea0aea65%3AT%3D1720198602%3ART%3D1720198602%3AS%3DAA-AfjZK499A3jvdSguN50bK0HyI&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C779x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=6701730943893&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=731143721.1720198605&amp;ga_sid=1720198605&amp;ga_hid=1121157896&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=120&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_h=600&amp;u_w=800&amp;u_ah=600&amp;u_aw=800&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=20&amp;ady=2139&amp;biw=779&amp;bih=600&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44759837%2C95334511%2C95334529%2C95334564%2C95334828%2C31084927%2C31084679%2C31078663%2C31078668%2C31078670&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=500738340843408&amp;tmod=267089534&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C800%2C0%2C800%2C600%2C800%2C600&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;psd=W251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLDNd&amp;nt=1&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=4\" style=\"left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 739px; height: 0px;\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"739\">\n     </iframe>\n    </div>\n   </ins>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Not only Hudson was using a large number of orc slaves, but the nobles in the Near East were also following suit. Even some lords in the northern border area who were short of population joined in the fun.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     According to statistics from the tax department, the total number of orc slaves sold to the kingdom has reached nearly 180,000, half of which remained in the Snow Moon Territory.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This is just a statistical figure, the actual number is much higher. After all, slave trade also requires taxation, no matter how low the tax rate is, it still costs money.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Hudson was not naive enough to think that these unscrupulous slave traders would honestly pay taxes in full.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There was no further investigation because what they were doing was still within the tolerance range. Snow Moon Territory needed more orc slaves to do hard labor, and their enthusiasm could not be dampened.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Huge profits are the driving force. Every time a slave is brought back, the kingdom gains a labor force and the Orc Empire is weakened.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     With one increase and one decrease, that's double the happiness. The strategic materials sold over there are not wasted, they will all be consumed in the internal fighting of the orcs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If Hudson had not been worried about interfering too much and leaving clues, which would arouse the orcs' vigilance, he would have wanted to take action himself to provoke a conflict.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In fact, similar actions have already existed. When Bear Stearns went out for a walk, he would often hang orcs of different races on each other's flagpoles.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Many of the races that already have conflicts are too lazy to even conduct investigations and just start fighting.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This situation continued until the two camps confronted each other, and then it slowly stopped. It is easier to fish in turbulent waters, but it is not suitable to make too many moves when the situation is clear.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If the orcs discovered the problem, it would be troublesome. Hudson didn't want to become their common enemy and ease the internal strife in the Orc Empire.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The change in the situation directly affected the judgment of all parties. The price was that the cash flow of the Near East Development Bank was getting smaller and smaller. In order to make up for the bank's liquidity, Hudson had injected capital several times.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Not only did he lose his own vault, but he also scammed out the vaults of Bear Stearns and Maxim.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Unlike other customers' savings, Maxim and Bear Stearns' money was charged interest, and the interest rate was the same as the bank's external lending standard.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Despite such strenuous efforts to attract deposits, the total amount of currency in the vault of the Near East Development Bank is only about 4 million gold coins, while the loans issued have reached more than 18 million.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Having seen the high leverage ratio in his previous life, Hudson could accept it, but Rudolph, the bank president, was almost scared to tears.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     With such a huge financial leverage, if something goes wrong, no one may be able to do anything to Hudson, but he, as a bank manager, will definitely die a miserable death.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The reason why so much cash can be retained is not only due to leverage, but also due to the issuance of gold notes.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In the face of the cash crisis, Hudson used the time-limited gold notes from the Near Eastern Development Bank to keep making purchases in the southeastern provinces.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Although the nobles had no love for gold notes, they found it more convenient than bartering, and with Hudson's reputation as a guarantee, everyone could reluctantly accept it.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     After buying, it's all about selling, selling, selling\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     After delivering the goods to those who needed them, a large amount of gold notes flowed back into Hudson's hands.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There was no taking advantage of the situation; all the money earned was hard-earned.

The conservative nobles simply did not believe that a piece of paper could replace currency.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Even with the endorsement of a strong figure like Hudson, the nobles in their own nest could only be skeptical, let alone expanding to the outside world.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The first step is always the hardest.

In order to save money, they had to pay for the maintenance of the official residence themselves.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Fortunately, the kingdom's top leaders do not live on salaries, otherwise the little money the government gives out would not even be enough to cover the daily maintenance costs of the mansions.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Of course, this does not mean that the salaries of officials in the Alpha Kingdom are low, nor that the government is corrupt and incompetent; it is just that the kingdom's finances are scarce after the war, and it is temporarily unable to pay salaries and cannot afford the maintenance costs of official residences.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Low-level bureaucrats had to support their families, and no one dared to touch their salaries, so they could only owe them to higher-ups. A number of high-ranking officials in the kingdom, including King Caesar IV, were creditors of the Ministry of Finance.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This debt became a habit, and Hudson had never received a full salary from the time he became the Royal Marshal until now, except during wartime.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Under normal circumstances, the royal government needs to pay Hudson 30,000 gold coins every year, including annual salary + various subsidies + residence maintenance costs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The reality is that Hudson can only receive 300 gold coins from the royal government every year, and the actual issuance ratio is exactly 1%, which makes him not know how to complain.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There is no doubt that this is a standard number that has been accurately calculated by the Ministry of Finance.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This amount is just enough to cover the cost of supporting a bureaucrat's family and maintaining a decent life for the lower-class nobles. As long as no major changes occur, under normal circumstances, there will be a surplus of 180 gold coins every year.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Officials whose annual income was above this figure had their salaries withheld by the royal government for various reasons, while those whose income was below this figure were paid in full.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Including the king's annuity, only this much can be received each year, and the remaining hundreds of thousands are debts.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     It's an old tradition.

The fox girl turned into an elf, and the traces of the big forces manipulating behind the scenes became more obvious.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     With this incident, I guess the Moshi government no longer has the heart to continue holding the auction.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     We would like to ask you to help us make some connections and trade some potions and alchemical items with the Moshi people privately.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If possible, please help smooth things over so that we can visit Master Kemboyin's laboratory.\"\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Hudson was shocked after hearing the first half of Robert's analysis.

The defense of the Near East could not be without a leader. Once Hudson led his troops south, he would have to step down as the commander-in-chief of the front.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Compared with the position of commander on the front line, helping the Kingdom of Hessen to suppress the rebellion this time is really too low-profile.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The most core issue is still: military power!\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     As the supreme commander on the Near East front, Hudson commanded the kingdom's most elite border troops and the private armies of the nobles in the seven provinces of the Near East. During wartime, he was also able to control the private armies of the nobles in the twelve provinces in the northern border.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In the Near East, the power was unimaginable. The fact that Hudson had to be invited to every important meeting of the kingdom was enough to illustrate the problem.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In comparison, the expeditionary force to the Kingdom of Hesse was of a much lower standard. Not only was the total force limited to 80,000, but the three standing armies sent were also second-line legions.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In non-wartime, this second-line army is usually not fully staffed, usually ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 people. The number of troops depends entirely on which army corps are drawn.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The rest were all private armies of the nobles. Although their combat effectiveness had been greatly improved after so many years of training, they were still not as good as the regular army.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Of course, the military instructors sent to the Kingdom of Hesse all believed that the combat effectiveness of the private army of the kingdom's nobles could catch up with the level of the regular army of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There is no doubt that this evaluation is biased. Although they are all private armies of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, the difference in combat effectiveness among them is greater than the difference between humans and dogs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If it were Hudson's own private army, this evaluation would definitely be a bit conservative.
