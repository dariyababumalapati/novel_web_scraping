The threat of the old neighbors, the Stone People, has not been eliminated, and now a powerful enemy has been added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only easy one is probably the Count Louis Vuitton. Misfortunes and blessings, the Hessians had annexed the counties of Korubia before, but now they are such a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expansion of the territory made the Kingdom of Hesse the first among the three countries in the mainland to face off against the army of elves, a proper dungeon of hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gratitude does not exist. It's not that he asked the Hessians to help block the knife, and if he didn't do anything to delay his progress, he was just taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is not a direct descendant of the kingdom, and he was able to have a position in the high-level meeting because Alexander V took into account the international influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much sense of presence, and Earl Louis Vuitton is also happy to paddle. Feel free to toss around, anyway, not long ago he was transferred again, from a wealthy county to a remote mountain county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The backcountry also has the benefits of the backcountry. Even if an army of foreign races comes over, it won't be his turn for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Kingdom of Alpha and the Principality of Moxi refused to send troops together. What's going on? Don't they have any strategic awareness?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked with a puzzled expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open the map and you will know that once the Kingdom of Hesse retreats, the Kingdom of Alpha and the Principality of Moxi will be surrounded on three sides by the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little common sense knows that under such a comprehensive and passive strategic structure, the two countries may be in danger of being destroyed at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, according to the information from the north, the orc army just won a big victory, and the Alpha Kingdom was forced to abandon many provinces in the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deal with the orc invasion, they have concentrated their forces to the northern border, and they are really powerless against the elves' invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality of Moxi borders too many areas with foreign races, and the reluctance to send troops is probably because they are afraid of getting burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in recent years, they have been strategically following the Alpha Kingdom. Not long ago, the Alliance of the Ancient Remains invaded, and the Alphas helped them solve it. It is not surprising that the two countries continue to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it does not rule out that the two countries and the elves have reached an agreement in secret. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Marquis Krasner explained in a difficult way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that their Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't work hard, it's that the reasons for their refusal to send troops are too strong, and there is no room for exerting pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs has invaded the country. They have to protect themselves first, and there is no fault at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the current passive situation is also caused by themselves. If they had supported the Northern Continent at the beginning of the war, the situation would never have collapsed so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that they are not the only country on the mainland. If you only contribute your own efforts and others look at it, everyone will feel unbalanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impression of the elves paddling is too deep. Everyone is lucky, thinking that they can end the war before the elves intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this mentality, when the countries in the Northern Continent asked for help, the three major kingdoms in the Central Continent chose to wait and see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wait-and-see will cause a big problem. When they realize that the situation is wrong, it will be too late to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expected meat shield Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi did not play their due role, and they did not fight the elf army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is suspected that they have reached an agreement secretly, if there is no evidence, it will only bring shame upon the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Alpha Kingdom has always been on the front line in the fight against alien races, and its contribution to the human race is obvious to all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, the two of them can't divide their forces, so it's fine if they don't send troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hastened to contact the countries in the central continent, especially the Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Bank, and must form a coalition army in the central mainland in the shortest possible time to prevent the army of elves from going south! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be an understatement, but in fact his heart is not peaceful at all. Without the participation of the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi, it is not only a reduction in military strength, but also a comprehensive passive strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to their original strategic deduction, the elf army should destroy the Principality of Moxie, and severely damage the Kingdom of Alpha before going south to avoid threats to the flanks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not known whether the three parties have reached an agreement, anyway, the elf army went directly south, as if not worried about the threat to the flanks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let's ask the Alliance for help!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Coast are similar to our situation. They are all busy with their own wars, and the troops they can deploy are limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the small countries are all vassals of our three countries, and their strength is very limited. Even if they form a large army, it may be difficult to stop the elf army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nicholas suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he is too familiar with the military strength of the Central Continent. There has been no major war for many years, and the army has long been unfamiliar. Now they are all trainees on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the outbreak of the war to the present, all kinds of messy things have emerged one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kong has national power, but because of the low efficiency of the government and the poor coordination of all aspects, it is unable to exert its full strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each of them led their younger brothers to work, and they were all chicken feathers from the same place. After forming a coalition, there were more troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is that everyone grew up in the war. If the army of elves came later, the situation would be completely different when the generals of all countries had grown up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Nicholas, your thinking is too simple. If it is effective to ask the alliance for help, the elf army will not be able to reach our doorstep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries in the northern continent have long asked for help from the alliance. No matter how tight the battle situation is, they will not be completely unable to mobilize their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the declining Kingdom of Oprus, Avalat, and Ruthenia, we, the Kingdom of Dante, and the Kingdom of the South Shore will each deploy seven or eight main armies. It will not be difficult to reinforce the North Continent, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Iberia is stronger than us. Since the outbreak of the war, it has suppressed the alien race. It is not a problem to deploy a dozen or so main armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom, which are more powerful, have never felt the pressure, and they can easily do it by deploying 20 legions each.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Collection of other small countries, the entire Human Race Alliance can send millions of troops to the North Continent at the beginning of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, because of their own interests, everyone made excuses to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more clear the situation is now, the less likely the major powers in the Southern Continent will send troops. Asking them for help is meaningless except to humiliate yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already contacted them, and everyone guessed the final result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is talking about reinforcements, but when it comes to specific actions, they just want to annex the surrounding alien races as soon as possible and strengthen their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are wishing that we and the alien army will lose both. Anyway, the war will not end for a while, and they can finish their own work and come out to clean up the mess! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Marquis Krasner's mocking words, everyone looked embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the countries in the Northern Continent asked for help, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocated sending troops, but it was rejected by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the theory of cold lips and teeth is really effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no big country leading the reinforcements, the situation in the North Continent quickly collapsed, and the Kingdom of Hesse was forced to take up the banner of resisting the invasion of the elf army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames of war have reached my own home, and I can no longer hide. Regardless of the final outcome of the war, the strategic plan of the Kingdom of Hesse went bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar scene happened at the same time in the Kingdom of the South Bank and the Kingdom of Dante. With the pain of the skin, you can understand the pain of being betrayed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain leader, after glancing at the information in his hand, Hudson shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This continental war has buried more than a dozen countries. However, this is just the beginning. If nothing else happens, more countries will be destroyed in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing unexpected happens, there will be a big reshuffle within the Terran world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former top ten kingdoms in the mainland, the Warhammer Kingdom has become history. Even if the country can be restored after the war, it will not change the fate of decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Oprus, the Kingdom of Avalat, and the Kingdom of Ruthenia, which performed poorly in the war, have now clearly fallen behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a big country goes down, it's best to hope that its neighbors go down with it. Just judging from the current situation, this seems to be a luxury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Three Kingdoms cannot stand up, they will inevitably be swallowed up and divided after the war. As for the length of this time period, it depends on everyone's integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the future fate of the Three Kingdoms is directly proportional to the speed at which the moral system collapses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these three countries with internal problems, the Alpha Kingdom and the Three Kingdoms of the Central Continent are also being tested, and their future fate depends entirely on the follow-up wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a moment Hudson felt the pressure. In the face of the great era, personal power is too fragile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the Mountain Land Territory is still a force in the eyes of the Alpha Kingdom. But if you look at the entire continent, you won't be ranked at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What troubled him the most was that someone was robbing him of refugees. Such a move is completely interrupting the development process of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously knows who the other party is, but he still can't do anything. Compared with the most powerful country in the mainland, the chips in his hands are really too few.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed down, let the people of the immigration agency take the initiative to attack, and can't sit there and wait for the refugees to come to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't focus on the North Continent, the flames of war are about to reach the Central Continent, and our old neighbors will soon be in trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrange people there, wait for the Hesse Kingdom to fall into war, and then wait for the opportunity to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care how to do it, I want to get him back anyway. Remember to be quiet, and don't hang my banner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, you can spend money to buy mercenaries and slave trade organizations. If something happens, let them take the blame. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is changing too fast, and it is impossible not to take risks. For the sake of territorial development, he couldn't care less about offending the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are already in a vortex, and the losses in the next war will definitely not be small. Even if he found out about his little tricks after the war, he probably didn't have time to worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, their relationship with the kingdom has deteriorated long ago. Even if it is a diplomatic protest, the kingdom will probably ignore it. As long as you can save face, that's fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arranging the affairs of the territory, Hudson went straight to the capital without stopping. It is not easy to be a commander-in-chief during a war, even if you want to take a vacation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After staying in the territory for less than two days, he was urged by the kingdom to go back to handle military affairs. It was all caused by the unfavorable frontline warfare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the strategic contraction plan was proposed by him in order to preserve the strength of the kingdom, all parties still cannot tolerate the loss of cities and territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Marquis James took the trouble alone, and the Kingdom did not announce that it was giving up voluntarily, otherwise Hudson would be scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The public opinion environment in the kingdom is like this, as long as the front line loses the city and land, it is a heinous crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be fine if there was a huge disparity in strength between the two sides. The nobles had more or less knowledge and could understand what was unavoidable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is not much difference in strength between the two sides. Because of the command error, everyone can't stand the defeat all the way on the front line!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to be a good person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic contraction was mainly to keep the noble lords in the north. It turned out that the nobles in the border area of ​​northern Xinjiang happened to be the most troublesome now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also understands their feelings, whoever loves their territory. It took a lot of effort to get a little improvement in business, and now I must give up suddenly, I must be reluctant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, if the supply of strategic materials is not available, the battle cannot be fought at all. Either take the initiative to shrink strategically now, or be forced to retreat when the strategic supplies are exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the aristocratic lords in the border area were making trouble, and then the five northern dukes took over and gradually became the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum it up in one sentence, the flames of war are at the door of the house, and one's own core is damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis is having a hard time. Facing the pressure of public opinion coming to his face, he couldn't stand it anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even without Hudson as a substitute, it is only a matter of time before he is ousted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of aristocratic lords have already requested the kingdom to change their commanders. This kind of thing is very rare in the more than 300-year history of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom couldn't withstand the pressure, so naturally it couldn't let Hudson idle. Even if the expeditionary legion is in a rest period, he has to take over the position of commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The frontlines continue to suffer setbacks, and now the morale of the army has been severely damaged. The most urgent task is to restore confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not enough to just change the coach, we must also send reinforcements to boost everyone's confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deploy five standing legions, and then recruit five legions from provinces that have not yet been mobilized, forming an army of 100,000 and rushing to the front. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the Royal Capital Meeting, Hudson made a direct request.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of guarding against the army of elves, not all the standing army of the kingdom was sent to the battlefield in the northern border, and the provinces in the southwestern region did not recruit troops to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the contract is signed, the threat of the elves can be ignored for the time being, and the kingdom can also deal with the northern battlefield freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The troops on the front line have been seriously damaged, and it is necessary to deploy reinforcements. It's just that the Marshal sent 100,000 troops, isn't it a little short?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, recruit ten more legions to gather 200,000 troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the front line was tense. During the retreat, they suffered several defeats and lost a lot of troops. The 100,000 troops only made up for the losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wish readers a happy May Day, and luckily caught up.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With a dragon chant, everyone knows that the only marshal of the kingdom has arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson has not had time to do anything, but because of his arrival, the morale of the frontline officers and soldiers has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally lifeless headquarters suddenly became full of hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom finally changed coaches, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief, including Marquis James himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Retiring now is nothing more than bearing the infamy of incompetence and returning to the field. If you suffer a few more defeats, then you can't even think about retreating unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, his command is quite satisfactory. There are no major highlights, and there are not many omissions. The overall performance is still passing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can stand out from the crowd of generals, the ability of Marquis James is beyond doubt. To be able to get to the current position, that is also from the battlefield with a knife and a shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe his performance is not the most amazing, but James' luck is better than that of his contemporaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those competitors who performed better than him in the past died on the battlefield one by one, and he became the leader of the army after suffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the last war, when he assisted Hudson in commanding the army, he also performed very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it was misplaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James, who is more than stable but not flexible enough, is an excellent executor, but the commander-in-chief is very average.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is equipped with a staff department to make up for the shortcomings in flexibility, it can also become an excellent commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a staff department in the continent of Aslant. Hudson's military reforms also remained on the surface and did not touch the deeper command system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't want to do it, but that under the current conditions of the kingdom, there is no condition for reforming the command system at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone can be a staff officer. Even Hudson himself can barely assemble an immature team. How can it be promoted in the entire army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to become a qualified staff officer, the first thing you need to do is to emancipate your mind and abandon the shackles of traditional military thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The solidification of thought is the most important ruling core under the current political system. After years of brainwashing, there are very few people who can not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone is deeply influenced by traditional ideas, those who are not affected become heresies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This situation is more serious in countries with fewer wars. Especially in the civil war among human aristocrats, whoever does not follow the rules will be rejected by the entire circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is more pragmatic, but not open enough to subvert the feudal system. In such a big environment, Hudson can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the words came to his lips, James swallowed them back again. It's too late to say anything now, someone needs to take responsibility for losing a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't be the king who pushed him to the throne, so he has to carry it himself. Anyway, it was not wronged, the defeat on the battlefield itself was a mistake in his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't say any more, go back and rest for a while, your current mental state is very wrong.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in appeasement. At this point in the matter, whether James can make a comeback depends mainly on whether Caesar IV is still willing to trust him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the unlucky guy who didn't grow up like Jose, Marquis James, who climbed to the top of the military, couldn't be wooed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To have the current status, the royal family treats him well. If this can still change jobs, not only Caesar IV will kill him, but other forces will not dare to reuse this kind of person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has no value, so naturally there is no need to retain it. Anyway, there isn't much friendship between the two of them, it's enough to save face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After checking the message and confirming that there was no problem, the two quickly completed the transfer of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After watching Marquis James leave, Hudson immediately called the main frontline generals and held a military meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no change in the strategic deployment, the main one is \"stable\". After suffering a loss, the defense level of all places has been improved, and it is purely dreamy to want to attack the city again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, shrinking the Alpha Kingdom's strategy is a big failure in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the battlefield is in the newly recovered provinces of northern Xinjiang, the orc cavalry can gallop freely, as long as they don't go too deep and get bitten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the battle line shrinks, what they are facing is densely packed fortresses. Ten miles to a castle, fifty miles to a fortress, that is not an exaggeration at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the cavalry goes deep, it will be difficult to play a role in the face of this defensive network. As soon as he crossed the border, his tracks were exposed, and the sneak attack was purely a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is not a soft persimmon, the orc cavalry who have exposed their traces are sending achievements to the Kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While stabilizing the front line, while waiting for reinforcements to arrive, Hudson did not panic at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no one urged him to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV can dictate to Marquis James because he was promoted by the royal family, which is different from a commander who was born as a prince like Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the defenders don't panic, it's the attacking side's turn to have a headache. Facing the defenders with the word \"steady\" in the foreground, the orc army began to worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of an expedition involving teachers, if you can't take advantage of it, you will suffer a disadvantage. After several tentative attacks, the battlefield unexpectedly entered a state of confrontation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army did not launch an attack, and the defenders huddled in the city, and the two sides started a game of staring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This confrontation lasted for more than a month. The defenders in the city are fine, the orc army stationed in the wild can't bear it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs themselves are not a hygienic race. They eat, drink and scatter in one place, and the camp is smoky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel wanted to rectify several times, but was forced to stop because of too much internal opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Daniel, the current situation is completely different from what you said before. Not to mention the heavy damage to the enemy, now we can't even touch the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's reinforcements are about to arrive, and the situation we face will be even worse by then, and it may be difficult to attack again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said impatiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current battle situation is still acceptable to him. It's just that not fighting for a long time, and being so exhausted all the time, is also a heavy pressure on the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logistical problems not only plagued the Alpha Kingdom, but also plagued the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle, there are still corpses from both sides that can be used as supplies, and when you are free, you can rely solely on the rear to provide supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the logistics supply, a large number of cattle, sheep and livestock were constantly being slaughtered. He saw it in his eyes and was anxious in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the most valuable means of production of each tribe. If they are all slaughtered here, life will be difficult in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war is won and a lot of wealth is plundered, they can also rely on smuggling trade to obtain supplies from the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war is lost, a large-scale food crisis will break out, and the internal struggle for survival resources will be extremely fierce. Whether the orc empire can exist is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Majesty Xiong Huang, the more we have to be patient at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has experienced how difficult the defense line of the Alpha Kingdom is. With the current strength of the empire, the enemy's defense line to be stormed is simply unrealistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our pressure is great, and the enemy's pressure is even greater. A group of aristocratic lords who have lost their fiefs will put pressure on the enemy commander for us, forcing him to lead his army out to a decisive battle with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the arrival of the enemy's reinforcements will be the time for the decisive battle between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the protection of the city, we have to defeat the enemy, and the difficulty has dropped by more than one level. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel explained indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is ever-changing, and it is impossible to follow the plan. The enemy didn't play their cards according to the routine, and didn't fight them to the death in the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang, so the original battle plan would naturally change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's strategic contraction, while preserving the vitality of the kingdom, also planted the seeds of a decisive battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the noble lords of the seven provinces in northern Xinjiang want to regain their lost land, they must defeat the orc empire on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Daniel, your analysis is good, the enemy is indeed going to fight us, but the time is unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current signs, the Alpha Kingdom should have changed its coach. Everyone has fought against Hudson, and there is no trace of this guy's use of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his position in the Alpha Kingdom Army, it is possible to temporarily suppress the voice of the main combat faction, and wait for a year and a half to wait until the situation of the continental war becomes clear before fighting us decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom's success doesn't mean that the empire can also. Although the army of elves has gone south, judging from the current situation, the alliance is still at a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race wins the continental war, everyone should know what will happen later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Empire can defeat an Alpha Kingdom, but cannot defeat an Alpha Kingdom supported by the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, Moxi's army has also begun to gather towards the border. The total number of troops deployed on the front line is estimated to be no less than 250,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi, it is not surprising that these armies suddenly joined the war when the war entered a critical moment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon Emperor Alex said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His military command ability is not very good, but his political talent is full. Being able to keep the position of the orc royal family when the vitality of the Behemoth family was seriously injured was due to political means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world of great contention, one should not only focus on one place, but also look at the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war on the northern continent was only one of the factors that affected the outcome of the war. It was the outcome of the continental war that really determined the fate of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty Bimon, please forgive me for my inability to win or lose the Continental War!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the empire is no longer at its peak, and all we can do is take care of our eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an imperial soldier, what you have to do is: defeat the Alpha Kingdom at the least cost, and keep the empire's foundation on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The game of the continental war is no longer something that the empire can participate in. Instead of extravagantly hoping to intervene in the continental war, it is better to expect problems within the human race and give up supporting the restoration of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel replied forcefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once war is linked to politics, it is a burden to the commander, but war cannot be separated from politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combination of contradictory combinations is a disaster for the current orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any talk about politics beyond the scope of one's own strength is to force oneself to add drama. War is cruel, and a supporting role is a supporting role. Forcibly adding drama will only appear nondescript.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the flames of summer, the frontline ushered in reinforcements. In fact, with the efficiency of the Alpha Kingdom, the arrival time of reinforcements shouldn't be so slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in arriving until now is because Hudson sent people to train the recruiting army for a month before letting the troops start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, it is all caused by logistics. There is not a slight difference in the materials needed to stay in place to carry out military training, and to go to the front line of the Northland for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although nobles from all over the country have also trained their troops before, Hudson has no confidence in them. Especially the army of the minor nobles, the training is obviously not in place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed on, and the five recruiting legions are all disbanded and replenished into the various troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five standing corps were merged into the Seventh Front Army, and I personally served as the commander and used it as the reserve of the whole army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unreasonable order caused the generals to whisper to each other, but they were only intimidated by Hudson's prestige and did not dare to directly jump out to oppose it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are precedents for recruiting legions as supplementary troops. There is nothing controversial. The key is to leave five standing legions as reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous wars, most of them went directly to stud. If there are insufficient troops, they will ask for help from the country. What is the reserve?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you insist on reserve service, then the regiment directly under the guard headquarters should be considered the reserve service of the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually speaking, when it is their turn to fight, it is the most dangerous time of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes not expressing an opinion is silent opposition. I didn't jump out directly, mainly because I was afraid of spraying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As well-known as Hudson's command ability, there is also his spraying technique. Countless things have been sprayed by him with doubts about life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-ranking noble officers are all face-saving, and after suffering a few times, they all learned to be shrewd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering something incomprehensible, the first thing to do is not to jump out to refute, but to encourage others to go up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a group of smart people gathered together, the scene in front of them appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, and you haven't executed the order yet!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no time to explain the reason. In the army, he only needs everyone to execute orders. It's not specifically training generals, whether they can understand why is not important at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The generals hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who has been with Hudson knows the weight of the \"military order like a mountain\", and those who dare to disobey the military order will now have grass on their graves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how noble your status is, it is useless in front of this powerful marshal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not strong enough, these days, Hudson is also Alexander. All the lords of Northern Xinjiang came to harass him every now and then, and they all wanted to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The generals left one after another, and only the Earl of Oran, who had a special relationship, stayed. He obviously had something to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, is there anything else?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My father-in-law is not the one who makes things happen. As a traditional nobleman, the Earl of Oran has always attached great importance to rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't spray, there's no time\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

He wouldn't want to, if possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But people can't help themselves in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the nobles in northern Xinjiang, if you want to get involved in this circle, you must stand with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to Hudson's deterrence, a group of emerging nobles did not dare to make mistakes, and the Earl of Oran, who had a special relationship with him, was pushed to the foreground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Oran had no choice, he had to do this early bird. If the other people come over, if the conversation breaks down accidentally, they might die accidentally on the battlefield at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Members of the Koslow family can also become \"representatives\", but the status of those small nobles is too low, and their words have no weight at all. The most suitable candidate is the Earl of Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are so impatient!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the reinforcements arrived, they ran over to urge him to send troops to fight the enemy. Who is the commander in chief?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, those who violate the authority of the commander will not end well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of fighting in the South and North, Hudson is also used to seeing life and death, and his mentality has long been cultivated. The nobles in northern Xinjiang are quiet and obedient, and he will not be soft-hearted if they do something wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, it's not that everyone is impatient, it's just that we can't hold it anymore!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evacuated in a hurry, we were forced to give up most of our property, and all the northern lords suffered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay that it's summer now, just build a grass shed and you can make do with it. In a few months, what will happen to the millions of people? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran explained with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be a noble lord. While enjoying wealth, one must also assume corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Organizing the retreat of the people in the territory is only the beginning of the trouble; after the evacuation is completed, you must also be responsible for the livelihood of the people in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, during the evacuation process, everyone has already paid a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the process of fleeing for their lives in a hurry, not only lost a lot of property, but also lost a lot of lives. Nearly one-fifth of the people fell on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang are all immigrants, and the proportion of the elderly and the weak is relatively low, otherwise the loss will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No choice, no matter how heavy the loss is, it is better than a group destruction. In order to cover the retreat of the people, the Kingdom's army also paid a considerable price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, serfs also belonged to the private property of nobles. According to the general principle, whoever owns the wealth will guard it, and it is basically useless to expect the kingdom to rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the help of the Kingdom Army during the evacuation process, the rest was basically handled by the noble lords themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson understands the mentality of the nobles in northern Xinjiang very well. Every day when he wakes up, he thinks of countless mouths waiting to be fed, and no one can bear to sit and eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for some small nobles with limited family resources, if the kingdom cannot recover the lost land in time, the only way to wait for them is to sell the serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to sell the serfs, but it is difficult to replenish them. Territory without population, even if it is taken back, it has no value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if the Holliser family is in difficulty, the Koslow family can provide you with some help, but this cannot be a factor that affects the decision-making of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current pain is only for a short time. It may be cruel, but there is always a way to solve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom is defeated, everyone's territory will be lost. Don't imagine that the Terran Alliance will take care of us, the times have changed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking venture capital from investors, and now that the business is successful, it is natural to give back to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is limited to the Holliser family, and other nobles in the northern land have nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not afraid of being picked on. The Koslow family is also a victim, and the branch of the family in northern Xinjiang has also suffered heavy losses along with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collateral branches are unable to bear the loss, so they can ask the family for help, and other nobles can follow suit if they want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few families who broke their boats and ran to northern Xinjiang to develop, there were only a few grassroots nobles, and no family could support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the entire northern Xinjiang aristocratic system, the proportion of these nobles is less than one-tenth of the total.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true to calculate the loss, the biggest loss should be the royal family. The territory of three provinces was lost at once, and hundreds of thousands of refugees were added to reach out for food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV was not in a hurry, which proved that these losses were still within everyone's tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Kingdom's rich experience in being beaten can really train people's mentality. The capital of the kingdom fell more than once, not to mention only losing a few frontier provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    opened his mouth, but Earl Oran didn't say anything in the end. Being able to get this promise is already good, but to continue this topic is to be disgusting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the benefit of all my colleagues, it is obviously not worth affecting the relationship with my son-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Earl Oran, who seemed to have thought of something, said awkwardly: \"Hudson, I really need your help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other issues are easy to talk about, the key is that the price inflation in the Northland is too fast, a pound of rye can be sold for 18 copper coins, almost catching up with the price of beef! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change of title also means that a public matter has become a private matter. The originally tense atmosphere suddenly eased down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influx of a large number of refugees directly led to skyrocketing prices in the Northland, especially food prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an exaggeration that the price of rye is catching up with beef. The price of rye in the north is indeed approaching the price of beef in the southeast province, and you can buy three pounds directly if you replace it with fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, this is indeed a problem. I will interview the five northern dukes later and try my best to persuade them to come forward to curb prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this may not be effective. The most important problem at present is the destruction of the port, resulting in a serious decline in shipping capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the battlefield is unclear, and no one can tell when the war will end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keeping refugees in the North has been a heavy economic burden. It is better to send them back to their hometown first, and let them come after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, you can pass this suggestion on to the lords. It's up to them to listen or not, anyway, I can't guarantee that the war will end in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orcs take the initiative to retreat and give up the land, I will not regain the lost land until I solve the logistics problems of the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to create a farce, they simply broke everyone's illusions. The current battlefield in northern Xinjiang seems to be a military problem, but it is actually a logistical problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nest in the current position, the kingdom can meet the material consumption of the army. Once it's out, there's no way to guarantee it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the battle is won, there is no way to expand the results. That being the case, then simply spend it with the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the kingdom consumes a lot, and the army of orcs also consumes a lot. The productivity of the Alpha Kingdom is stronger than that of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the kingdom blocked the orc empire on both sea and land lines, almost eradicated the smuggling trade, and it was difficult for the orcs to continue to obtain supplies from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if they can pass through the Forest of Despair, they can also go to the Ice and Snow World to do business with the tribe of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But just buy food. If there were surplus food to sell, there wouldn't be so many ancient survivors who would have evolved into omnivores and ate fresh grass and leaves instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless all the orcs changed to eating dirt, as long as it took a year or two to delay, there would be no need for the kingdom's army to attack, and the orc army itself would be dragged down by the logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can drag the enemy to death, there is no need to attack. Hudson, who has already made great achievements in battle, is not bad at defeating the orcs now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not taking the initiative to initiate a decisive battle does not mean doing nothing. Direct reckless consumption, the kingdom will also suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The finances were rescued from the brink of bankruptcy with great difficulty. If the war dragged on for a year or two, the custody of the kingdom's finances would go bankrupt directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, what Hudson was waiting for was not the collapse of the orc army, but the completion of the expeditionary army's rest and replenishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To deal with the orcs in the nomadic era, an elite cavalry is really important. Hudson didn't want to use infantry against cavalry on the vast prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffering years are always long. It was another two months in a flash, and the army of the kingdom was still huddled in the city, no matter how provocative the orc army was, they ignored it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, under the propaganda of the officers, the morale of the orc soldiers was high, thinking that the human race was afraid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But gradually the situation changed. No matter how high the morale was, it sometimes let down. The pressure on Duke Daniel was increasing day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the military conference, the dissatisfaction among the officers of various ethnic groups continued to rise, and more and more people criticized his strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The several emperors who originally supported him gradually wavered under internal pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Daniel, we have all retreated five hundred miles, but the enemy still hasn't made any movement. There is no way to retreat like this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy will not take the bait, no matter how many arrangements they make, it will be useless in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy logistical pressure has made all ethnic groups breathless. Even if the five royal families uniformly rationed supplies, they could not meet the needs of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the orc army did not dare to disband.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today is different from the past, the current five royal families work together to barely suppress the enemy. Once dispersed, that is the beginning of disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't want to be defeated one by one by the Alpha Kingdom, they can only stand firm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no threat to survival, after recovering the lost land, they should disband the army and go home to have a baby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no real benefit to smashing the Alpha Kingdom. To dominate the mainland, this dream has long been awakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no way, the internal pressure cannot shake Hudson's determination, and the defense of the Alpha Kingdom is too tight. I have sent troops to test several times, but have not found a loophole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is almost no hope for a frontal attack and breakthrough. If they use the excuse from the Principality of Moxi to attack the Alpha Kingdom in a detour, there is some hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that with the current military strength of the empire, it is too dangerous to divide the troops. If the roundabout attack fails to break through quickly, it is very likely that the remaining army will suffer a major defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is willing to take risks, we can design a plan to pretend to divide our troops and see if we can draw the main force of the enemy out of the city wall. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel explained solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the battle between the strong, the simpler the tactics, the better. Fancy tricks will only make the situation worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allowing the refugees to evacuate was originally a psychological attack strategy he prepared, but unfortunately the nobles in northern Xinjiang were not as \"combat\" as he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the \"nobles of the seven provinces\" work together to exert pressure, and any commander will be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The psychological attack failed, and the auxiliary lure tactics failed again. When he proposed to lure the enemy again, Duke Daniel did not have much confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the seemingly peaceful battlefield, the two sides have played games many times. He saw Hudson's plan, and Hudson saw through his deployment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the circumstances that no one can fool the other, the competition between the two sides is the comprehensive national strength. Whoever can't afford to make the first move will be in a passive position strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of failure not only failed to defeat Daniel, but inspired his fighting spirit, but it also hit the confidence of the top leaders of the Orc Empire to win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of Hudson's \"No. 1 General\" was promoted by them for political needs. If there are too many lies, it will inevitably be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"boosting\" of the enemy finally became a reality. Is there anything more cruel than this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then try it, as long as you can lure the enemy out for a decisive battle, it is worth paying a certain price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom is not severely damaged, we will have trouble sleeping and eating!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Daniel, don't take too much burden on you. The battle situation on our side is not good, but the progress of the allies is very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the central continent, the coalition forces formed by the elves and the ancient survivors have defeated the human coalition forces, and are about to join forces with the stone people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If things go well, the spheres of influence of the stone people, trolls, and three-eyed tribes will be connected with the alliance of elves and ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan of the elves, they will also open up channels with the dwarves and cannibals in the future. As long as we defeat the Alpha Kingdom, the entire alliance will be connected in the future, completely changing the passive strategic situation of the alliance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon Emperor Alex encouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is different. Even though everyone knows that the elf army is making good progress, after his exaggeration, everyone's emotions are still excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the territory of the alien alliance can be connected together, and whether everyone can communicate with each other and develop together, the situation will be completely different from the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention immediately pulling down the human race from its position as the hegemony of the mainland, at least everyone's genocide crisis is gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** massacre of the Frankish kingdom in the half-orc kingdom frightened all the tribes, and no one wanted to follow in the footsteps of the half-orcs one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition formed by the elves and the ancient survivors was able to progress smoothly. The biggest reason was that the stone people, the three-eyed tribe, and the trolls were all desperately trying to hold back the enemy's main force at all costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When all the orcs were rejoicing, the urgent battle report outside the camp interrupted everyone's good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Five Your Majesties, something is wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was an urgent report from the rear that an enemy army landed in Bimon Port (New Port) three days ago and entered the prairie...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the orderer finished speaking, Daniel grabbed the military newspaper and checked it immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more he looked at the content above, the more surprised he became. After regaining Beamon Port, they did not destroy the waterway for the future economic development of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just such a small mistake, but I didn't expect it to lead to big trouble. Tens of thousands of ethnic cavalry landed from Beamon Port and carried out a frantic slaughter on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the defenders stationed in Beamon Port were wiped out, but the nearby orc tribes, big and small, also fell ill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young and the strong are fighting on the front line, and the old and weak who stay behind are no match for the enemy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What angered Daniel the most was that the enemy had landed two days ago, and they only received the news now, missing three full days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, three days is enough to change many things. An uncontrolled enemy army came in, and the damage it could cause was unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losses mentioned in the battle report were ambiguous, but Daniel knew that the actual loss was far greater than what was described in the battle report. After all, this game was lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rear has encountered trouble, and the impact on the frontline army is huge. Daniel gritted his teeth angrily and said, \"Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he already regarded Hudson as the enemy of the wolf in life. He did not plan in advance that the enemy would launch an attack from the sea, which became his biggest mistake since joining the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the current situation is critical. In order not to shake the morale of the frontline army, we must immediately block the news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being reminded by Daniel, the five emperors also realized the seriousness of the problem. The old nest has been taken over by others, who is in the mood to fight!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But war is such a thing, and family members are not allowed. Even if the nomadic race can carry livestock, the farming race among the orcs cannot carry the fields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they bring their family members by force, water and food are still big problems. After all, there are too few orcs who can eat soil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Daniel, you give the order! What to do next, just implement it according to your ideas.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang took the lead in expressing his opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not a good time to fight for command. How difficult Hudson is, he feels the deepest. Faced with such an enemy, Xiong Renhuang thought he was helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't handle it yourself, let someone else do it. Daniel and Hudson confronted each other for three or four months. Although they didn't achieve any impressive results, at least they didn't suffer much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the urgent battle report just received does not count. Otherwise, it is not a matter of suffering, but of blood loss.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Aw...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roar of vultures broke the tranquility of the grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle is over, leaving only the wreckage all over the ground, and the scorched earth after burning, telling the cruelty of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another orc tribe was destroyed, and the eagle officer who came to investigate had a gloomy and terrifying face. This was the thirteenth tribe that had an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feng Shui turns around. Since the human cavalry entered the prairie, the slaughter of orc tribes has become the norm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce losses, the imperial court asked them to notify the tribes as quickly as possible so that they could migrate as soon as possible to avoid the enemy's soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the war, the population of the Orc Empire plummeted rapidly, especially the loss of the vassal races was even greater, less than a quarter of what it was five years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to lose, and the orc empire will die. Without the support of a large number of vassal races, the five royal families alone cannot support an empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Baihu, we are late. Judging from the situation at the scene, the battle should have happened yesterday. The enemy not only killed everyone in the Kagu tribe, but also took away some of the livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can track through the horseshoe prints, and it shouldn't be too difficult to find where the enemy army is currently active. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the soldier finished speaking, the middle-aged hundred-family officer reprimanded him: \"Gareth, don't be smart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our task is to inform the nearby tribes to avoid the enemy's edge, not to find the enemy's location.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the empire's rear is empty, and there is simply no army that can deal with the enemy in a short period of time, and it is useless to find their positions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These reasons are all excuses. The reason why they didn't catch up is because the middle-aged officers haven't lived enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Activities on the grasslands, there is no intelligence. The Griffon Dragoons, the main force of the Royal Air Force, naturally appeared in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lean forward rashly, once discovered by the enemy air force, it will be difficult to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the enemy's landing was not released immediately. The main reason was that the enemy's air force took action to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same is the air force, most of the eagle soldiers are weaker than the human monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that their talents are not good, but that the population base is too small. The human monster cavalry are all elites, but they are all soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a veteran who survived the war, the biggest characteristic of middle-aged Baihu is that he has self-knowledge, only does work within his ability, and does not challenge the limits of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gareth, who had been scolded, suddenly collapsed. An opportunity to do meritorious service just flew away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to say something, a scream suddenly came from his ear. An Eagle soldier who was traveling with him accidentally stepped on a trap, was pierced by a bone spur, and died immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, the corpses on the ground suddenly came to life and attacked them frantically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are necromancers in the enemy army, and the corpses are transformed into undead. All Eagles immediately lifted off and evacuated here first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged Baihu hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This order was issued a bit late, the undead transformation ceremony has been completed. These undead creatures without command are now only fighting by instinct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a brief moment, two more Eagle soldiers died in battle. Of the ten-member team that came together, only the middle-aged Baihu and Gareth survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking down at the undead creatures scurrying around below, Gareth gave a look of hatred. Just at the moment just now, his best friend brother has been swallowed by undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Walk!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without giving him time to hesitate, the middle-aged Baihu grabbed him and flew directly into the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to be sad, the command still needs them to pass on information. Undead creatures are the enemy of all living beings. The enemy creates undead on the prairie, which is to break the roots of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are not extinguished quickly, once a king is born among these undead creatures, there will soon be an army of undead sweeping all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, Hudson has quietly entered the army, commanding the cavalry to kill all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the orc tribes being destroyed one after another, his heart remained calm, as if everything was taken for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the enemy has begun to form an army to surround us. Many neighboring tribes are spontaneously moving closer, and there are no suitable targets nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you want to be big with one vote, simply take away their alliance, and wipe out the last resistance force in this area in one fell swoop? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Ebert excitedly proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fight orcs, all alphas are aggressive. The kind of hatred engraved in the bones is enough for everyone to bring their own dry food to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Hudson to copy the orc's lair, it made the expeditionary army even more excited. If this battle is won, he will have the capital to brag for the rest of his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the ancient survivors who don't have much sense of existence, it is obvious that the orcs are more well-known in the hearts of the Chinese people, and they are more bragging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, they want to gather, let them gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order and continue to pick small and medium-sized tribes that have not yet gathered. Let the legions divide their troops to attack in all directions according to the actual situation, the louder the noise, the better! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is good to gather together, I am afraid that the orcs will not gather. When hundreds of thousands or even millions of people gather together, the survival of humans and animals becomes a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what kind of grassland, it can't support so many people and livestock. When resources are insufficient, disputes arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the situation of internal and external troubles arises, it is even more difficult to take care of oneself, and it is even more a dream to support the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Hudson wants to see most now is that the orcs live in a mixed race, and they don't need to do anything. The conflicts accumulated in the past can destroy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal conflicts are contagious, and once they erupt, they will quickly spread from part to whole in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is a matter of the future. In the short term, under the pressure of foreign enemies, these contradictions will be forcibly suppressed by those in power of all ethnic groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real significance of this raid is to destroy the production of the Orc Empire and weaken their war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the generals replied in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is always self-taught to do things like sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slaughtering small tribes is destruction, creating undead is destruction; burning the enemy's camp, food and grass, slaughtering their livestock, and driving the enemy away is also destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't care about the process, he just wants the result. In order to win the war at the least cost, the bottom line is to drop again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they are facing the orcs, and there is the power of hatred in front of them. No matter how hard the toss is, no one will have any objections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, butcher, executioner, devil...a series of hats are put on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is: the higher his prestige in the kingdom, the higher his hatred among the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps for a long time to come, his reputation in the Beastman Empire will be an existence that can make children cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force penetrated to the rear and crazily destroyed the orc empire. A series of bad news continued to gather to the orc high-level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood massacre\", \"Tide of refugees\", \"Undead natural disaster\", \"Tribal Gathering\"... The messy news gathered together, and the high-level leaders of the Orc Empire collectively became confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood massacre\" created \"Undead Scourge\", everyone understands very well, and they have done similar things in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no expansion, it is because they need food, and they are reluctant to transform the corpses into undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Refugee Wave\", everyone has also played. The effect is really good, and once relied on this thing to make the Warhammer cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gathering of tribes behind was done passively. Everyone is a little puzzled by the enemy's deliberate indulgence, but they can also find excuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    alone, they can understand. But when these messy measures come together, it is beyond everyone's ability to understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, taking the creation of \"refugees\" and \"natural disasters of the undead\" as examples is a set of contradictory measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To create undead creatures, besides summoning them from another world, the best way is to transform them directly after killing wildly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to engage in massacres, you will naturally not be able to play with the refugee wave. After all, there are only so many orcs, and it is impossible to take care of all of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps this is a division within the enemy. There are also many factions in the Alpha Kingdom. It is normal for everyone to have different positions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I didn't expect that they all came to the battlefield and still didn't reach an agreement, and they played freely according to their own will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that Hudson is not there, no one can suppress them, and this situation has appeared! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bimon Emperor Alex made a reasonable analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unintelligible problems must have reasons behind them. If you don't know what Hudson is thinking, you can only make reasonable self-assumptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's useless, no matter what happens on the enemy's side, we are in big trouble now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now only the area near Bimon Port is affected. As the range of enemy cavalry activities continues to expand, the entire central grassland will be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing small and medium tribes together can only solve the urgent need. The fact that the enemy has not attacked does not mean that the enemy cannot break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troops in the rear are empty, even if you gather millions of tribesmen, you won't be able to gather many troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, when a large number of clansmen gather together, life is also a big problem. Now that the forage in stock is consumed, what should I do when winter comes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the attack on the rear, our logistics will also face the most severe challenge. In a short period of time, it can still be supported by reserves, and if the stored food is used up in a month, it will be a big trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it's better to seize the time to attack, break down a few enemy fortresses first, and get some supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, quickly find a way to destroy the enemy army in the rear, stabilize the foundation of the empire, and then wait for the opportunity to fight the enemy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being defeated by the enemy, but being dragged down by the enemy, this is the first time he has encountered such a useless battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to lose, you have to lose on the battlefield. Because the supply of supplies is insufficient, if you are hungry and defeated by the enemy, you will lose face to the Lion Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the pressure on Duke Daniel increased greatly. The accumulated conflicts were finally brought to light after the defeat on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he is in the same situation as Marquis James, and they are both representatives of a misstep and eternal hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the enemy attacked from the sea and was not under the control of the commander. Everyone did not record the responsibility for the attack in the rear on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that James has a better substitute. Kicking him down will help the subsequent war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel's position as the coach is still stable. Looking at the entire Orc Empire, his military achievements are the most impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when the human allied forces stepped on the prairie and pushed the orc empire to a desperate situation, he organized several beautiful counterattacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It didn't change the outcome of the war, and that didn't affect Daniel's image as a military **** in everyone's mind. After all, the disparity in racial strength is too great to be reversed by one's own efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty the Lion King, I have a hunch that Hudson is no longer on the front line, but has gone deep into the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is the enemy's trump card main force that is plundering the grassland. This small expeditionary army has disabled the alliance of the ancient survivors and wiped out hundreds of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the same strength, the empire is afraid that only the most elite Beamon cavalry can compete with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a strong army, coupled with a top coach like Hudson. Sending some reinforcements in the past can only give the enemy a record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I decided to personally lead 50,000 cavalry back to aid and fight Hudson on the prairie to avoid the situation from expanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontline command, please entrust the five emperors. Hudson is not here, and it is estimated that the defenders will not dare to come out, so there will be no major problems! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel said in a heavy tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One step is wrong, every step is passive. He didn't want to be led by the nose by the enemy, but the situation forced him to be led away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you continue to stay on the front line, the rear will be collapsed by the enemy. Even if the front line wins a big victory, it will still be \"winning the war and losing the empire\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the emperors hesitated for a moment, but finally nodded their heads in response. Handsome talents are rare, and in the orc empire with a more solidified class, there are very few people who are capable of commanding an army of 1.8 million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for Daniel, who is an outstanding member, only a few of them have the experience of commanding millions of troops. Although they ended in failure, it was also a valuable accumulation of experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the five emperors made eye contact, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said earnestly: \"Daniel, I will leave the rear to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    50,000 elite cavalry, you choose from the army yourself, and all the troops left behind will be under your command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one requirement, and we must annihilate this enemy army that dares to penetrate into our rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of precedent cannot be set, otherwise the human race will rely on their maritime superiority, and similar things will continue to happen in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lack of good ports in the north does not mean that they cannot be opened up the day after tomorrow. With the strength of the human race, as long as they are willing to spend their money, even if the ground is full of rocks, they can still smash a route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If conditions permit, it is best to keep Hudson on the battlefield. This guy is simply the nemesis of the empire. Whenever we meet him, we have never had a better time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The further back, the more angry the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor became. If he had known that Hudson was so difficult, he should have been killed in the cradle.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The battle lasted for two days and two nights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, because the headquarters was attacked by the enemy, dozens of high-level generals, including Marshal Angcott, died in the chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After losing the command system, the Allied forces unfortunately collapsed yesterday afternoon, and the entire territory of Korubia fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Earl Nicholas' words fell, the hall became completely silent. Everyone showed stunned expressions, and they couldn't believe it was true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more than 800,000 troops gathered by the countries of the Central Continent were wiped out so quickly, and the collapse speed was faster than the previous collapse of the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small countries in the Northern Continent fought independently, and they also held back the elf army for more than half a year. Of course, this also includes the early paddling time of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is cruel. No matter what the reason is, the performance of the Central Continental Allied Forces is unqualified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't make any sense to accuse the alien race of not following the rules. Because continental wars have never been a place for rules, here everyone only judges heroes by success or failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, is the sudden collapse of the front line really just because the headquarters was attacked by the enemy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people present were not fools. They knew very well that the Allied forces had been suppressed and beaten by the enemy before, and the front line was retreating again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than saying that the headquarters was attacked by the enemy, it might be better to say that there was a problem with the deployment of the frontline army, which allowed the enemy to enter the headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Allied Command is located very far back, surrounded by armies in all directions, making it difficult to be attacked by surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs mentioned that it was the \"enemy army\" who attacked the headquarters, not the \"enemy masters\" listed in a separate note.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nuances in the language allowed a group of political powerhouses to instantly capture the key message.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it, and no one came out to disrupt it. After suffering such a big defeat, if the blame is not passed on to the enemy, it will be difficult for the country to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long while of silence, everyone was relieved from the shocking news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is no secret that the Allied Forces are composed of multinational armies, with mixed internal forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the battle report focuses on the army of elves, in fact, their previous defeat was just beaten by a group of ancient remnant allied forces, and the accompanying elves only provided magic strikes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more you understand the urgency of the current situation. Without the allied forces blocking the front, the flames of war will inevitably spread to the hinterland of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the top ten kingdoms in the mainland, the Kingdom of Hesse is certainly not so weak that it fails once, or cannot climb up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crux of the problem is that the main force of the kingdom was held back by the stone people, and the mobile forces that could be mobilized had just suffered a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific loss of troops has not yet been calculated, but the allied forces can't stop the enemy's front, and it is even more hopeless to rely on a group of remnants to defeat the general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What plans does the Ministry of Military Affairs have next?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is really no other way, his profession is a king, not a **** of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I do know some military knowledge, but only so much. To solve the current unfavorable situation, Alexander V's military knowledge reserve is obviously not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the barrier of the defeated kingdom of the Allied Forces has been lost, and we can only rely on ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the kingdom's army in the allied army suffered heavy losses, and it is almost 100% likely to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are lucky enough to recover a life from the battlefield, the morale of the army will be seriously frustrated, and it will be difficult to use it in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the kingdom has formed five more legions, plus the troops mobilized by nobles from all over the country, it should be able to gather 20 legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are only used to defend the city, these recruits are also worthy of use, and should be able to buy a lot of time for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends on the enemy's next attack direction. There are already many countries bordering on the enemy. As long as it does not become the main direction of the enemy's attack, we should be able to defend it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs plans to bring back another five legions from the stone-human battlefield, together with the 20 legions currently mobilized, to jointly carry out the next defense mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to regain the lost land, you have to wait until the human race wins this continental war...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nicholas said without confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was about to scratch his head for this unreliable contingency plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization speed of the Kingdom of Hesse is too slow. It has been almost three months since the Allied forces fought against the enemy before mobilizing such a small force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more depressing is that the 200,000 troops he talked about are likely to be a paper data. The actual mobilization situation in various places may be even worse than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king issued a recruitment order, and many people were stunned. It's not that everyone doesn't actively implement it, but that many noble lords went to the front line early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by inexperience. Not long after the war broke out, a large number of noble lords were summoned to join the army and ran to attack the stone people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be fine if they fought desperately, but the Hessian high-level officials wanted to take the opportunity to consume the power of the small vassal country, driving the younger brothers to desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the plan is perfect. It not only hits the enemy, but also removes hidden dangers and consolidates its own position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the younger brothers are not stupid. Sending troops to participate in the war does not mean working hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct consequence is: the Kingdom army, which had been prepared for a long time, clearly took the lead, but missed the best opportunity in vain, giving the enemy sufficient time to prepare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side is a war involving the life and death of the race, and the other side is only passively slowing down the whole process to complete the boss task. The final result can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the army of elves came to attack the door, the multinational coalition forces headed by the Kingdom of Hesse failed to defeat the stone people, but were dragged down by them with a large number of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why did it take so long to mobilize this little force? Is there no one in my Kingdom of Hesse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the great nations of the human race, the Kingdom of Hesse, which has enjoyed peace for many years, has a population larger than that of the Alpha Kingdom, with a population of more than 40 million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, after the war broke out, the total force they mobilized was almost the same as that of the Principality of Moxi next door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a principality with a population of less than 10 million. At its peak, its total military strength once exceeded one million. Now the Hesse Kingdom has only a total of one million troops mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can accept this kind of strong contrast. At this moment, Alexander V's dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Military Affairs has accumulated to the breaking point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bureaucracy killed people, and Earl Nicholas only felt wronged. He really tried his best, but some things cannot be solved by working hard alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are serious problems in the entire mobilization system. Whether it is the mobilization mechanism in various places or the supporting logistics infrastructure, none of them can meet the needs of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is determined by the kingdom's mobilization mechanism. After the war broke out, you immediately issued a recruitment order, and most of the kingdom's lords enlisted in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people are not in the place, and our various measures cannot be implemented in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the news, the person in charge of the left-behind territory usually has to ask the frontline lord for instructions, and then execute it after obtaining approval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the long distance in the middle, the troops are constantly changing stations, which invisibly reduces the efficiency of message transmission again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countless things that government orders cannot be implemented in time because they cannot be contacted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is only the implementation link, and there are still many procedures to go before the decree is issued. According to regulations, the orders issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs must be jointly approved by you and the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your reply was indeed timely, but the efficiency of the noble council is really impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representatives of the congressmen are not here, so they have to send someone to notify them one by one first. If they can't come in person, they will send someone to vote for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will be a round of the nobles' meeting in the royal capital, a round at the local and provincial level, and a round of the nobles' council in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the procedures are completed, the resolution must be reviewed again from the bottom to the top, and finally it will be publicized for seven days, and it will not be officially effective until no member of the assembly raises objections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if everything goes well, but if there is a problem in any link in the middle, the government order will be called back again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such repeated tossing, time is wasted on the process. Since the outbreak of the war, all officials in the Ministry of Military Affairs have canceled their holidays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In some areas of the kingdom, none of our earliest decrees have been passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister should be clear about this. In the past, he was the one who complained the most. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nicholas immediately complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some blame cannot be taken back, and the mobilization efficiency is low, and it is not his fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a joint-stock country, the rights and interests of nobles are fully protected. It is commonplace to veto the king's order through the form of parliament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Earl Nicholas is right. The kingdom's administrative efficiency really needs to be improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, all localities have already cooperated with the work of the Ministry of Military Affairs. In the past, if the government wanted to do something, there would be no result without arguing for a year or so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the Royal Capital Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It takes more than three years on average to implement local implementation; if it is to be promoted nationwide, the time period will be longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 90% of our proposals will be rejected at some point in the middle due to various reasons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Milton replied bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already greeted the entire family of Count Niklas. Calling him by name on this occasion, isn't it deliberately deceiving?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't know that the kingdom's administrative efficiency is low?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as the beginning of his succession, Alexander V wanted to carry out internal reforms, but there was too much resistance, and finally had to be terminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone understands the truth, but when it comes time to cut their own flesh, everyone is discouraged again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficiency of the Hesse Kingdom is low, but it protects the interests of the aristocratic group, and the aristocratic parliament gives them the power to say no to the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To improve the efficiency of the kingdom's governance, it is necessary to strengthen the authority of the central government and weaken the political voice of local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The efficiency is low, so find a way to improve it. If this continues, the kingdom will be destroyed. What's the use of more privileges?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V immediately reprimanded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He scolded fiercely, but deep down he was very happy. The long-awaited reform opportunity has finally appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War time is not suitable for big moves, but war time is also the easiest time to complete reforms. In peaceful times, it is no less difficult to ask the nobles to give up their own interests than to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they dare to touch their core interests, the king is not good at it. When the king cannot represent the interests of the majority of the nobles, there is a risk of being replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V didn't want to bear the infamy of the emperor, and was kicked out of power in despair. The reform plan has always been dusty deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the kingdom is on the verge of having to reform life and death, he deliberately guides the situation in the court and proposes political reforms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar successful reform cases also have precedents in the continent of Aslante, and the neighboring Alpha Kingdom and Moxi Principality are typical representatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both countries were invaded by orcs. At the critical moment when the country was ruined and the family was destroyed, the aristocratic groups were forced to make concessions in order to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the reform cannot be completed overnight. The top priority is to seek foreign aid to get through the current crisis first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See, the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia have watched the excitement for a long time, and if the situation is dragged down, they will be toyed with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the war situation in Central China collapses, the continental war initiated by the human race will be lost. No one can afford such consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should take active actions and urge them to send troops as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, Duke Milton, hastily made amends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king wants to promote political reform, and the prime minister should support it, but as a nobleman, he still can't accept such a thing of cutting his own flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contradictory psychology made him choose to be neutral. If the king wants to reform, he can cooperate, but don't expect him, the prime minister, to lead the reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already taken action, and I believe there will be results soon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Marquis Krasner hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't want to get involved in the topic of political reform, as that thing might kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, how can there be any reform without bloodshed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom and the Moxi Principality were able to reform successfully because the orcs helped them and killed people in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles were killed until they were terrified, so there was a consensus that everything was leaning towards war. The political reform carried out on this basis has won the approval of all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar scene also happened in Dante Kingdom and South Bank Kingdom. No matter who proposed the reform, anyway, this wind is blowing out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People of insight have realized that the previous political system cannot satisfy the current international competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, Hudson, who turned into a necromancer, is full of life every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the army finished fighting in front, he emerged from behind to transform the undead. Diligence is like a little bee, busy every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the number of necromancers in the army is limited. Transforming undead on a large scale requires a lot of magic power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not every necromancer is like Hudson, who has almost endless magic power and can squander it as much as he wants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price paid was a drastic reduction in the energy in the compass. Converted into cash, Hudson had already spent hundreds of thousands of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is worth it, undead creatures without command, running around on the prairie, will definitely affect the survival of the orc tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, these undead creatures are not really unmanned. After Hudson completed the transformation ceremony, he deliberately drove them to the area where the enemies gathered before letting them move freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the newborn undead is less than half of what it was in life. It is unrealistic to break through the orc camp, but it is very easy to clean up some orcs who came out alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct consequence is that grazing cannot be carried out normally. Undead creatures not only attack orcs, cattle, sheep and horses are also their hunting targets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using the cover of night to sneak into the orc camp and attack the animals, it happened almost every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the undead will be wiped out by the orcs in this process, there are also a few lucky ones who took the opportunity to obtain enough flesh and blood souls to complete the level promotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing is only a small problem, the key is the pollution brought by undead creatures, which is really troublesome for orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of undead creatures emerged, and the surrounding grasslands and water sources were damaged. The orcs didn't have enough priests to purify, forcing them to relocate their camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nomadic tribes often migrate, these are pediatrics, but one or two tribes acted alone, and now a group of tribes have gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The larger the number of people, the higher the requirements for water and fodder. The choice of migration route has to be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the enemies being forced to migrate one by one, Hudson was in a very good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighter, always easy to spawn in motion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc huddled together like a hedgehog. To kill an enemy, one must take the risk of being stabbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it moves, it is completely different. Without the protection of the camp, there are flaws everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more races and tribes that gather together, the bigger the gaps will be left, and you won't have to worry about not finding opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, I just received the news that the orcs have arrived separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has strictly blocked the news, and the specific number of troops, commanders, and marching routes are all a mystery now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just engaged in a wave of things, and received this news when he came back, Hudson's good mood became more and more high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Divide the troops, I am afraid that the enemy will not divide the troops!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An army of 1.8 million orcs gathered together is a tough bone. Not to mention that there is no meat when chewing, it will also hurt your teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send orders to the army commanders to speed up their work. Focus on the migrating orc tribes and eat these guys first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, tell them that the orc reinforcements have already set off, and they must be prepared to evade them in advance. Without my order, you are not allowed to fight the enemy's reinforcements without authorization! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all expected, and there is no need to be surprised. The only exception is that the orcs kept the reinforcements strictly confidential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to hide from the sight of the Griffin Dragoons is not because of how concealed they are hiding, but because of timely killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to do this, either the enemy has a large number of Hawkman Air Force accompanying them, or they are equipped with a large number of strong men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Expeditionary Corps as an example, as long as Hudson wants to hide, it will be difficult for the enemy to find their position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Whether it doesn't work or not, it will affect the international reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the countries in the Northern Continent asked for help in the early days, Charles III refused everyone's request to send troops on the pretext of being busy with the war with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were good reasons, after the situation in the northern continent collapsed, the prestige of the Frankish Kingdom on the mainland plummeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countries have gradually lost confidence in this boss who only takes benefits but does nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the situation deteriorates further, countries in the Central Mainland are now approaching the door again. The difference from before is that this time the situation is more dangerous, and it might threaten the foundation of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is okay to use war to suppress competitors, but the premise is that the human race must win the war. If the situation collapses, then the cart before the horse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How was the situation at the alliance meeting?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid leisure time, he basically did not attend the alliance meeting after the outbreak of the Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the mood of the representatives of various countries is very unstable. Especially the representatives of the destroyed countries of the Northern Continent, they even directly vented their anger at the conference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emotions of the representatives of the central countries are also very excited, and the words are really hard to hear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are busy arguing, and the issue of forming a coalition is not going well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Bergson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The establishment of the Continental Allied Forces has not been smooth sailing. Because of the different demands of interests, representatives of various countries often quarrel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, it is simply unrealistic to expect the Alliance Parliament to discuss the results without a year or so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make a decision in a short period of time, you should directly invite representatives of the Holy See and several major powers to communicate in private! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis **** said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the foreign minister of the kingdom, he has rich experience in doing this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to solve international problems, the common practice is to \"hold meetings for small things, and small meetings for big things.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Holy See and several major powers unify their positions, the rest of the countries will follow suit and just go through the motions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The army of elves is about to merge with the alien races in the mainland, and sooner or later there will be problems. The alliance must send reinforcements as soon as possible to prevent the worst situation from happening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter will be handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for coordination. We must urge countries to form coalition forces as soon as possible to reverse the current unfavorable situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charlie III said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most powerful country in the mainland, he has the confidence to say this. The continental war has progressed to the present, and the Frankish Kingdom has initially completed its own strategic goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meat has been eaten, and the potential competitors have also been weakened. Now is the time to come out to clean up the mess and gain international reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, in fact, we can also ask for benefits from other countries, allowing them to further open their domestic markets, break various trade restrictions, and allow people to enter and exit freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a cover, and the kingdom is not greedy for the little money in trade. The main reason is that we can get more refugees after they loosen the restrictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vast land left by the half-orc kingdom needs a large population to fill in, and the migration from the northern continent alone cannot meet the demand at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Duke Bergson said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong are always strong. Although the Frankish Kingdom has stood at the pinnacle of the mainland, they are still on the rise and have a progressive government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before launching the continental war, the government had made a plan to develop the half-orc kingdom, and now the only thing lacking is population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply immigrating from the country, this kind of development progress is too slow, and it cannot meet their needs at all, and war refugees have become an alternative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Prime Minister Bergson's plan is completed, the strength among countries will further increase. Frank's imperial dream is no longer a dream, but may become a reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right, we can try our best to fight for this aspect, and treat it as the military expenses they gave us for sending troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First set a goal, strive to obtain 500,000 immigrants from the three major kingdoms within the year, and then obtain 500,000 immigrants from the small countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Separate immigration activities, preferably in the form of private employment, to reduce the government's sense of existence as much as possible, so as not to arouse the vigilance of countries. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Central Continent and the Northern Continent is different. The three kingdoms are only in trouble temporarily, and their own strength is still very strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are also immigrants. When they obtain population from the small countries in the North Continent, they appear as saviors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is nobles, civilians, or serfs, they are all scrambling to leave that land to avoid being slaughtered by aliens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put on the banner of justice, even if it is a high-profile immigrant, the outside world will only think that it is helping refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same gameplay will not work in China. Now only part of the land has been occupied, and the whole country has not yet run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the alien army pushes too hard, it may be able to stimulate their potential. It may not be possible to reverse the push, and it is definitely no problem to stick to half of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the aristocratic groups of the three kingdoms still have some strength. Now it is only because the internal political system cannot keep up with the times, which limits their ability to exert their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, Hudson also knew the farce that happened in the Union Congress. It's no wonder that the representatives of the countries in the Northern Continent want to explode, it's really bullying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they asked for help earlier, the Alliance Council refused to open, so they refused it bluntly. Everyone held back their anger and had nowhere to vent it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that countries are ruined and families are ruined, the original care is gone, and you can vent your emotions as much as you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, as a member of parliament, he has the right to immunity from responsibility for speech. This is the core interest that all members of parliament jointly maintain and cannot be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The country is gone. If the country cannot be restored later, their career as a member of parliament will be over. If you don't vent your emotions, you won't have a chance to vent in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the representatives of the Alpha Kingdom to the Alliance, they were also blushed by the representatives of the seven grassland countries, and they hid their faces in shame and walked away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor issues, and they are just scolded. For politicians, they are nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farce is a small matter, and the problem behind the farce is the focus of Hudson's concern. As the commander-in-chief of the army, international politics is also a compulsory course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is said that the representatives of the countries in the Northern Continent are breaking the cans, then the representatives of the countries in the Central Continent are going crazy, which means that the situation is really getting out of hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be forced into a desperate situation, the aristocratic bureaucrats with good face usually don't show their cards directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Allied Continental Army is about to be born!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having come to this conclusion, Hudson smiled slightly. For the Alpha Kingdom, this is undoubtedly good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continent of Aslant is a game of chess, and the battle situation on the prairie is only a corner of the chessboard. To win the war, you still have to look at the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the mainland is undoubtedly the key factor that determines the advantage of the mainland in the war. Whoever wins the next battle in Central China will win this continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson is still very confident in Terran. It is true that the human race alliance is a mess, but it is a race after all. The foreign race alliance is not even a mess, it can only be said to be a hodgepodge full of mud, sand, stones, and sawdust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides organize their own coalition forces, then directly from the peak duel, it will be downgraded to a \"bad war\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more players involved, the more chaotic the chain of command. What will happen in the end, no one can tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of internal disputes, even if one side wins, it is difficult to take advantage of the trend to expand the results and maximize the interests of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What everyone will do is to maximize their own interests. Everyone is planning for themselves, and Hudson is very suspicious that after the human race defeats the alien race, the human race alliance will become an \"existence organization.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to consider the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emergence of the Continental Allied Forces will definitely support all battlefields. As one of the main battlefields of the Continental War, the prairie battlefield is also one of the battlefields supported by the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for the Alpha Kingdom to fight for it, the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland will fight for it by themselves. Only by completely defeating the Orc Empire can they re-establish their country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forces behind the dignitaries of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland are now also locked in. With such a large investment in the early stage, if they can't restore the country, their investment will only buy back a bunch of false titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King\", \"Grand Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Marquis\"...all of them are very important, but it is a pity that they need to be prefixed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deceased king of the Kingdom, deceased Grand Duke of the Principality, deceased...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to lose everything, you can only continue to invest. In a short period of time, even if it is impossible to send reinforcements to the prairie battlefield, a certain amount of material support must be provided to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have found traces of the main force of the enemy army eighty miles ahead. There are Beamon cavalry, lion cavalry, and wolf cavalry, with a total strength of tens of thousands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary judgment, this should be the troops sent by the orcs to help. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Tom finished speaking, Hudson did not hesitate, and immediately ordered: \"Send the order to let all the troops clean up the battlefield immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, turn around and bypass the enemy army ahead, let's go to find the bad luck of the orc tribe in the east! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A decisive battle is impossible. This is the territory of the orcs. The right time, the right place, and the right people don't take advantage of anything, and even the strength of the enemy is not clear, so the fool will go to the decisive battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have that skill, why not destroy a few more orc tribes to weaken the enemy's war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long after the expeditionary army left, the orc army that was rushing all the way also arrived on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the unburned tent fodder, Duke Daniel said helplessly: \"It's one step too late!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not the first time that I have passed by the expeditionary army. In order to find out the enemies that went deep into the grassland, the orc tribes all learned to use wolf smoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Efficient communication method, which can be clearly seen in a radius of dozens of miles. It is much more convenient and faster than traditional communication methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the communication method has been updated, but the enemy is still not able to be bitten. There is no way, the probability of two armies meeting head-on on the vast prairie is really too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the enemy is still deliberately avoiding them. Even chasing according to the horseshoe prints is useless. Many times after chasing and chasing, the enemy suddenly disappears, leaving only a group of horses running heartily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once again, they found traces of the enemy, and they were hundreds of miles away. When he rushed over with his team, the enemy army suddenly appeared hundreds of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the blood on the ground hasn't dried yet. The battle should have just ended. The enemy must not have gone far. Let's chase now...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the young officer who went to the battlefield to check could finish his sentence, the corpse on the ground suddenly started to move. Without the slightest hesitation, Daniel ordered indifferently: \"Kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nascent undead army is the best to deal with. If these guys become popular, the threat to the orc tribe will be great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In history, there was a plague of undead on the orc prairie, and the overwhelming undead creatures once swept across most of the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, the five royal families joined forces and used their own means to suppress the bottom of the box, and finally put out the army of undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original source of such a terrifying plague of the undead was that a small tribe was wiped out by the plague, and then turned into an undead creature for some reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, no one cared, the orc prairie is so vast, it is normal for a few undead to be born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By chance, a king happened to be born among these undead creatures. Under his command, the undead army grew rapidly like a snowball.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Orc Empire realized something was wrong and paid attention to it, it had already missed the best time to extinguish it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the disaster of the undead was successfully extinguished later, the best time to go south was missed, allowing the Alpha Kingdom to gain a firm foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, the Orc Empire has learned a lesson and immediately took action to exterminate undead creatures. Especially the undead creatures in groups cannot be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle went very smoothly. Facing the elite orc cavalry and the newborn undead creatures, it was difficult to form an effective resistance, and they were wiped out in less than an hour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After wiping the sword that was stained with the spirit of the undead, Duke Daniel asked solemnly: \"How many times have we encountered undead creatures?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this is the seventh time. Any tribe that has been slaughtered by the enemy will have a large number of undead creatures.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged general on the side replied hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also depressing. When I came back from the front line, I didn't find the shadow of the enemy. Instead, I fought seven battles with undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning is definitely winning, but there is no sense of accomplishment in fighting undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Seventh time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that Hudson is really ruthless enough. He is able to transform the undead on such a large scale. He may bring all the necromancers of the Alpha Kingdom with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know what the Holy See of Chenxi will think after receiving this news. The name of Alpha Kingdom's heresy stronghold seems to be well-deserved! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During speaking, Daniel's eyes burst into a sharp light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, he has decided to help the Alpha Kingdom to make a good publicity. Even if the civil war of the human race cannot be provoked, the relationship between the Holy See and the Alpha Kingdom must be deteriorated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of one more person who is holding back, the difficulty for the Alpha Kingdom to obtain help from the Human Race Alliance will inevitably increase significantly.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The expeditionary army that had just finished the battle looked like a killing **** who had just come out of hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing in front of the army under the scorching sun, Hudson still felt a chill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, a tribe group of hundreds of thousands of orcs disappeared under the butcher knife of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar battles have happened many times since entering the prairie. Almost every day, orc tribes are maimed by the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has developed to the present, and everyone has no intention to count the results of the battle. No matter how many ordinary orcs were beheaded, it would not be able to arouse everyone's interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order to recall the scattered troops, and move the whole army to the southwest. Next, we will fight a **** road!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how elite the army is, it is still a human being. It is inevitable to be physically and mentally exhausted by constantly killing on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the time of landing to the present, any soldier of the expeditionary force has a few beast lives in his hands. There are many people who beheaded hundreds of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"Grassland Killer God\" is definitely on Hudson's back. The orcs who escaped by chance will spontaneously help him with publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the orcs still exist, he is the most terrifying big devil. After all, the terrifying Abyss Demon King only stays in the legend, far less severe than the pain of the skin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the time could be restarted, I am afraid that 99% of the orcs would oppose launching this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War, apart from killing them, everyone has never seen any benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making achievements on the battlefield, looting wealth from the human world, and then reaching the pinnacle of animal life, it has almost become a fantasy legend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war has been going on for so long, no one has really gotten what they wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was okay when they attacked the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland before, although those guys were basically poor ghosts, at least they were easy to bully. If you hit the enemy, you will be defeated, and you can gain some gains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the invasion of the Alpha Kingdom, the situation has changed. After capturing seven provinces in a row, they did not get any decent spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Hudson took office, the situation became even more embarrassing. Not to mention robbing wealth, the enemy went to his hometown without even seeing a good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap between reality and ideal is too far, and it is inevitable that the animal heart will be turbulent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the ruthlessness of the expeditionary army, not many tribes were actually wiped out. Failure to win does not mean failure to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Get on the horse and run for your life in any direction. As long as you can outrun your teammates, you can escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst is still farming tribes, those with two legs cannot run with four legs. Facing the pursuit of the cavalry of the expeditionary army, only a few lucky ones can save their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Escaping the pursuit of the expeditionary army does not mean that the matter is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vast prairie is full of various dangers, wolves, undead, poisonous insects... These are all pediatrics, and the real danger is \"beastmen\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to meet a tribe of the same race. If unfortunately you stray into the sphere of influence of a hostile race, it's only a matter of time before you get on the grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the tribe was defeated, the orcs who died at the hands of their own people may not be much less than those killed by the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel hated this kind of cannibalism, and issued strict orders to prohibit it many times. The end result is that everyone does what they usually do, and they still do what they do now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention on the prairie, even in a military camp, if soldiers accidentally go to the wrong camp, they may become someone else's dinner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hatred is only one aspect of the factor, and more of it stems from the lack of materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless low-level orcs have been unable to fill their stomachs for many years. It seems that there are many cattle and sheep in the tribe, but none of them belong to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal to not see meat for a year or so. If the year is not good, it is not surprising to starve to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harsh living environment has created distorted values. The corpses of the same race have become an important source of meat for them, let alone foreign races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hurry up, a large group of cavalry is coming!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the greeting from his companions, the Leopard who had just won the victory quickly cleaned the battlefield and evacuated. Before leaving, he did not forget to take away the wild boar corpses on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the distance, Duke Daniel, who witnessed this scene in person, felt extremely heavy in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The empire is on the verge of life and death, and all the races in the country still haven't given up fighting among themselves. The scene in front of him was not an isolated case, it happened all the time in places he couldn't see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guards, bring back all those fleeing guys. I want to see where they are from, how dare they ignore my orders!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel ordered angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the infighting between various ethnic groups, it is inevitable to kill chickens and monkeys. It's fine if you don't see it. Since you bumped into it, you can't ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the perpetrators are not the five royal families, but middle races with slightly stronger fighting power. Kill people, and there will be no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The third team will attack with me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, a group of wolf cavalry rushed out. The werewolves who reacted a step slower showed annoyed expressions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a rare opportunity to show off in front of the coach, so he just slipped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with **** fights on the battlefield, the safety factor of hunting down a group of fleeing Leopards is obviously much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite is the elite after all, and in less than a cup of tea, the third brigade led a group of dejected Leopards and appeared in front of Duke Daniel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, please forgive me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Spare me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming Daniel's identity, begging for mercy kept ringing in his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The panic-stricken group of Leopards have already panicked at this moment, lost the ability to think about problems, and only know how to kowtow for mercy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you want to survive, give me a reason to let you go. You don't need to say the reasons that everyone often uses.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel's expressionless words made all the Leopards stop begging for mercy and start thinking about ways to save their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have no other choice!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The empire's food collection tasks are constantly increasing, and the tribe is already running out of money. If they don't want to find a way to get it from the outside world, they won't be able to survive this winter at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened that this group of wild boars sneaked into the tribe's ranch in an attempt to sabotage, so we shot them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The explanation given by the middle-aged leopard man is obviously somewhat inconsistent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes he said there was a lack of food, and another moment he said that the wild boars were causing damage. He forcibly tied the two irrelevant things together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speaker may not have the intention, but the listener has the intention. At this moment, the only thing left in Duke Daniel's mind was \"the task of requisitioning food is heavy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this war, the Orc Empire also gave everything it had, putting all its assets under pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is constantly moving forward, and the logistical pressure is also increasing day by day. Now that the front line is in a stalemate, it has turned into a war of attrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Burning the enemy's food and grass back then forced the Alpha Kingdom to sever their wrists and abandon the seven provinces in the northern border. Now it is the turn of the Orc Empire to worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, Daniel is only in charge of fighting, and the five emperors are responsible for raising the logistics. It doesn't mean that he doesn't know the difficulties of the empire's logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure on the front line is inevitably transferred to the rear. Because of the many races within the orcs, the share of strategic materials allocated to each race is not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families can't attack their own family members, so they can only transfer the burden originally belonging to their own family members to the subordinate races below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within the same race, there are also nobles and marginal tribes. When distributing shares, it is inevitable that some tribes will suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passed down layer by layer, the marginal tribes who have no right to speak politically bear a burden far beyond their own ability to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pull these nonsense guys out and cut them off, make their heads into wine vessels, display them on the prairie, and warn unruly tribes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some problems are beyond his ability to solve, even if what the middle-aged leopard man said is true, he can't lift the lid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the entire orc empire will be blown apart. Countless tribes will follow suit and resist the unfair food-raising tasks assigned by the above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't solve the problem, you can only solve the person who raised the problem. If you can't see or hear, then you can pretend that nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, after many twists and turns, the countries finally reached an agreement on forming a coalition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this moment, the countries in the Central Continent are already crying, and the scene that once happened in the Northern Continent is re-enacted on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pain of the skin is always the best resonance. It is too late to know the sufferings of the countries in the Northern Continent now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just half a month, the Kingdom of Hesse lost two more provinces, and other countries on the front line also suffered losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What does the Ministry of Military Affairs do for food?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is fought like this, even if you put a group of pigs on it, it is better than you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 250,000 reinforcements sent by the kingdom, plus the 300,000 troops mobilized by the two provinces themselves, ended up collapsing on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for some noble castles who are still resisting, the two provinces in the north of the kingdom have all fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Nicholas, who was being scolded, lowered his head without saying a word. The conscience of heaven and earth, this is really not his responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements sent by the kingdom were recruits improvised, and the troops assembled from the two major provinces were recruited directly, with less than one-tenth of the elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are five or six hundred thousand troops on paper, but in reality who will command them will know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the mob could finish deploying their troops, the enemy came to kill them. As soon as they came into contact in the field, a major defeat occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This defeat brought down the morale, and the defenders everywhere followed suit. The promised reinforcements suddenly disappeared, and the defenders, who were already low in morale, were defeated with lightning speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ministry of Military Affairs cannot be completely blamed for this matter. The enemy did not play their cards according to the routine. After invading the kingdom, they directly shouted the slogan that those who surrender will not be killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battle, the elf army did not slaughter the captives, but released them directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no death threat, and the defenders on the front line have no courage to fight to the death. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Duke of Milton, helped to say a fair word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to investigate these things. Just look at the number of refugees who have poured into the country recently to know whether the enemy has played genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobody wants to die if they can live. The elves combined political means with military means, and the mob on the front line couldn't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Even if you can't win the enemy, you can't lose so fast, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the military will make the kingdom face nothing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, the Alpha Kingdom's tens of thousands of expeditionary forces disabled the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants, and took down an elf army by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peace on the southern front is not given by the enemy, but by the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happiness is set off, and sadness can also be set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both are the top ten kingdoms in the mainland, and they are also \"good\" neighbors. There is no shortage of rivalry between the Kingdom of Hesse and the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, taking advantage of the serious damage to the Alpha Kingdom, it annexed the Counties of Korubia, and the Kingdom of Hesse gained the upper hand in the competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now after this battle, not to mention being beaten back to their original shape, their military weakness has also been exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these annoyances are in the future. The alien coalition must be blocked first, so that the Kingdom of Hesse will have a future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a secret letter. The source of the letter is the elves. The enemy seems to intend to start peace talks.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Krasner's words instantly detonated the audience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves who have the absolute upper hand actually want to negotiate with them, this is simply a fantasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they were playing politics, and their brains reacted quickly. After a short period of distraction, everyone soon came to their senses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the elves are afraid of is not the Hesse Kingdom, but the human race behind the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning two provinces in half a month is very powerful, but if the battle continues, the situation will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the human race have already begun to form, and when they join the war, it will be another situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the Great Plains of Warhammer, the elves have seen the power of the elite human race, but they don't think that all the human race troops are as useless as they are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to promote negotiations, Alexander V was also caught in a tangle. Wars have always been full of two sides. The Kingdom's current losses are indeed very heavy, but it also brings opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harder the foreign race pushes, the more likely his reforms will succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the crisis of life and death, the aristocratic parliament has already made a concession: it agrees to emergency decrees during the war without the approval of the parliament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems a simple one, but it is the dream of all Hesse kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is a gap, it will become bigger and bigger, and the kingship is being strengthened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, you can get in touch with the enemy, the elves are not our real enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their lair is thousands of miles away, even if they take the opportunity to expand, it is impossible to annex so much land in the middle at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are occupied, their population cannot be controlled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the kingdom, there is no gain in fighting against such an enemy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer Earl Backstrom persuaded from the professional field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ambition needs to be supported by strength. The performance of the army on the battlefield has made everyone lose their desire to expand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the performance of the standing army is not bad, but the number of troops is too small. The number of troops expanded in the later stage is there, but the combat effectiveness is very touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the private army of a large number of nobles, it looks like that when they usually work alone. Once they gather to form a coalition army, they will instantly turn into a mob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political system, command system, and logistics system all have serious problems. The Kingdom of Hesse needs to stop and repair its own stubborn illnesses before it can continue on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elves now have the upper hand, and they have put forward a lot of conditions, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a mature monarch, admitting counsel is also a compulsory course. Gritting his teeth and fighting the elves seems to be fun, but the price is the decline of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a few months, the coalition forces of the human race will come, but the enemy can beat them before the coalition forces arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that affected by the previous series of defeats, everyone is also skeptical about whether the Terran coalition can turn things around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the composition of the coalition forces is very complicated. If internal problems affect the combat effectiveness and fail to defeat the enemy, it will really be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elves want to exchange land, they want to link up the alliance of foreign territories!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Marquis Krasner finished speaking, everyone's expressions changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main peace faction and the main war faction were dumbfounded at the same time. It seemed that they were exchanging land, but in fact the consequences were more serious than cutting the land from them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the territories of the foreign race alliance are connected together, the strategic advantage of our human race over the foreign race will no longer exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless ancestors of the human race, the strategic advantage bought with blood cannot be lost in our hands! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nicholas hastily objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the army behaved **** on the battlefield, and he, the Minister of Military Affairs, was also ashamed, but the position of the main combat faction still cannot be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the requirements of the elves are indeed challenging the bottom line of the kingdom. Once a compromise is chosen, life will be difficult for the Kingdom of Hesse in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Nicholas, please remain rational. But as long as the military's performance is a little bit better, we can resolutely reject the enemy's unreasonable demands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the current situation, as everyone has seen, the Kingdom's army is on the verge of collapse on the battlefield. In less than half a month, two more provinces were lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this speed, in less than two months, we will start the battle to defend the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is not afraid of war, but does the kingdom have soldiers available now? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Backstrom retorted with reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars must be fought by people after all. The main force of the kingdom is held back by the stone people, and the improvised mob can't stop the elf army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every day the war lasts, the Kingdom of Hesse has to pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elves want peace talks, so they won't just contact our family, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from their strategic intentions, it is useless for our family to agree. It also requires the cooperation of the countries in the mainland, at least the support of the Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Bank. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Milton analyzed calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He supported the negotiation, but the Hesse Kingdom family could not bear the blame of allowing the alien races to unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Prime Minister is right, the elves will not only look for our family for such a big matter of land exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I brought the letter here. If you are interested, everyone can read it. In the letter, the elf put harsh words directly, whoever opposed this proposal would be destroyed first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Marquis Krasner took out the letter and handed it to everyone for circulation.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Only at this moment did everyone understand why the Minister of Foreign Affairs asked them to see it for themselves instead of directly reporting it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Land exchange\" is only one of the conditions. Apart from this most intolerable requirement, there are a series of additional conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including a series of requirements such as war reparations, arms limitation, and opening of the arms trade ban, each of which is a loss of power and humiliation of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, the elves are so open-mouthed, everyone should reject it straight away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is just the opposite, the more the enemy asks for a higher price, the more hesitant everyone is. There is no way, the elves are too confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you refuse, the Kingdom of Hesse will soon usher in a war of annihilation. It involves the life and death of the kingdom and the fate of each family, and no one dares to make a decision lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we become the key attack target of the elves, how long can the kingdom last? Is it possible to hold on until the reinforcements from the alliance arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of elves was exporting to all countries in the central mainland. They only took a quarter of the firepower, and the front line collapsed all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy adjusts his offensive strategy, shifts from an all-out attack to a focused attack, and devotes most of his troops to the Kingdom of Hesse, the situation will change immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if there is no Stoneman, we might try it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current bad situation, even if the enemy does not increase their troops, the kingdom may not last long. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nicholas' responsible words directly shattered all the illusions of Alexander V, and the atmosphere in the hall became more and more depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the recognized strength levels of the mainland, the strength of the elves is benchmarked against the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that there was an orc empire in this echelon. It's just that the orc was too active, and fell to the second echelon after being beaten hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this level are the Kingdom of Iberia, the Kingdom of the Dwarves, and the Kingdom of Alpha when it was still alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other seven kingdoms of the human race, including the Kingdom of Hesse, and several alien forces all belong to the third echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only based on past records and everyone's strength on paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the same echelon, the respective strength gaps are also very large, and they are changing at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: after the last orc invasion, the Alpha Kingdom fell to the third echelon, and the Warhammer Kingdom slipped to the fourth echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The declining Kingdom of Oprus, Avalat, and Ruthenia were classified into the third echelon only because of their large size and comprehensive strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of military strength alone, it has already fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse is very embarrassing now, or in other words, the three major kingdoms in the middle mainland are quite embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the record, they are not only completely incomparable with the Alpha Kingdom next door, but also incomparable with the alien races in the third echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Hesse Kingdom as an example, when attacking the stone people, they led a group of younger brothers to play gang fights, but the result was more losses than losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who know the inside story know that this is an opportunity to consume the vassal power; those who don't know think they are also lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that they have been beaten up by the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, the outside world is even more suspicious of their strength. The reason why the elf lions opened their mouths was because they were too weak on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay for the cannon fodder troops to perform poorly. The dozen or so main armies that have entered the battlefield have not achieved what they should.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being demoralized by pig teammates can be used as an excuse to defeat a battle, but it cannot gain the enemy's recognition of their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Respect is only based on strength, but as long as they perform better on the battlefield, it is impossible for the elves to make so many unreasonable demands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contact the elves first. It's best if you can negotiate. If you can't agree, you can delay the time first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, at this time, the kingdom cannot advance aggressively and become the key target of the foreign army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best to coordinate the relationship so that the Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Bank are consistent with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, we can pass the news to the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See, urging them to send reinforcements quickly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Milton said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to fully accept the enemy's demands. No one dares to sign such a treaty that humiliates the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is even worse to directly refuse, it is more serious than losing power and humiliating the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, delaying time on the grounds of negotiation has become the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really can't figure it out, then drag your allies into the water together. If one family can't afford the political consequences of compromising with other races, then more families can share the burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for using compromise with aliens as a bargaining chip to threaten the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom to send troops to rescue, Duke Milton is not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risk is too great. While exerting pressure, it is also possible to send yourself to the point of no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, times have changed. The Frankish Kingdom, which had pulled out the nail of the orc, and the revived Holy See are now sharpening their swords, trying to expand their power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attacking alien races is enough. Annexation within the human race world is not that simple. Without a suitable excuse, countries may interfere at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using compromise with other races as a bargaining chip to threaten, there is a high probability that it will be counterproductive. Maybe what the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See hope to see most now is: they compromise with the alien race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the big hat of \"selling the interests of the human race\" is deducted, it can crush the Kingdom of Hesse. Such a stain, even if the matter has passed ten or eight years, people can still turn over the old score.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to compromise with the elves, you have to learn from the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi, both of which signed secret agreements with the elves in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to cover the existence of the secret agreement, the Principality of Moxi is now fighting fake battles with the elf army on the border every day. Around the border city, it's up for grabs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides have agreed on a time, one, three, five, you control, two, four, six, I control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prove the intensity of the battle, the magic crystal cannons of both sides kept ringing from time to time, and the sound of artillery fire could be heard in a radius of dozens of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make the effect more realistic, there are often dead actors on stage, and the main focus is a profession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just do what the prime minister says!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said with a bitter face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ambitions before the war are all in vain at this moment. Now his mind is full of only one idea - \"reform\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the three strongest kingdoms among the human race have undergone political reforms in the past hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse did not follow up. It was because both the reforms of Charles I of the Frankish Kingdom and the dynastic wars of the Kingdom of Iberia killed a lot of people during the reform process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only place where the reform went smoothly was the Alpha Kingdom. The orcs' butcher knives were on everyone's necks, and their heads were about to fall, so there was really no time for infighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality of Moxi, which was successfully reformed later, was also forced to carry out internal reforms when the orcs approached the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all cases of successful reforms, but more reforms have ended in failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three declining kingdoms all fell down quickly because of the failure of internal reforms and the counterattack of interest groups, which caused the authority of the central government to be damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, what are you still doing, throw stones!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Difficulty has to wait for the enemy...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the ogre officer could finish his reprimand, several soldiers in front of him fell down. Taking a closer look, the eyes of the middle-aged ogre became moist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when these soldiers were shot by the arrows. Just now they continued to fight with tenacious willpower, but now they finally couldn't hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes happen every day on the battlefield. The human race may tolerate the existence of other alien races, but it is absolutely impossible to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the racial name \"cannibals\", you know how much hatred they have. In order to reflect the endless hatred, the human race also deliberately added the word \"devil\" to their race name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with emotions, it is purely a struggle for survival. If an ogre wants to activate its cultivation talent, it must devour human flesh and blood; if it wants to practice magic, it must devour human souls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Proper natural enemies of mankind, if they are allowed to live in the world, it will be a blasphemy to all members of the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since humans have become the overlord of the mainland, the ogre family will naturally suffer the most vicious beating. As soon as the continental war started, their end would come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Iberia led a group of younger brothers and launched the cruelest war against them. The slogans shouted by people are \"clean up the garbage for the world, and exterminate the ogres\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether you surrender or not. The enemy just wants to kill all the ogres. Even if they promise again and again: they will not eat human flesh or swallow human souls, it will have no effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Potential threats must be eliminated. The Human Race Alliance has issued a genocide order, and anyone who dares to show mercy to their subordinates will be punished as treason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under high pressure, there must be backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ogre, who was driven to a desperate situation, could only fight the human race in his own way to the end. Both sides are fighting for race, there is no right or wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Adjust the angle of the magic crystal cannon and aim at the buildings in the city.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Magic crossbow, salvo!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic technology has changed the mode of warfare. With the help of long-range fire suppression, as the siege side, the loss is actually smaller than that of the defending side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, one of the most important reasons for this is that the human race is powerful, and the difficulty for ogres to obtain the flesh and blood soul of the human race has greatly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many ogres, from birth to death, had no chance to develop their cultivation talents, and could only be reduced to the bottom of the clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom, boom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a loud noise, the overwhelmed city wall finally fell down. Countless ogres were buried directly under the rocks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ogre clan whose civilization was in the tribal era was able to build such a royal city, and the alien alliance also contributed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this royal city did not bring glory to the ogre clan. Instead, ten years after its completion, it ushered in a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless human soldiers rushed into the city through the gap, and fought with the ogre soldiers defending the city. Behind them there is a steady stream of human troops pouring into the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ogre soldiers who had gathered in a hurry were quickly dispersed by the human army, and then fell into a pool of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every street, every alley, and every building, the two sides have to compete fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle lasted until the seventeenth day after the city was broken, and the ogre defenders were completely wiped out before the curtain came to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, the ogre king's city was full of broken arms and limbs. In the entire continental war, there was no place where the battle was so fierce, and it was a proper flesh and blood grinder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the battle report, King Bordeaux VIII was silent. This victory came too heavy, an ogre king city swallowed the lives of 800,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Ogre has only one royal city. If there are more, the battle will be impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the casualties were contributed by the younger brothers, the war has continued so far, and the Kingdom of Iberia still lost 400,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The race of immortality does not end after winning a royal city, and the next battle of drilling the ravine will only last longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A heavy-loss victory is also a victory. It is also exciting news for the entire continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countries don't care about the casualties of the Kingdom of Iberia, as long as everyone knows that the Terrans won. The main battlefield has been won, and the follow-up mopping up battle can be done slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are afraid of trouble, you can also join the mercenary and slave hunting team. These are professional teams, and they are more slippery than the regular army in finishing work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the fall of the ogre king's city, the human race has won a complete victory in the southern continent, and the only remaining alien race is the dwarf kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, geographically, most of the Dwarf Kingdom's territory is in the Central Continent, but the Holy See, which is at war with them, is considered by the outside world to be the power of the Southern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good news came out, which directly stimulated the major battlefields in the mainland. Hudson, who was far away in the depths of the prairie, smiled when he received the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hard bone of the ogre was gnawed down by the Kingdom of Iberia, and the probability of the human race winning the continental war increased invisibly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the two sides has increased and decreased, and now it is the headache of the alien alliance. Hudson was very much looking forward to the expressions of the three elf queens receiving the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves have been paddling, and finally participated in a continental war, and the situation showed signs of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom, the Kingdom of Iberia has also freed up part of its forces, and the main force of the Continental Allied Forces already exists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimating the elves at this moment, they have already begun to think about how they will end up next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either destroy the countries in the Central Mainland in one go, gamble all the chips, and fight a war with the human race to determine the hegemony of the mainland; or find an opportunity to accept it and wait for the opportunity to end the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same trouble, the orc empire also exists. Once the human race wins a big victory, will there be any good fruits for them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the scout brigade set up a beacon tower in the opposite direction of the army, and wait for my order.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"For specific standards, just refer to the enemy's beacon tower settings. Don't make it too good.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beacon beacons are also exquisite, and the beacon towers that the Orc Empire hastily launched are undoubtedly the lowest-end ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the previous battle, Hudson also saw that orc soldiers used the wrong material. It was supposed to make smoke, but it turned into raging fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also sending a message, but the smoke of the wolf can be clearly seen dozens of miles away, and the flame can travel a few miles at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's best if you don't need to use one move at leisure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that the next journey back home would not be peaceful. The sudden situation has increased the pressure on the Orc Empire, and they will definitely take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the mainland is gradually becoming unfavorable to the Alien Alliance, but as long as they can defeat the Alpha Kingdom, everything can be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side occupies the northern continent, the other occupies the southern continent, and the competition revolves around the central continent. It is easy to form a pattern of confrontation between the north and the south.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

To meet them on the vast prairie is no less difficult than finding a needle in a haystack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After entering the prairie for such a long time, the orc tribes destroyed by the expeditionary army reached three digits, and they did not encounter a single Beamon tribe, let alone a large Beamon tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson thought that the Beamon tribe was still in the Qiulin Mountains and had not yet returned to the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luring the enemy\" definitely does not exist. Take a Beamon tribe with tens of thousands of people as bait, unless Emperor Beamon's brain is flooded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order will go on, the army will bury the pot to make food, and go out to eat this Bimon tribe in two hours!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meat delivered to the door is not free.

The power vacuum left by the fall of a royal family cannot be filled in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families can suppress many vassal races. Apart from their own strength, the most important reason is \"psychological advantage\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past countless years, the five royal families ruled the orc empire, and most of the internal conflicts occurred because they fought each other. Everyone was used to this pattern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the royal family falls, the perception that everyone is accustomed to will change. It is only a matter of course for the powerful races below to have the idea of ​​​​replacing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hundred and fifty miles away, Duke Daniel, who had been tracking the expeditionary army, had a gloomy and terrifying face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In their own lair, they were not able to locate the expeditionary army in time, which was completely unimaginable in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, as long as the human army dared to enter the prairie, they would soon be wiped out by the nearby orc tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of me directly reflects the weakening of the orc empire's control over the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The encirclement and suppression has been going on until now, and the army in the hands of Duke Daniel has expanded from 50,000 to 200,000. However, if the exact position of the enemy army cannot be captured in time, no amount of troops will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time went by, the pressure on Duke Daniel also increased day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After more than a month of failed arrests, voices of doubt in the military gradually increased. Fortunately, the enemy is the fierce Hudson, otherwise everyone would doubt his ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having many soldiers and many generals is sometimes a burden. The orc empire is no longer at its peak, and it simply cannot afford to support 200,000 cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the 200,000 troops gathered, there were only 100,000 cavalry, 50,000 of which were brought back by Daniel, and the rest were infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie of Yimapingchuan, using infantry to encircle and suppress cavalry, you can see how unreliable it is when you think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this scene still happened. It wasn't because the orcs were mentally ill. It was because many tribes had suffered heavy losses, and now they couldn't get as many cavalry as required in the recruiting amount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the 50,000 cavalry sent by various tribes were just putting gold on their faces. The difference between them and infantry was that they had more mounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is the fault of the last war. The human army drove the orcs into the backcountry, without lush aquatic plants, and everyone was forced to reduce the number of livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orc army came back, everyone expanded the scale of livestock breeding, but it took time to settle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of war beasts with crooked melons and dates could not be used as mounts in the past, and they were also pulled out to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry is poor quality and infantry is even worse. The few elites were all recruited to the front line, and the old and young stayed behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel once wanted to disband the army, and take 50,000 cavalry to chase the enemy. It's just a voice deep inside telling him that he can't do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fifty thousand orc cavalry VS 35,000 human cavalry seems to have an advantage, but the enemy is a super elite capable of defeating the Ancient Remnant Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy pushed back, it would be embarrassing. Once defeated, the Orc Empire will become more passive strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the fire is burning in the west!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reminder from the guard officer pulled Daniel back from his contemplation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to send ten Hawkman reconnaissance teams to check what happened to the west from different directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the cavalry unit and get ready to move out! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the distance between the two armies has narrowed, Eagle scouts have become the most dangerous profession. It's good that no trace of the enemy army is found, once found, very few of them can come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task that could have been completed by two or three Yingmen, now requires at least dozens of Yingmen to act together to have a chance to send the message back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This probability mainly depends on the mood of Maxim and Bear Stearns. If these two sanctuaries make a move, they will be given the group destruction package directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the probability of encountering them directly is not high. The expeditionary force often disperses their activities, as long as they avoid the pursuit of the Griffon Dragoons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The location is found, and the news is also lagging. Expeditionary regiments are constantly moving on the grasslands and rarely stay in the same area for more than two days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the clouds, looking down at the fight below, Hudson's heart has no waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since commanding the cavalry, he has fallen in love with this kind of field raid. A careful study of the expeditionary army's battles on the grasslands will reveal that as long as there are orc tribes migrating, they will definitely pounce on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc tribe is stationed in a dangerous area and has perfect fortifications, the expeditionary army will usually leave directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that on the orc prairie, there are too few such dangerous areas, and more of them are plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is such a treasure land, the orc tribe who just migrated from the rear has no time to build fortifications, or there is no need to build fortifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even among the orc farming tribes, no one built castles. Putting up a few rows of fences to defend against wild animals is considered their fortification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production mode of slash-and-burn farming is completely dependent on the weather, and the level of agricultural production is far below that of human beings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, the ability of human beings to overthrow the rule of the orcs and become the new overlord of the continent is essentially a victory for civilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Excellent fertility + cutting-edge productivity of the times give human beings an advantage in the competition with other races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the confrontation below, we can see that facing the attack of the human cavalry, many Behemoths picked up wooden sticks covered with bone spurs and came out to meet the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spears on the grassland are divided into bone spears and iron spears. The former is a bone spur on a wooden stick, and the latter is a normal spear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in order to save costs, the spears used by orcs have shorter iron parts at the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The offensive weapons are so economical, and armor and other equipment are even more hopeless. Owning a pair of leather armor is the treatment of an elite soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the use of crossbow arrows, it was a **** fight. The Beamon tribe, whose main force is absent, is not worth the precious arrows used by the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this vast prairie, the army cannot obtain supplies, consumable weapons such as arrows, that is one less one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was in a hurry to take the troops back, and a large part of the reason was that the ordnance was too expensive. The spare weapons are almost exhausted, and if the fight continues, the soldiers below will not be able to guarantee a single knight gun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crying, screaming, and fighting were mixed together, and the world was full of sadness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"May there be no war in the world!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Muttered to himself, the bowstring in Hudson's hand had been loosened, and there was a \"swish\" sound, and the arrow had already aimed at a Beamon priest and flew over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to casting magic, it is more economical to play the role of \"Knight of the Bow\", just like exercising your muscles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time he makes a shot, Hudson picks out the important figures of the enemy to shoot, and the arrow kills the **** of death on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Maxim and Bear Stearns, as the powerhouses in the sanctuary, they have to maintain their identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally sneak attack, hit the sidelines, as long as the word is silenced in time to prevent the news from getting out. Every time they end up fighting, it would be too much hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The behemoths who took the lead were hit by arrows one after another. Only a powerful old man noticed something was wrong in advance and took precautions, and he managed to escape the fatal injury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Despicable, the arrow has...poison...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Struggling, just finished speaking, the old man Bimon died directly. It wasn't that the poison was onset quickly, but that the nearby human cavalry gave him another shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poison that can kill an eighth-level priest immediately is very valuable in Aslante. Hudson is not a professional poisoner, so naturally he can't match it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it doesn't matter, as a necromancer, adding negative energy such as curse to the arrow has the same effect as poison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the old man's body began to rot, and the skeleton began to transform into an undead creature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has long been familiar with the strangeness. Transforming the dead orcs into undead was originally an open secret agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the undead magisters in the kingdom basically came this time. The purpose is to bring a wave of ruthlessness to the orc empire, and to create peace for twenty or thirty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contrary to everyone's perception, due to their own magic power, necromancers are not capable of turning all orc corpses into undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After almost every task, Hudson will complete their unfinished \"transformation\". However, he will not come out to claim this credit, and will only record it on the necromancer who accompanied the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon team, which was already in a panic, became even more chaotic after losing command. From the very beginning, the balance of war has been tilted towards the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the news is confirmed. The enemy is attacking a large Beamon tribe, and the two sides are currently fighting fiercely!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this news, Duke Daniel did not hesitate at all, and immediately ordered: \"Send the order, and all the cavalry will attack to rescue the Beamon tribe!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has issued similar orders more than once. It's a pity that every time they arrive at the battlefield, the enemy has already left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon tribe that was attacked this time, Daniel only hoped that they would live up to the name of the royal family and last longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance of one hundred and fifty miles does not take much time for elite cavalry. The battle ahead is still going on, and now is undoubtedly the best time to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army ran all the way, and Duke Daniel couldn't help being excited. The strength of the expeditionary corps, in addition to its own combat effectiveness, is more importantly its high mobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without mobility, even if they pile up human lives, they can be consumed to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Tito, I will rely on you later. If the consecrated group can capture Hudson, you will be the number one hero of the empire!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what his coach said, Tito frowned and almost fell off the monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the military force of the empire, it is natural to have the means to counter the powerhouses in the sanctuary, but the difference between \"competing\" and \"capturing\" is huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-end power of the Orc Empire suffered heavy losses in the last war, and the number of worshipers was directly reduced by more than half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, in order to compete for resources, it is natural to brag, but he didn't expect that people would actually believe it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, I'm afraid this matter needs to be discussed in the long run. The enemy has two powerful sanctuary guards, and wants to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Tito could finish speaking, Daniel interrupted: \"Don't worry, sir, I'm not a pickpocket. If I can't be captured alive, I can be killed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That sincere expression made Tito swallow the words that came to his lips. Being forced into a corner, the next thing I could do was to go all out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the offering group, Daniel's heart was not disturbed. These old guys are usually very airy, and even he, the coach, is not taken seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court continued to put pressure on him, and simply brought a wave of contradictions to divert Dafa. If Hudson is successfully won, everyone will be happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan failed, so he tried his best. The enshrining group is not strong enough, and it can't be blamed on him, the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 100,000 cavalry acted together, and soon divided into two more echelons. The 50,000 elite ran the fastest and rushed to the forefront of the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another 50,000 cavalry is interesting. Except for a few elites who can keep up with the main force in front, the rest of the soldiers are in the lagging mode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from ordinary stragglers, they are organized stragglers based on tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that the attacking direction of these chasing soldiers has slightly deviated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way of marching, a slight loss can make a difference of a thousand miles. It was impossible for the officers not to know, but they did it anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out. Under the high-handed rule of the five royal families, if you want to live a long time, you must learn to preserve your strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are mistaken for \"trash\", the most afraid of being considered powerful by the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Races that deliberately show their strength in front of the boss can indeed gain benefits in a short period of time, but they will soon be \"reused\" and suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Daniel didn't see this scene, otherwise he would have been blown up. Mistakes during the march, delaying the arrival at the battlefield, is a very terrible thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Expeditionary Corps, after shooting two boxes of arrows, once again achieved the achievement of beheading a hundred people, and Hudson also lost the motivation to continue shooting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, a large group of enemy cavalry has appeared in the east, and they are rushing towards us. The distance is estimated to be no more than fifty miles!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this news, Hudson frowned. In recent days, the enemy is also making progress, and the speed of hunting is getting faster and faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the battlefield that was coming to an end, Hudson ordered calmly: \"Send the order, all troops will end the battle as quickly as possible, and then immediately set fire to the granary and slaughter the animals!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The necromancer immediately took action, turning the enemy's corpse into an undead. If time is too late, let these corpses be stained with the poison of the undead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After completing the task, immediately take the corpses of our army and transfer them to the south. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just experienced a **** battle, it is really not suitable to play a decisive battle with the enemy's main force, and can only take advantage of the remnants of Beamon who are fleeing around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Several times in a row, they were all in vain, but this time they caught up with a tail. Could it be the enemy's conspiracy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon he dismissed the idea again. To display conspiracies and tricks, there must be room to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is in the Orc Empire, and there is neither the right time nor the right place, nor the enemy. Even if it is an ambush, the expeditionary army does not have enough troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leave five thousand soldiers and horses to clean up the undead, and the rest follow me to chase the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army had just set off, when the smoke suddenly rose in the sky. Looking in the direction of the smoke, it was clearly the route they had come from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops, the enemy is targeting the infantry corps behind, deliberately leading us over!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send the order down, and the whole army immediately turns around and goes back to rescue the infantry regiment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flustered Duke Daniel hurriedly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry corps in the rear are all improvised mobs, and their combat effectiveness is far inferior to that of the cavalry corps. Once they are attacked by the enemy, the consequences can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, mobs also have value as mobs. One hundred thousand troops are thrown into the battlefield, even if they are used as cannon fodder, they can still play a big role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On one's own territory, failing to take down the infiltrating enemy is already embarrassing enough. If he is swallowed by another 100,000 troops, he, the commander, will be put on the pillar of shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary orcs don't know about it, but Daniel knows it very well. A similar scene had happened on the Great Plains of Warhammer before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic coalition of the ancient survivors was defeated because of lack of experience in dealing with it, and fell into the enemy's tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the clouds, Hudson, who is used to riding a dragon, has no love for galloping horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, your men are about to collide with the enemy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long time, Hudson has played an exhaustive role on the battlefield, and this is the first time that he has made a mistake in judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the direction Maxim pointed out, Hudson didn't see anything. Obviously, the eyesight of humans and dragons is not on the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go and have a look!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marching route was chosen temporarily by him. In order to confuse the enemy, he changed it halfway. It is impossible for the enemy to determine their route in advance and to lay an ambush halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, Hudson breathed a sigh of relief when he appeared above the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are a lot of orc cavalry below, they are obviously not strong enough to deal with the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the marching route, these guys seem to be enemy troops who have seen the smoke and rushed over to support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to previous investigations, apart from the army led by Daniel, there were no other cavalry units nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to understand why the enemy divided up their forces, Hudson simply didn't bother to waste time. With the strength of the expeditionary army, it is not difficult to defeat the enemy in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that after this battle, if you want to go back to clean up the enemy's infantry regiment, you will have no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is fought by surprise. If the enemy is prepared, Hudson will not attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that you can't win, but it's not worth it at all to exchange elites for cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    itself launched this campaign to mobilize the enemy forces, confuse the enemy's sight, make them make strategic misjudgments, and create opportunities for the expeditionary force to withdraw from the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Hudson's command, the two armies met on the prairie in a few moments. When the enemies met each other, they were extremely jealous, and immediately fought together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Expeditionary Corps is nothing but the orcs. Originally, they deliberately took a detour to arrive late just for paddling, but they didn't expect to collide with the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible to leave in full view. A slight deviation from the route on the battlefield and arriving at the destination a few hours late can also be explained as an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you encounter the enemy head-on, if you don't fight a battle, the coach will not be able to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they confronted each other, the monster cavalry rushed into their formation, causing chaos in their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, these orc cavalry had no formation. The so-called cooperation is also limited to the cavalry of the tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it exceeds this limit, don't consider it. Everyone was not familiar with each other, and it was all because of the order of the empire that they were able to gather together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conflicts among the tribes are far deeper than friendship. Because of resource issues, there are very few conflicts between neighboring tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elite VS cannon fodder, from the beginning of the battle, the expeditionary army has the upper hand. Countless orc cavalry were killed before they could adapt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic scene made all the orc chiefs cry secretly. Now they just hope that the reinforcements will come soon, so that the enemies in front of them know that the orcs are not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of Eagles landed just as they took off. I didn't know what happened, so I was sent to see the beast **** in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the Ying people were dumbfounded when they saw it. As a member of the royal family, acting with these vassal races is only for the convenience of communication, not to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Expeditionary Corps entered the prairie, the Day of Good Friday for the Eagle Clan has arrived. Whether it is going out to investigate or pass on information, it has become a high-risk job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In less than two months, nearly Qianying people unfortunately died in the process of carrying out their missions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to save their lives, the Yingman soldiers also learned to be good. As long as it is not a clear task that cannot be refused, the rest will be fished when they can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Often lose the position of the expeditionary legion, a large part of the reason is that the eagle soldiers are afraid of being tossed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only ordinary soldiers suffered heavy casualties, but even two eighth-rank Yingren powerhouses lost their lives during the mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Lemuel, what are you still doing in a daze, send someone to ask for help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tiger chief roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, he would never have dared to speak like that to members of the royal family, but times have changed now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under a series of blows, the strength of the five royal families whose strength has plummeted, it is difficult to continue to adopt high-handed rule over the vassal races below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to fight against the great enemy of the human race, the five royal families had to win over the powerful factions in the empire, and some stronger races gradually gained a certain right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter how fast we are, we can't go as fast as the smoke. I know you don't have smoke, just create some smoke to spread the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the distance, your route has deviated by tens of miles, and Marshal Daniel should be able to receive the news. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lemuel said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally found an excuse to fool the past. It's not easy to be a messenger. If he knew it was so dangerous, he would just stay on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The regiment was full at the time of departure, but now it has lost one-third of its strength, and the morale of the army has long since disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our own tribe suffered heavy losses this time. If the losses continue, they might not be able to escape the fate of being annexed after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc empire, a tribe that has lost a large number of young and strong tribes is not qualified to continue to exist. Once absorbed by other tribes, the best ending for those in power is to become marginal figures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If not, he wouldn't be able to cooperate with the vassal races below. As members of the five royal families, in addition to playing the role of messengers, they are also \"supervisors\" sent by the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tiger chief who reacted didn't bother to pay attention to Lamuer's hidden threats, and hurriedly rushed to the guards in front of him and ordered: \"You guys hurry up and find something, create smoke, and be fast!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eighty miles away, Daniel, who was rushing back with the army, was running wildly, when the voice of the guard suddenly sounded in his ear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, there is smoke!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hurriedly stabilized the mount, turned his head and looked around, Daniel was dumbfounded. There were wolf smoke in all directions, and there were more than ten strands of smoke from what he saw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a split second he knew something was wrong. The enemy is also less likely to split up and attack in multiple directions, and there are not so dense orc tribes nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that the enemy is aware of the threat of the wolf smoke message, and directly plays it as a fake, trying to confuse the line of sight in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sorry to know that doesn't make any sense. Under the dense wolf smoke, no one can accurately judge the real attack direction of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't divide your troops to reinforce multiple directions at the same time, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed down, and the army stops and rests in place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I ordered all the Eagles to go out to investigate. Be sure to find out the location of the enemy. Anyone who violates the law will be killed without mercy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This arrangement will definitely offend the Eagle Court, but there is no way, war always requires someone to sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel didn't want to make any omissions at the crucial moment of fighting wits with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are temporarily at a disadvantage, this is the Orc Empire. No matter how powerful the expeditionary army is, it is impossible to last for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is on their side, as long as the enemy is not allowed to run away. The longer they wait, the better their chances of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel clung to the expeditionary army, not because he was worried that the orc tribe would be killed, but because he was afraid that Hudson would run away with the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being disturbed by the expeditionary army in the country, the loss of the orc empire has been immeasurable. If the enemy cannot be kept, he will have no way to explain to the five emperors above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrow rain flew out again, and countless orc cavalry fell in response. This is already the last arrow reserve of the expeditionary legion. Once it is exhausted, the magic crossbow will become a decoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally prepared for the main force of the orcs, but now for a quick victory, Hudson can only use it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second-rate cavalry is also a cavalry, which is barely enough. If it is used on cannon fodder infantry, it will be a real blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, many orc slaves are not as expensive as a special arrow. It seems that what is shot is a rain of arrows, but what is actually shot is money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of purely handmade, the cost of arrows was not cheap, and the price of arrows specially used for magic crossbows was even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    you get what you pay for. These arrows are expensive, and for a reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary arrows cannot penetrate armor. The high penetrating power of crossbow bolts is based on the premise that the arrows are strong and sharp enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time there is a big war, it costs money like water. One-fifth of the kingdom's financial holes are caused by disposable ordnance consumables such as arrows, knight spears, and throwing spears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are expensive on the battlefield, and the enemy did not send reinforcements immediately, which created opportunities for the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be 35,000 VS 50,000, but in fact, when it comes to some battlefields, the human race has more troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five legion commanders all took office recently, and the longest incumbent took office for less than a time, so he was forced to go to the battlefield before he had time to follow the internal command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander-in-chief was not there, and the prestige of the several legion commanders was not enough. The troops below quickly fought on their own with tribes as units.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiots, get married...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the word \"he\" was spoken, the orc general received the boxed lunch. This was already the seventy-sixth victim on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who patrolled the battlefield, is like the sickle of death. As long as there are orcs standing out, they will be harvested immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tribes fight on their own. The biggest advantage is that they have strong centripetal force and can trust each other with the greatest trust, but the premise is that no accidents will happen to the chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In most of the orc tribes, the chiefs hold the military and political power, and the deputy does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priests who are second only to the status of chieftains are respected, relying more on personal prestige than military command ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of power checks and balances, any rational chief will not allow religious leaders to control the military power of the tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smaller the tribe, the more obvious this situation is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are many priests in the big tribe, and the influence is divided between each other. Only the chief high priest can threaten the power of the chief, and he is not so wary of ordinary priests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of army, which is condensed by the chief's personal charm, often ends with the death of the chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of the shortcomings of the orcs, Hudson became even more excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't consider his identity inappropriate, he would have wanted to train some powerful sharpshooters to target the enemy's tribal chiefs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armies of one tribe after another were defeated, and the number of defeated orcs on the battlefield was increasing sharply at an extraordinary speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scurrying orc rout did not cause any trouble to the expeditionary army, but instead became the last straw that crushed the morale of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The corpses all over the ground kept piling up, and the blood flowed on the prairie, constantly watering the earth. Reflecting the afterglow of the setting sun, the whole world became depressing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the reinforcements were delayed, the orc cavalry, unable to bear the casualties, kept retreating under the attack of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alternate cover, orderly retreat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who gave the order. Anyway, the orc soldiers who heard the voice only had the word \"withdraw\" in their minds, and they all turned around and ran away. No matter how the commander called, they couldn't pull them back to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pandora's Box was opened, and nearby orc soldiers followed. Soon the tide of retreat turned into a tide of rout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alternate cover, orderly retreat\", that is pure idealism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can live, no orc wants to die. From choosing to paddle on the battlefield, all tribes have a consensus - to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of life and death, no one is willing to stay behind. Then you can only compare the speed. As long as you run past your teammates, the enemy will have no time to chase them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc soldiers who reacted quickly became the lucky ones in this war, and quickly left the battlefield successfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will be miserable for the orcs who are belatedly aware. When they evacuate, they just leave their backs to the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chasing down routs and beating dogs in the water will always be everyone's favorite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after two battles today and dozens of miles of raids, everyone's bodies are exhausted, but it's still hard to stop everyone's enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supported by the strength of the spirit, the expeditionary force exploded with unparalleled strength, which shocked the commander-in-chief Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is completely crazy rhythm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was expected to defeat the enemy, but after defeating the enemy, a sudden wave broke out when expanding the results of the battle, which was beyond his expectation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the performance on the battlefield, the expeditionary army seems to have created a military soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many powerful armies in history, but there are very few troops that can give birth to military spirits. Any army with a military soul is the pinnacle of the era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to create a military soul, no one can answer this topic. Some troops forged military spirits through continuous victories and directly stepped onto the altar; there were also troops who persevered in failure and gave birth to military spirits, and finally completed the counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each army that is born with a military soul is unique, and it is difficult to replicate it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking down at the battlefield, countless fleeing orc soldiers sacrificed their lives for the sublimation sacrifice of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing, killing as much as you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not until the sky gradually dimmed that Hudson ordered Mingjin to withdraw his troops. The battlefield at this moment is already littered with corpses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No statistics were made, but judging from the situation on the battlefield, Hudson can be sure that the orc army suffered no less than 30,000 casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the field battle of the cavalry, it can be called a miracle to be able to kill 60% of the enemy's troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually this kind of record will only appear when the two sides are deadlocked, or when one side surrounds the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, if you can't beat the enemy, can you still outrun your teammates?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the vast prairie, as long as the side with more troops wants to escape, most of the soldiers can escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As night fell, Daniel finally received the news from the expeditionary army, but it came too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he knew that the battlefield was less than a hundred miles away, he would have brought his troops there to reinforce, and it would not have caused the current tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fifty thousand cavalrymen were defeated by the enemy just under his nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific losses will not be available for a while, but the mental state of the soldiers who escaped by chance has collapsed. It is obvious that this is due to a major stimulus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he didn't appear on the battlefield, Daniel could still guess how tragic the battle was. If it wasn't for the darkening weather, it would be difficult to find the exact location of the enemy army, and he wished he could lead his troops to take revenge immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, his dissatisfaction with Yingren has also accumulated to the limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for these guys who were greedy for life and afraid of death, and didn't pass the information back in time, they wouldn't be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeated soldiers have no morale, and their combat effectiveness is about zero. This meant that in a short period of time, he had lost 50,000 cavalry, even if it was only the second-line cavalry, it was enough to cause him pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising troops, mobilizing troops, losing troops and destroying generals, but not even a decent record. Daniel is also under a lot of pressure. At this moment, he has no idea how to explain to the emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shake it off?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not his style. What's more, except for him, the coach, no one can carry the blame now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to call the five legion commanders over for a meeting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After a quick march of hundreds of miles, no trace of the enemy was found, so Hudson ordered to set up camp and rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle during the day was completely an accident. Hudson still hasn't figured out why the enemy hits his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is a miracle in military history, and there are many similar coincidences in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, if everyone does not make mistakes in the war, there will be no classic battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The climate on the prairie is changeable, and the temperature difference between day and night is very large, so keeping warm is extremely important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After setting up the tent, Hudson immediately called a meeting of senior military officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The daytime battle was won beautifully, but our strategic goal was also exposed in advance, and all original plans were cancelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation on the battlefield, the enemy is not an idler. After entangled with us for such a long time, a flaw was exposed once, and I don't know when the next time will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic goal of the Expeditionary Corps going deep into the prairie to create chaos and reduce the enemy's war potential has been overfulfilled. There is no need to stay and waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of the army, I decided to withdraw the troops tomorrow and return to the kingdom to rest. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly plain words fell into everyone's ears like a thunderbolt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has heard the news of the retreat before, but the situation is different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After eating the enemy's 50,000 cavalry, the balance of strength between the two sides has changed. Even if the enemy gathers the rout, there is no absolute strength to suppress the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the 100,000 infantry, they were ignored by everyone. When the cavalry fights, it's their turn to blend in there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's past style, when encountering this kind of opportunity, how can he not give up without killing the enemy, and it is obviously too early to retreat now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, there are only 100,000 cavalry in the enemy's encirclement and suppression of us, and half of them have been destroyed during the day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we get rid of the other 50,000 cavalry, we can smash the enemy's encirclement and suppression plan and eat up the 200,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this force, the orcs would have to withdraw from the front line. At that time, we will attack back and forth, and we have every chance to hit the Orc Empire again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everything goes well, the great cause of destroying the orc empire may come true in our hands! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of Earl Ebert's army said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destroying the orc empire is the common wish of all Alpha Kingdom soldiers, and many of them regard this as their lifelong pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The consecutive victories of the expeditionary legion tore up the last worries in everyone's hearts, and everyone's appetite has swelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expectation deep in my heart, from the initial resistance to the orc invasion, to the subsequent defeat of the orc army, to the current destruction of the orc empire, is a big \"sublimation\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, Ebert is right, the opportunity is rare!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the Marquis Medel army hastily echoed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, all the officers also spoke, as if the enemy was already meat on the chopping board and could be slaughtered by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your ideas are very good. If this plan is implemented, the kingdom does have a chance to destroy the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that not only kingdoms and orcs, but also many powerful forces rule the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the kingdom, even if the orc empire can be destroyed, it will inevitably suffer serious damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Optimistically, we will lose 70% of our military power and make wedding dresses for others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's explanation made everyone's face change drastically again, and everyone became eggplants beaten by frost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The destruction of the orc empire was after all just a beautiful dream. With the comprehensive national strength of the Alpha Kingdom, forcing this plan will only choke him to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the kingdom has the upper hand on the battlefield, but the overall military strength is still dominated by the orcs, otherwise there would be no military adventure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The national strength is too weak to eat such a big cake. If we continue to fight the orc empire, it will only benefit the fishermen who are watching the show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of interests, the relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the Seven Prairie Kingdoms is not very good. Their restoration on the prairie would be a political disaster for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the strength of the orcs is still strong, keeping them will be a disaster sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they recover, the northern border of the kingdom will be threatened again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we can't destroy them now, we can still injure them so that they don't get bigger again! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Ebert fought hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he only saw the first layer of the problem: the threat of the orcs to the kingdom; but he didn't see the second layer: the Alpha Kingdom now needs the threat of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Born in sorrow and died in peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the threat of the orcs that allowed the major factions in the Alpha Kingdom to maintain maximum restraint and maintain internal unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this threat is removed, future political struggles will not be as mild as they are now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the cases of political struggles abroad, we know that every time there is a major political reshuffle, countless aristocratic families who stand on the wrong side will decline as a result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a new great aristocrat, Hudson's influence is almost entirely concentrated in the military, and has not yet had time to extend politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the internal struggle in the kingdom escalates, Hudson, who gets a big piece of cake, will easily fall into the target of public criticism and become the first unlucky one to be out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, it is particularly important to \"raise the bandits' self-respect\". As long as there is a threat from foreign enemies, he will always be the most noble marshal of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the internal political struggle of the court, Hudson, who has a detached position, can completely remain neutral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the major factions are not stupid, they will not provoke him. A few more years of neutrality, nobles who also want to be neutral will naturally move closer to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, Hudson will definitely obtain a large area of ​​fiefdom on the front line of northern Xinjiang after the war. There is no need to fight for it, and someone will automatically send it to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where is the most important strategic place to defend against the invasion of orcs, that is his fiefdom. The errand of the kingdom's goalkeeper fell 100% on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the establishment of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, which made everyone mistakenly think that there was no threat to northern Xinjiang, Hudson's fiefdom should have fallen on the land of northern Xinjiang last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the kingdom's tradition. The most capable generals are canonized to the places where they are most needed. Only then has the current military structure of the North being strong and the South being weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, don't be impulsive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy didn't come after them, which already explained a lot of problems. Hundreds of thousands of troops gathered together, do you still want to attack by force?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being out for so long, our ordnance has been exhausted, especially the special arrows, which are only enough for three salvos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things should be kept in case of accidents. The enemy has suffered such a big loss, and it is impossible not to respond. Our return journey may not be smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight the orcs, there are plenty of opportunities in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have made a decision to retreat tomorrow, what you have to do now is to execute the order! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, a military meeting was also held in the camp of the orc army. The difference lies in the morale of both sides, which are completely two extremes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the expeditionary army clamoring to expand the results of the battle, the faces of all the orc officers were gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A total of 50,000 cavalry were wiped out at once. Up to now, the number of routs gathered is less than 3,000, which is no less than a bolt from the blue to a group of orc generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel was even more angry. If it wasn't for these guys running around, he wouldn't have bumped into the enemy head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to be held accountable, but could not find the \"beast\". According to the account of the defeated soldiers, all the commanders of the five major armies were killed in battle, and the whereabouts of the general Yingren who also served as the supervisor of the battle is also unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no one who can be found who is responsible for the weight. The responsibility for the defeat will undoubtedly fall on him, the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How to fight next, what do you think, let's talk about it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel's question shocked all the orc officers. They all opened their eyes wide, looking at their own commander with suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are familiar with Daniel know that his ability to use soldiers is directly proportional to his arrogance. There are no generals who can catch his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when military meetings were held, Daniel was responsible for giving orders, and everyone was responsible for carrying them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to put forward an opinion, but there is a high probability that it will be sprayed with blood, as if everyone's plan is **** in his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After following for a long time, everyone stopped raising opinions. Anyway, when it comes to military literacy, there is indeed a huge gap with his own commander, and there is nothing controversial about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrogant commander suddenly asked everyone for advice. The sudden change made the generals very unaccustomed to it, and some generals even doubted whether the commander in front of him had changed his \"core\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things are not without precedent in the continent of Aslante. Especially in court internal strife, the use of evil methods to play Li Daitao's stiffness occurs most frequently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these gameplays have obvious shortcomings. A foreign soul and body cannot fit together perfectly, and flaws are easily exposed in words and deeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that no problems were found, a lion general said slowly: \"Marshal, the enemy is very cunning, we can no longer be led by the nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past battles, Hudson is particularly good at using troops by surprise. He tossed and abolished the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants, and the Empire also suffered a lot from him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't think of a way to deal with him for a while. But what is certain is that we can no longer divide our forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the situation changes, we cannot divide our forces. Otherwise, it is very likely to repeat the tragedy of the alliance of the ancient survivors! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, all the generals echoed. In the blink of an eye, \"no division of troops\" became the consensus of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just fell into the ears of Duke Daniel. These suggestions are nothing but a bunch of nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Unable to divide the troops\" is just their behavior, and has nothing to do with how to defeat the expeditionary army. Enemies are not fools, it is enough to wreak havoc everywhere, there is no need to run to fight them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being dragged down by the infantry, it became a fantasy to chase the enemy next. Even if the enemy runs slowly, it is faster than infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the encircling and suppressing army fell into a dilemma. Dividing the troops threatens to destroy them, and concentrating the troops but not being able to catch up with the enemy forces is \"embarrassing\" in capital letters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, why don't you report it to the imperial court!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is recognized by the empire as the number one general on the mainland, and it is understandable that he could not take down the enemy army led by him for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to others, our performance is pretty good. At least we have kept the main force and the vitality of the imperial court. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    General Bimon on the side spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't win, then you're better off. Anyway, there are a lot of great people who have suffered defeats at the hands of Hudson. If the responsibility is pursued, most of the five emperors are \"sinners\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the comparison of Hudson's previous record, the encirclement and suppression army only lost tens of thousands of second-rate cavalry, and this wave of performance is definitely qualified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Daniel nodded. Usually he just disdains to play these little tricks with arrogance, but it doesn't mean that his political level has really returned to zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeat in the contest with Hudson was mainly due to the emptiness within the Orc Empire, and the attacked tribe failed to buy time for rescue. But if there are more troops left behind in the tribe, the enemy will definitely not be able to come and go as freely as they are now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the troops under his command hadn't changed the marching route without authorization, according to Duke Daniel's deployment, the cavalry would have met halfway, and there would have been no such defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let's do this first! Pass the news to the nearby tribes and ask them to step up their guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dig more horse pits and set up more horse rejection posts around the tribal camp. No matter day or night, there must be enough patrol soldiers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel asked helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to determine the movement of the expeditionary army, he could only passively take defensive measures to minimize the losses of the tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but deep in my heart, there is always a voice constantly reminding him: such a passive defense is wrong, the enemy will not be so stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wonderful misunderstanding bought enough time for the expeditionary force to withdraw. While the enemy was still preparing for their harm to the nearby orc tribes, the expeditionary legion had already traveled hundreds of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Constrained by inconvenient communication and the numerous tribes within the Orc Empire, it was already the third day when the expeditionary force was exposed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a distance of hundreds of miles, the encirclement and suppression army, who dared not divide their troops to pursue, could only report the news to the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A strange scene appeared. The five emperors who received the news cursed one after another, but no one took the initiative to take on the important task of destroying the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Beamon, your Beamon cavalry is unparalleled in the world. Why don't you lead the team for this mission?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Xiongrenhuang finished speaking, Alex stood up from his seat, and bullying Beamon would not be treated like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Bimon cavalry is unparalleled in the world, so it depends on who you compare it with. When they met the old enemy Hudson, when did they win?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Xiong, stop joking. It is true that the Beamon cavalry is unparalleled in the world, but we suffered heavy losses in the previous wars!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court went into battle regardless of men and women. Now they can't gather three legions, and there is another legion in the rear to encircle and suppress the enemy. It is really difficult to take on this important task with limited troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think His Majesty the Wolf Emperor should take more care and use the invincible wolf cavalry to keep all the enemies on the prairie! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Emperor Bimeng's blame, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor exploded immediately. The number of wolf cavalry is indeed more, but it is not enough to easily eat the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the practice of the orc empire, whichever emperor commands the troops, the royal family will act as the main force. In the eyes of the emperors, the important task of intercepting the expeditionary army is a proper chore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Emperor Bimon is overrated. The wolf cavalry is good, but there is still a certain distance from the top cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Silver Moon Royal Court has played against Hudson many times, but they all ended in failure. First of all, their morale is three points lower, so it is really difficult to take on this important task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think Lion King should take more care of it. Among the five imperial courts, the nobles are the most well-preserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish speaking, the Lion Emperor hurriedly retorted: \"Your Majesty the Wolf Emperor, you can't say that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our loss is also very heavy, and now it is only a good appearance, this matter...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After looking around for a week, the Lion King couldn't find a good one to dump.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Eagle Terrans are mainly based on the air force. They were heavily attacked by the Terran Allied Forces in the last war, and now they often play the role of collecting intelligence and delivering news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can't even gather a full cavalry regiment, so let them lead a large army to intercept the expeditionary regiment, that is really embarrassing for \"Eagle Man\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Xiong Renhuang on the side kept shaking his head, his expression was clearly saying: There is no way to get rid of the blame!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the bear people is indeed strong, but they don't have cavalry! Sending infantry out to stop the enemy's cavalry regiment is a proper way to give away the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five emperors didn't want to take on this high-risk, low-return hard task, and the situation suddenly stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone doesn't want to do it, so let's send troops together! Anyway, the enemy has turned our country upside down, so we can't let them escape easily!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor suggested with a little embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evacuation went smoothly all the way, and when the front line where the two armies were fighting was approaching, the expeditionary corps felt a little bit of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this feeling of uneasiness quickly disappeared. The border between the two countries stretches for thousands of miles, how to intercept it is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, do you want to detour?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Defeating the orc army in the field would not kill the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, to recover the lost ground, the orc army must be defeated sooner or later. This battle is doomed to be inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't panic, but the orc army on the opposite side panicked. Although the five imperial courts have repeatedly blocked the news, the special system of the orc empire determines that they can only block one loneliness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that happened in the country have long been spread in the military camps through various \"gossip\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reduced ration quota further confirmed the rumors. The more the top management denies it, the more people believe the rumors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is \"gossip\", it is inevitable to use exaggeration. In the eyes of many orc soldiers, the Expeditionary Legion is the devil from hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such thing as taking the initiative to attack. They are an infantry regiment, so it is impossible for infantry to chase down cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bewildered orc officer decisively chose to report the news to the imperial court, and the hot potato returned to the hands of the five emperors again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At midnight, the tents in the imperial court were still brightly lit. The five emperors held a high-level meeting, but no matter how much they discussed, they still couldn't come up with effective measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now to send troops to intercept, not only the strength of the expeditionary army must be considered, but also the human army on the opposite side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These unreliable assumptions, there is no need to fantasize now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the supreme commander of the Alpha Kingdom's army. He only needs one order to mobilize the defenders in the pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When we send troops to encircle and wipe out the expeditionary army, the enemy's defenders in the pass will definitely take action, and there is no possibility of sitting on the sidelines! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon Emperor Alex said tiredly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I was fooled by the war. Now that these generals are making suggestions, they are all starting to have hallucinations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed possible to sit back and watch the friendly army be surrounded by the enemy, but that is in the Orc Empire. Because of conflicts between races and tribes, it often happens that teammates are cheated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom with a single race is different. Even if someone wants to cheat his teammates, he dare not go too far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received the rescue order, but also sit back and watch friendly troops be annihilated by the enemy, such a crime, no matter how hard the background is, it cannot be covered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fantasy was shattered, and all the generals fell silent. Hudson put too much pressure on them, and no one was sure about the actual operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We have too few mobile cavalry to use, and it is difficult to take down the enemy's expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the most cunning in using troops. He has set up camp at the current location, and he is afraid that he has set up a trap for us to drill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, it only took a few hours for the enemy cavalry in the pass to come out to meet them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a distance, they just cross the border directly. The little troops we deployed alone can't stop them from breaking through!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the enemy just wants us to mobilize our troops day and night to disrupt the original strategic deployment and create opportunities for the defenders to attack. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said in a low mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to five years ago, the combat effectiveness of the cavalry of the Orc Empire has been severely weakened, and the number of elites is less than one-third of that at its peak, far worse than that of infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former orc empire with millions of armors and 300,000 cavalry that overwhelmed the three kingdoms of the Northern Continent is already a thing of the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most elite cavalry regiments in the empire were all taken to the rear by Duke Daniel, and they are still on their way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are still a few cavalry regiments on the front line, they are scattered all over the place, and only two can rush to the battlefield immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how confident a general is, he can't guarantee that two cavalry legions can stop the expeditionary legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lack of troops was not because the orcs couldn't mobilize more troops to join the battle, but because logistics limited their deployment of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cavalry consumes much more than the infantry. Forcibly mobilizing 300,000 cavalry, not to mention the uneven level of combat effectiveness, the logistics alone can crush the current Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce logistical pressure, they have captured many human fortresses in recent days, but they have gained very little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main source of food harvested on the battlefield is actually the corpses of their own people. The biggest benefit brought by the siege turned out to be the reduction in the number of troops, which eased the logistical pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to this point. For the Orc Empire, intercepting the expeditionary army is actually secondary. How to solve the logistics problem is the key.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since the enemy likes to use intrigues, then use the tricks. Deliberately make a gesture of deploying troops to disrupt the deployment, and lure the main force of the enemy to come out for a decisive battle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of tribes in the rear were destroyed, and there was a huge gap in the strategic materials to be raised in the plan. In a short period of time, it is difficult for us to fill the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by the insufficient supply of strategic materials, we can only passively reduce the frontline troops. The longer the delay, the fewer troops the empire can use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you fight with the enemy and lose both sides, it is better than being exhausted all the time like now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two-lose style of play naturally does not require the five royal families and the Alpha Kingdom to fight for both losses, but to use the troops of the vassal races to consume each other with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of winning or losing, it can solve the current strategic passivity of the Orc Empire. As long as the core of the five royal families is not damaged, it is acceptable to wipe out the vassal races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's try it! Anyway, if the enemy doesn't send troops, we will be forced to evacuate after another month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that Daniel has organized hundreds of thousands of troops, even if the front line suffers heavy losses, he can immediately replenish them. The worst result is nothing more than losing the land now occupied! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagle Emperor agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an Air Force unit, the last thing you fear is Armageddon. When it comes to paddling ability, no one can match them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's air force is limited. As long as they are more stable, the loss of the Hawk people will be within a controllable range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is so exhausting now, and the loss of constantly sending people deep into the sky over the enemy camp to investigate is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past days, the daily losses of Eagle soldiers never fell below double digits, and occasionally reached triple digits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems inconspicuous, but it cannot stand the accumulation of time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the results of the battle, it was directly ignored by the Eagle Emperor. The losses are all their own, but the information that comes out of the investigation is everyone's.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the emperors looked at each other, they quickly unified their positions. Immediately afterwards, a series of military orders were continuously transmitted from the imperial tent to the orc army on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Central Continent, with the triumphant advance of the alien coalition forces, the three major human kingdoms were forced to come to the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse was the first one to choose to do badly. Just two days ago, the army of elves and the Stone People completed a strategic meeting in the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest point of contention between the two sides has now become an established fact. The tragic Hesse Kingdom was directly divided into two by the alien coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is no good news at all. At least they completed the strategic contraction and withdrew the main force from the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't kept the kingdom's more than 200,000 elites, they wouldn't even have the qualifications to be on the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a comprehensive passive strategy, which completely lost the temper of the high-level leaders of the Hesse Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation collapsed too quickly, and before the allies had time to rush over, they were on the verge of subjugation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe if we continue to persevere, the human race can still win, but there is a high probability that the Kingdom of Hesse will not be able to wait for that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shadow of failure hangs over the whole country, and the entire Hesse Kingdom doesn't want to fight from top to bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Bank is not much better. The frontline continues to collapse. Even if they try their best, they cannot stop the advance of the alien coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three-eyed tribe and the troll tribe have not yet joined forces with the elf army, but they have completed a strategic alliance with the dwarf kingdom. No one thought that the dwarf kingdom, which was mired in the quagmire of war, would be able to mobilize troops to fight out from behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knife behind the back is the most terrifying. Before the countries along the way could react, the three major alien races joined together and began to communicate with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resources of the three-eyed tribe and the troll tribe were continuously sent to the dwarf kingdom in exchange for a large amount of advanced ordnance, and they were about to overwhelm the human army in terms of weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has developed to this point, and the countries in the mainland have been unable to stop the strategic alliance of the six alien races. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, the alien alliance will be connected together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cooperation at the juncture of life and death, the military industry of the dwarf kingdom + the resources of various tribes + the magic of the elves, no one knows how powerful this combination can explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with this explosive news, no one cares about the slight advantage Alpha Kingdom gained in the war with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What everyone is most worried about now is that after the six alien races join forces, they will destroy the Alpha Kingdom with a backhand and form a giant that monopolizes the Northern and Central Continents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the development of the situation, the Terran Alliance hastily held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, but the long-term thirst cannot be quenched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, the Holy See, the King of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia have rarely unified their positions. However, it takes time to form a coalition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous support, the three companies must do their best to make a comeback in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries under the three major forces are also required to fully mobilize, but this also takes time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers and horses have not moved, but the food and grass go first. When it comes to the mobilization of millions of troops, how can it be said that troops can be dispatched?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal schedule of preparations, it will not be possible to get it done within a year or so. Involving multi-party alliances will only take longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most efficient Alpha Kingdom had to hoard strategic materials before mobilization, so that it could gather an army within two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being forced by this situation, the three kingdoms of China had no choice but to negotiate in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where the war continues, they don't know whether the human race can win the final victory. Anyway, the countries in the middle mainland have to be destroyed first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the human race wins and supports their restoration of the country, it is still a puppet regime and cannot escape the fate of being annexed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is more likely that they will have an accident, and then recover the lost ground from the aliens, and solve the legal problem once and for all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the era of great mergers has come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, the Holy See, the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia will establish absolute advantages within the human race, and the remaining countries are no longer able to check and balance them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the balance is broken and cannot keep up with the rules of the times, it is inevitable to reshuffle the cards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien army cleared up the local unstable factors first, and when they merged later, even the obstacles to rule would not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have wine today, you will be drunk today, and you will worry about it tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three kingdoms, having seen the changes in the situation, have chosen to negotiate to end the war. As for the issue of Terran's strategic passivity, that is a question for the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only those who have lived into the future are qualified to discuss the future. If you want to entangle the future fate of the human race, you have to survive first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar setbacks have never happened before in human history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the foreign race alliance can be closely united is also forced out by the human race. Once the situation improves, the situation will inevitably change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to instigate internal fighting in the alien alliance, everyone is professional. As long as the experience of their respective infighting is exported, it is only a matter of time before the alien alliance will split.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no internal problems, the alien alliance that has the upper hand will not rush to negotiate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have concerns, creating a favorable basis for peace talks. However, as soon as the negotiations started, the negotiations reached an impasse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Impossible. According to your request, our entire country will be relocated. The relocation of tens of millions of people is simply an impossible task!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dante Kingdom represented Earl Bruno to take the lead in objecting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the boundary line given by the alien alliance, almost the entire Dante Kingdom will have to move, which is completely killing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Bruno is right, this armistice treaty is too harsh. If you want to force us to relocate, then see you on the battlefield!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can die on the battlefield, but we can't die in such a humiliating way on the migration road!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think about it. My human race has not been defeated yet, and you have only temporarily gained an advantage. Countries in the Southern Continent are forming coalition forces. As long as we hold on, the offensive and defensive momentum will be reversed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representative of the South Shore Kingdom, Marquis Pierluigi, resolutely agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is nominally a land exchange, but in fact it requires them to relocate. If they agreed to the conditions of the alien alliance, not to mention strategic issues, the relocation work alone would ruin them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't use the Human Race Alliance to scare us, if the Human Race Alliance is so reliable, the situation will never develop to the present stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put your fantasy on them, don't you know that from the beginning, you are abandoned, just like you abandoned the countries of the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are helping them eliminate dissidents. Don't look at the Holy See, the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia clamoring to send troops. In fact, they are probably very happy in their hearts!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not destroyed, how can they annex the Central Continent logically?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, you should learn from the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi. It was also betrayed by an ally, and the situation is much better now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terran strategy, future, these issues have nothing to do with you. Now the three need to consider how to survive the war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris smiled sweetly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She felt so good at the moment that she was finally able to get it back from the human race after she was slumped on Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe Doris is not a qualified diplomat, but her status as a strong person in the sanctuary is enough to smooth out the technical gap. As long as she sits here, the morale of the representatives of the Three Kingdoms will be lowered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we came here with sincerity. If you want a truce, please also show your sincerity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dares to accept this kind of condition that directly kills us. Even if a treaty is signed, it cannot be implemented in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation, we can agree to replace part of the land, but the core territories of the three countries cannot be moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to join the alliance of different races, you don't have to do it on land. It is also a good choice to connect by sea or river.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really get together forcibly, I am afraid your alliance will not be as harmonious as it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once there is internal strife, all the advantages you have gained now will still be lost in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of repeatedly tossing, it is better to come up with a condition that all parties can accept and reach a strategically significant cessation treaty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least after this war, our Three Kingdoms will no longer be a threat to you, and even for our own benefit, we will become the most staunch anti-war faction in the human race!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The premise of all this is: we must have a certain strength and be able to retain the right to speak in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since His Holiness mentioned the Alpha Kingdom, how about referring to their standards? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When referring to the \"anti-war faction\", Marquis Krasner deliberately emphasized his tone. This was discussed in advance by the high-level officials of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no more bargaining chips in the hand, and the most important bargaining chip now is the right to speak of the Three Kingdoms in the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, for a long time to come, the three countries in China will be under the threat of alien alliances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as a continental war breaks out, they will immediately become the biggest victims who are surrounded by alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how deep the hatred is, as long as the alien alliance is not aggressive, they will become passive and peaceful after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the treatment with reference to the Alpha Kingdom, it is completely a temptation. Judging from the battle situation in the Northern Continent, everyone knows that the Alpha Kingdom has not ceased fighting with the alien alliance, at most it has an agreement with the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the result Doris wants. Talking about the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi is essentially to divide the human race and reduce the resistance of the Three Kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, people follow the herd. It is difficult for them to be the first to eat crabs, but they will be the second and third to eat crabs, and the psychological pressure will no longer exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, can not!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance and the Alpha Kingdom are still at war, and there is nothing to refer to. I just suggest you learn about their flexibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The map is placed here. If there is any dispute, we can discuss it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Times are changing. We are enemies now, but it does not mean that we will be enemies in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similarly, your current allies with the major forces in the Southern Continent does not mean that you will also be allies in the future. In terms of internal fighting, there is no race that can compare to your human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris said mockingly.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The disparity between the psychological expectations of the two parties was too great. Even though both sides made concessions, the negotiations still reached a stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules of the Aslant Continent, problems that cannot be resolved on the negotiating table are usually resolved by fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alien Alliance hopes to use force to force the three countries to submit, and the three countries also want to fight through military means to fight for their own rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first contact, which broke up unhappy, pushed the situation in the Central Continent to a climax, and the war became more and more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes in the international situation have not yet affected the Alpha Kingdom. It's not that the high-level officials of the kingdom don't know that the situation in the mainland is deteriorating, but that they are really beyond their reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the military, Hudson naturally received news of the deteriorating situation in the Central Continent. I don't know where the confidence came from, Caesar IV even sent a letter urging him to quickly solve the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is very good, that's just a superficial phenomenon. Hudson doesn't think the kingdom can win if he really wants to lead the army to a decisive battle with the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the benefits continue, it is because he dragged the orcs into the war of attrition. With the advantage of a higher level of civilization, bully the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs came to their senses, reluctantly gave up a large area of ​​land, and directly gave up confronting them, the situation would change immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even temporarily defeating the orcs is useless. Even with the backing of the Human Alliance, the overall national strength of the kingdom is not enough to support Lao Shi's expedition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the enemy's army has moved. According to the intelligence of the investigation, all the nearby orc armies have been mobilized and are rushing towards us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A fighter plane has appeared, as long as we drag it here for a few days, we can let the defenders fight out...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Kane could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"No need, the time for the decisive battle is not yet ripe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the kingdom needs is not just a victory, but a victory without too much loss. Fighting with the orcs will hurt both sides. What can we do to deal with the international situation later?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass on the order, ignore the enemy's troop mobilization, let the troops wait for the opportunity to find the enemy's weak link, and directly break through and return home! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A fighter plane that everyone can see is not a fighter plane.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what the orc's mind is thinking, it is foolish to mobilize the infantry to surround and hunt the cavalry, but there is definitely nothing wrong with ignoring it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary army can go deep into the enemy's rear once, and then it can come a second time. In the vast prairie, even if the orcs were prepared, they would not be able to guard against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the big tribes can bring a little trouble to the expeditionary army, but the mainstream on the orc prairie is still small and medium tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small tribe of thousands of people, even if the main force is at home, it cannot stop the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot solve the security problem in the rear. In the coming war, the Orc Empire will only become more passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp of the orc army, the faces of the five emperors who received the battle report from the front line were gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to perfect the follow-up battle plan, all the high-level orcs, including the five emperors, did not sleep all night last night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, just as the plan to lure the enemy started, the enemy actually slipped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fool!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's just hopelessly stupid!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three infantry regiments and two cavalry regiments were brought together, and they didn't hold the enemy for a day. The situation of the empire was ruined by the gang of trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The violent Xiong Renhuang immediately cursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The failure of the plan to lure the enemy meant that they lost the possibility of defeating the main force of the Alpha Kingdom in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy army huddled in the city and could not come out. There was no other way but to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary army can run to the Orc Empire for a walk, but it doesn't mean that the Orc Army can also go deep into the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Destroying\" is easy to say, but difficult to implement. There are densely packed fortresses along the way. Even if you send troops, you only dare to move around. Going deep is to contribute to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High risk is second, the key is that it is useless to go deep behind enemy lines. In the hundreds of miles of the front line, the enemy has already fortified the walls and cleared the field, and they can't grab anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, Emperor Xiong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to see this kind of thing happen. The officers and soldiers on the front line also tried their best, but the enemy didn't get entangled with them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mostly it was our plan, which was seen through by Hudson again, and we were never given a chance to display it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good to end it like this now, if we really had a decisive battle at this moment, we wouldn't be able to eat the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for Daniel to bring the army to join us, and then wait for the opportunity to fight the enemy, at least it will increase the odds of winning by a few percent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Xiong Renhuang's words just now stimulated him. The speaker may not be intentional, but the listener is intentional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang blamed his subordinates for being useless, in the eyes of Yinyue Wolf Emperor, he was pointing fingers at Sang Huai.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel, as the coach of the army, must bear the primary responsibility for the current bad state of the war. The son's performance is not good, and his face as an old man is also dull.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to fight back forcefully is also brought out by teammates. Daniel's performance was poor, and the other orcs were even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Change the general to command, maybe the 200,000 army gathered together has now been wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedy of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants has proved that the expeditionary army under the command of Hudson has the ability to defeat the strong with the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wolf King, are you kidding me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the front line is short of supplies. If Daniel brings hundreds of thousands of troops to meet up, what kind of support will the logistics provide?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, I am afraid that the enemy will not need to attack, and the logistics of the army alone will be able to drag down the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all look forward and backward and dare not tell the truth, so let me speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are two roads before us. Either attack all the way through and forcibly tear through the enemy's layers of defense; or give up a large area of ​​land and withdraw the troops directly to recuperate! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Emperor Xiong smashed the table in front of him with a slap, and the flying sawdust startled all the orcs. The scene was much more exciting than lifting the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lid was lifted, and all the generals fell into panic, and turned their attention to the five emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now only they are qualified to participate in this kind of scene, and others may get burned if they speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the indifferent Xiong Renhuang, the faces of the four emperors were also very ugly. The essence of being so shameless is that the strength of each ethnic group has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families were all forced to live in the backcountry for a period of time. In the era of severe shortage of supplies, the losses of the cavalry must be greater than that of the infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the young and yellow were not picked up, in order to continue the racial inheritance, the orc royal family, who could not afford so many war beasts, was forced to reduce the number of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be exact, they just reduced the troop number, and the specific disarmament work was done by the Terran coalition for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the lack of supplies, all ethnic groups had to reduce the number of war beasts raised. The Yinyue Wolf Clan and the Lion Clan suffered the most. Not only did they eliminate the old and the weak, they also temporarily suspended the reproduction of the Wolf Warriors and Lion Warriors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These actions directly determine that their military strength will be greatly affected in the following years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Bearman Royal Family, which was relatively less damaged, gradually surpassed the Lionman Family in military strength, and became the most powerful family in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever is strong has more power to speak. The inherent political rules have always restrained the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the army back into the land of the kingdom, Hudson breathed a sigh of relief. Don't look at him in front of the generals, he has always been calm, but the pressure in his heart is not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are doing things behind enemy lines, and any accidents are possible. If you accidentally collide with the enemy's main force, you will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the generals who were welcoming him, Hudson waved calmly and said: \"The soldiers need to rest after returning from the expedition, so let's postpone the celebration banquet!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Distribute the prepared wine and meat to each unit. It is important to ensure that every soldier of the expeditionary force receives adequate nutritional supplements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be a \"celebration banquet\" after every war, not just a game of boasting. There is enough wine and meat, and it is essentially to supplement nutrition for the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Expeditionary Corps slaughtered all directions on the grassland. Although there was no shortage of food supplements, it was the battlefield after all, and the rhythm of life was still disrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the needs of the war, it is normal to have a hungry meal and a full meal. Many times, wanting to drink a sip of hot soup is an extravagant wish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the journey, eating and sleeping in the open, many soldiers lost weight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was anxious to bring the troops back to rest, but also worried that the soldiers would not be able to hold on. If this elite team of the kingdom was abolished due to overuse, he would have no way to explain it to all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When replying, the generals were suspicious. However, Hudson's prestige still made them swallow the words that came to their lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Postponing the celebration banquet is not canceling it, so there is no need to quarrel with the coach over such a trivial matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers have no opinion, and the soldiers below are even less likely to have any opinion. The prepared wine and meat were all distributed, and the celebration banquet was postponed, which meant that there would be another one later, which would be double the happiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that needs a headache is probably the logistics department. However, this is also a small problem. The expeditionary army went deep into the enemy's rear and made trouble for two months, which saved a lot of food and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After they settled down, the losses of the expeditionary legion were also counted. The price of killing the Quartet all the way is: 4,000 officers and soldiers will stay on the prairie forever, and 2,000 officers and soldiers will be forced to retire and return home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disability can be healed, but it is difficult to replenish the consumed vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the needs of the war, many soldiers have received many magical treatments, and their vitality has been exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you continue to stay on the battlefield, you may die at any time. If you return to your hometown to be honored and raised, you can live for a few more years. If it is well maintained, it may be able to catch up with the average life expectancy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not a heartless person, and he cannot ignore life. The situation in the kingdom has not deteriorated to the point where it must be desperate, and there is no need to send these heroes to a dead end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jose, go to the army for me to dissuade these officers and soldiers who are not suitable to stay on the battlefield.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, I'll go over and make an agreement in person. You are responsible for drafting documents, explaining the detailed situation to the country, and asking the various places to properly accommodate these retired officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, you should also collect statistics and sum up the records of the expeditionary force on the prairie and the relevant battles, and report them to the kingdom after polishing and sorting. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said quite sadly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He can lead the expeditionary army to kill all directions, but he can't change the cruel nature of war. In the face of the cold casualties, the joy of victory disappeared without a trace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia Palace, looking at the information collected from various places, Charles III rubbed his forehead with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't pay attention, the situation in Central China is on the verge of collapse. If no remedial measures are taken, the situation on the mainland is likely to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn the Holy See, what are they doing! They can actually divide the dwarf kingdom, so it's hard for them to ruin my human race's hegemony?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent someone to ask that idiot Pius VII, I want to know what is going on in his mind...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chattering and cursing exposed the anger in Charles III's heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What cultivates rationality is an external illusion. If something big happens, those in power will be angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good to be able to vent your anger in time, but if you keep holding it in your heart, sooner or later something will go wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's angry words were ignored by everyone. Anyway, it was the Holy See who was scolding, and everyone didn't have the heart to defend the enemy, not to mention the Holy See was not wronged at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of elves killed all directions, as everyone expected. Under the joint siege of the Holy See and the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the dwarf kingdom still had the strength to stab the countries of the mainland from behind, which was completely beyond everyone's imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Ruthenia has fallen, and internal conflicts have accumulated a lot, so the poor performance is understandable. It would be too much for the powerful Holy See to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little military knowledge knows that the Holy See must be paddling water in the war, trying to use the dwarf kingdom to consume the military strength of the Ruthenian kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you play tricks and tricks. All countries are calculating each other anyway, but because of the Holy See's calculations, the situation in Central China collapsed, which is intolerable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Charles III also cursed. The Frankish Kingdom is also helpless against the big man of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accountability. Even if the Human Race Alliance Parliament can pass it, it is now unable to initiate a liquidation against the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation in Central China has deteriorated, and the subsequent development of the situation is likely to be beyond our control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most ideal state is that the countries in the mainland and the foreign races will fight to the end until the mainland coalition forces arrive to reverse the current passive situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the probability of this happening is not high. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the three major kingdoms in Central China are likely to choose to compromise with the alien alliance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Marquis Jesús analyzed solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To \"compromise\" with the enemy in a completely passive situation is not simply to stop the war, there must be a series of additional conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the three kingdoms in the mainland, the future direction of the mainland war has become confusing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that most of the human power is in the Southern Continent, but this power is not so easy to control. How to deal with the relationship between the three giants of the Holy See, the Frankish Kingdom, and the Iberian Kingdom is a thorny problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, the fallen Kingdom of Oprus, Avalat, and Ruthenia also have their own plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the current situation may not be the worst. In fact, compared to us, the Holy See should have more headaches now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of their own laissez-faire, the blockade against the dwarf kingdom has now collapsed, and the subsequent war will cause them headaches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the nobles of the countries in the middle mainland hate them now. After the war, the influence of the Holy See in the mainland is bound to be hit hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conditions for establishing a separate Holy See are now fully mature. As long as the Continental War is over, we can begin our operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these benefits, the kingdom has further established its advantages over other countries in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, the situation on the mainland is very likely to have a pattern of one superpower and many powers under our leadership.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the alien alliance, there is actually no need to take it too seriously. The current glory is only a flash in the pan, and the current elves are not suitable for war. This continental war is their last bloom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current victory seems to have changed the embarrassing situation of the alien alliance, but it is actually too fragile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fairness is a big issue. The fact that the foreign race alliance can come back against the wind is essentially the contribution of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these contributions cannot be unlimited, and they need to be rewarded sooner or later. When interests are involved, disputes are bound to arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffering and taking advantage are difficult to define in themselves. No matter how the postwar benefits are distributed, there will be racial dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a little provocation, the internal conflicts of the alien alliance will intensify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the alien alliance after the armistice is easier to deal with than it is now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the prime minister, Duke Bergson, made the atmosphere relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the situation has deteriorated severely, but the threat of the congenital alien alliance to the Frankish Kingdom is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elves can help the alien alliance to reverse the situation, but it does not mean that they are willing to continue to contribute to the expansion of each race.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As the person directly responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the mainland, overwhelming pressure from public opinion swept towards the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to throw the pot away. According to the division of tasks within the Terran Alliance, the Dwarf Kingdom happens to be within the responsibility of the Holy See, and they took the initiative to take on this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The active performance of the Holy See is not only to take the opportunity to weaken the Kingdom of Ruthenia, but also to expand the influence of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be very scary if a religious organization had no sense of existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when there are rebels in the northern and southern continents, who are always trying to subvert their sacred status, the Holy See needs to come out to gain a sense of presence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just judging from the current situation, the situation is somewhat counterproductive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through this war, the influence of the Holy See has indeed been expanded, and the declining Kingdom of Ruthenia was infiltrated into a sieve by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that something happened to the dwarf kingdom, and it didn't follow the established script, which ruined the good situation of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for trusting allies too much, failing to guard against the enemies in the rear, and being taken advantage of by the dwarf kingdom, the situation in the Central Continent would not have suddenly deteriorated to the point of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having suffered such a big loss, the countries in the mainland will naturally not let it go. If you can't help the Holy See in action, then fight back in public opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the final result is, the Holy See has to give everyone an explanation for such a big omission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that the new round of the Human Race Alliance Council has directly become a criticism meeting against the Holy See. Representatives from various countries in the mainland caught them and yelled at them, which made the representatives of the Holy See almost depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representatives who are more polite criticize them for \"indulging foreigners to cause harm to others\"; representatives who are not polite directly charge them with the crime of \"colluding with other races and eradicating dissidents\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lord of Dawn, on the deterioration of the situation in the Central Mainland, they are at most suspected of conniving with other races, and they have definitely not reached the point of \"colluding with other races and eliminating dissidents\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter how you look at it, the countries in the middle mainland are not the mortal enemies of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is really colluding with other races and eradicating dissidents, it will also target the two heretics of the Alpha Kingdom and the Frank Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Gulei, I need a reasonable explanation for the dwarf kingdom's invasion of the Central Continent!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII's words made everyone's hearts tremble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hastily called the coach back from the front line, and anyone with a discerning eye knows that this is the rhythm of accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you directly reprimand, or even swear, it means that there is still room for redemption, and the most fearful thing is this kind of lack of expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this incident was completely an accident. The army of the Dwarf Kingdom was dragged to the front line by us, and no one thought that they would form dozens of second-line legions...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gulei hadn't finished his explanation, and Pius VII put a mocking smile on his face, and asked indifferently:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a good thing I didn't think of it, why don't you go to the Human Race Alliance Congress and explain things clearly in front of representatives from various countries?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are dozens of second-line legions, with hundreds of thousands of troops, not dozens or hundreds of dwarves. You, the front-line coach, actually told me that I don't know!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Well, really good!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these troops don't go to the Central Continent, but directly appear on the battlefield of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, don't you have to tell me—no one thought of it beforehand? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization of a large number of troops is difficult to keep completely secret. This kind of thing is not based on thinking, as long as more people are sent to investigate, they will definitely find something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See does not have an air force. No matter how well-prepared the enemy is, it is impossible to block the entire border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just find an opportunity, and you can fly over. If it really doesn't work, sneak in at night with the cover of darkness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dwarf kingdom is at best well-defended on the front line, but there are not so many air force guards in the rear. With a little care, you can find something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the information lags behind, everyone can accept it. However, the reality is that the Holy See knows nothing about the military mobilization in the dwarf kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy really aimed at the Kingdom of Ruthenia, there would be hundreds of thousands more enemy troops at once, and the coalition led by the Holy See would definitely suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the reason is, the charge of dereliction of duty, Gu Lei will definitely not be able to escape this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good that the situation can be restored. If the Central Continent cannot be pulled back from the abyss, the tragedy will not only be Gu Lei himself, but the entire Holy See will be hit hard politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please give us a chance to make amends!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the situation in the Central Continent has deteriorated, the Judgment Knights have launched a fierce attack on the front line, striving to defeat the Dwarf Kingdom in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deterioration of the situation is only temporary. After we can defeat the main force of the Dwarf Kingdom, we will immediately send troops into the Central Continent to support the countries and help...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Gu Lei could finish speaking, the old enemy at the side, Blake, the head of the Judgment Knights, stood up and interrupted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Anyone can say big things, but the key still depends on the performance on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dwarf Kingdom, if it was so easy to defeat, this war would not be dragged on until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make a mistake, you must admit it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you carry on to the end, you will only make more mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, I am afraid that before we defeat the Dwarf Kingdom, the situation in the Central Continent will collapse first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority now is not to quickly defeat the dwarf kingdom, but to stabilize the countries in the middle continent first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare for an alliance of foreign races to cooperate sincerely once. I don't think this situation will last long. Maybe the elves are already trying to negotiate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, their strategic goals for participating in this war have basically been achieved. To continue, that is purely paying for the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the races in the Alien Alliance now rely heavily on the support of the elves. As long as the elves want peace talks, they cannot stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the current situation, if it is not for the concern that the Terran Alliance will be held accountable afterwards, I am afraid that as long as the elves show a little bit of goodwill, the countries in the mainland will rush to compromise with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to be able to stabilize the situation in the Central Mainland. If nothing can be done, then find a way to ease the relationship with the countries in the Central Mainland. Otherwise, the post-war situation will be very unfavorable to us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of analysis made Gulei sweat directly on his forehead. There is no way, the old enemy's troubles have all hit his weakness, and these problems are precisely what he is most worried about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trapped to the brink of national subjugation and genocide, if the countries in the middle mainland escape this catastrophe by chance, they will definitely alienate the Holy See after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his mind, Gu Lei had already vaguely seen a group of new heretics rising. It echoes the two heresies of the north and the south, and is full of heresies from south to north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"you…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble he caused was too great, he gritted his teeth in hatred, and Gu Lei was forced to swallow the words when he got to his lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to win sympathy points, you must show weakness now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many factors that affect accountability, right and wrong are only secondary factors, and the pope must also consider political balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Knights of Judgment caused trouble a few days ago, and Blake was able to land smoothly. The most important thing is that the Pope wants to play balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is similar. The several major knight orders of the Holy See confront each other and check and balance, so that the authority of the Pope can be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the style of Pius VII, before a more suitable replacement is found, the probability of directly beating someone to death with a stick is very small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the current Ruthenian battlefield is still dominated by the Judgment Knights. After taking down Gulei, the commander of the army, and suddenly replacing him, the issue of command alone is not smooth for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoever caused the mess will be responsible for cleaning it up. Commander of the Gulei Army, I don't care what difficulties you have, the Kingdom of Ruthenia must achieve a breakthrough in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it, then you don't have to come back. The Holy See does not raise waste, especially waste that only causes trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Sauron, arrange for people from the countries in the Central Mainland to contact you. If they are willing to persevere, we can give you some compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the situation changes, the relationship between us and the countries in the Middle Mainland must now be repaired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Try to make the Three Kingdoms persist as much as possible. It is really impossible, so don't force it. You can make promises to them when necessary. In short, everything is based on repairing the relationship. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to settle accounts after autumn. Even if there is a replacement, it will be after Gu Lei cleans up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reactions of the crowd, you can tell that there are many people who are angry with Gu Lei, but none of them asked for a coaching change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't want to replace him, but the main reason is that the position of the frontline commander is too hot now. Whoever goes up is going to clean up the mess, it should be done well, and we have to take responsibility together if we mess up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to turn things around in a short period of time, severely damage the dwarf kingdom, and send troops into the Middle Continent is purely drawing a big picture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the Holy See army is strong, and the dwarves are not soft persimmons. In particular, the occupied area of ​​the Dwarf Kingdom is still dominated by mountains and hills, which is not suitable for large armies to expand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it is not suitable for the deployment of large human armies, and the dwarf army can still move freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Arms Kingdom is also a mining madman. Most of the traffic in the Dwarf Kingdom is a super tunnel connected by mines. It is equipped with an exclusive magic mining vehicle with a load capacity of several tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transport ore in peacetime, transport troops and strategic materials in wartime, it is a proper national heavy weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to guard against the human race, the Dwarf Kingdom deliberately designed the height of the mines in the border area to be particularly short. With a height of less than 1.3 meters, humans simply cannot walk normally in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of national defense projects, the investment of the dwarf kingdom is also not low. There are a lot of various fortresses and fortresses, and they are basically built beyond the specifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention weapons and equipment, the most powerful arms dealer in the mainland will not lack equipment for anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reduced configuration version sold externally is a symbol of quality and is deeply loved by all ethnic groups in the mainland. The power of the original authentic product will only be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the war before the Holy See, it was too late to make a breakthrough, and the lack of effort was only one reason, and the dwarves were really not easy to bully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Continent, since the expeditionary force entered the repair period, Hudson once again lived a life of staring at the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A decisive battle is impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how lured by the orc army outside, he insisted on standing still. The generals who were eager to try were also scolded **** by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson has already achieved fame and established a prestige in the army, otherwise he would have been suspected of playing badly if he played like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more unpretentious the tactics, the harder it is to crack. A simple move of braking with static force caused the orc army a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach Daniel also returned with his troops, but after a stroll on the prairie, his status as a military **** no longer exists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is afraid of comparison in everything, and meeting Hudson can only be regarded as his unlucky luck. The loss of soldiers and generals buried most of his prestige in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that he is too young, he has only been a coach for a short time, and his prestige has not yet been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a veteran star, encountering such a small setback is nothing at all. After all, a flower does not have a hundred days to be successful, and a person does not have a thousand days to be happy, and no one can guarantee constant victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Daniel, don't put too much psychological pressure on you. After the battle that happened on the prairie, we all know that the main responsibility is not on you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, no one would have expected that following the march would lead to deviations of dozens of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers involved in the incident were all killed, and there is no way to pursue accountability, so let the matter pass!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adjust your mentality first, you need to worry about the next war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon Emperor Alex spoke comfortingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the five emperors, he is the only one who can do this kind of soothing job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with personal ability, it is mainly because the other four emperors are full of arrogance and cannot put down their airs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything comes from strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, the Bimon royal family has declined too much, and has fallen behind among the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the just-concluded prairie war, they lost another large tribe. Let the population that is not wealthy be hit hard again, and if some changes are not made, the family will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Therefore, Alex had to find a suitable role in the empire in order to keep Beamon's royal status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Your Majesty Beamon, for your concern. My current state has stabilized and will not affect the follow-up battle.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel responded politely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gratitude still inadvertently flowed between the brows. Obviously, this cold-faced duke also has a tender side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he knew Alex was putting on a show, he was very grateful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much the emperor is defeated, he is also the leader of the orc empire. Alex can help to say a fair word, which is more effective than Daniel's own defense a hundred times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is here, let's start discussing the issue of troop withdrawal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and the plan to quickly defeat the Alpha Kingdom can already be declared bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The empire could not bear the loss of forced siege, and the enemy refused to come out for a decisive battle. If the army continues to stay here, apart from wasting money, food and time, there will be no real gains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meaningless confrontation, I personally think it is unnecessary to continue. It is expected that the national strength will be wasted here, so it is better to go back and recuperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, the consumption of the empire has been very high, and all ethnic groups are in a state of exhaustion. It is time to take a good rest. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor spoke first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wolves travel thousands of miles to eat meat. The supply of strategic materials is insufficient, and these carnivorous races have become the biggest victims.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wolf King is right, it is indeed time to take a break. The empire has just recovered the prairie, and production in various places needs to resume.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to rely solely on the old, weak, sick and disabled in the rear. What we should do is to stop the war as soon as possible, disband the peasants and the army and go back to reclaim the land and graze. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The once-battle faction has become the current peace faction. Politics is so mysterious. In the face of racial interests, flexible political positions are also necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stopping the war is not something we can count on if we say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Does the Alpha Kingdom on the opposite side agree?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How should the Alien Alliance explain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our relationship with the alliance is not good. If we continue to make peace with the enemy without authorization, our relationship with the various races in the alliance will be over! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang immediately objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He does not object to stopping the war, but not now. The situation in the Central Continent has finally benefited the alien alliance. If you withdraw from the war at this time, you are selling your teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar operations have been done by the Orc Empire in history. They were isolated and helpless in the last war, which was the price they paid for \"betrayal\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategic materials are scarce, so find a way to solve it. If the food supply is insufficient, we can replace it with wild vegetables, leaves, bark and grass roots. Who was not a carnivore in ancient times?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the Xiongrenhuang, the insistence of these pure carnivorous races is hypocrisy. As long as you are hungry for a few more days, it will naturally change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the bear people can become omnivores, so other races should have no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Xiong, you said it yourself, we don't have a good relationship with the major forces in the alliance, so why bother to catch up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we gritted our teeth and persisted until the end, they would not appreciate it, but would think it should be so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alien Alliance wants to explain, why?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the support from the elves, we have never received any assistance from other races, why should we look at their faces. If you want to exclude us, let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's control area is not bordering, even if we are excluded in the alien alliance, it will not affect us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor immediately retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Orc Empire doesn't want to form a group with the alien alliance. It's mainly because the Alpha Kingdom, the “nail house” in the middle, can't pull out this nail, and can't hold a group if they want to.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the history of the Alpha Kingdom, there is no precedent for the orcs to propose a truce to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All previous orc invasions ended the war after the Human Race Alliance intervened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You heard me right, the orcs did send a mission to negotiate a truce with the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving the guard's affirmative answer, Hudson once wanted to kill the orc envoy and sacrifice the flag. Anyway, it must be politically correct to kill orcs in the Alpha Kingdom, and you can deal with it with any excuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The orcs used the name of negotiation to allow assassins to sneak into the delegation as ministers to take the opportunity to assassinate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this kind of nonsensical matter is reported to the kingdom, everyone will only call the orcs mean and shameless, and no one will verify the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In everyone's subconscious mind, it has long been recognized that such unscrupulous things can be done by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reversal does not exist. Anyone in the kingdom who dares to defend the orcs will immediately be notorious. This is the power of hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Hudson fell into deep thought. Judging from the current situation on the battlefield, the Orc Empire really has no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has been spending here, not to mention wasting money and food, and missed the time to store supplies for the winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if the war ceased immediately and they went back to make preparations, this winter would still be a nightmare for countless orc tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wounds from the last war have not been healed, and a new war hastily launched. The Orc Empire itself is making a foolish move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson were to be in charge of the Orc Empire, he would recuperate as soon as possible after destroying the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Alien Alliance, just make some noise in the border area and stage a confrontation with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that his own strength is not enough, he still ran out to play Continental Hegemony, which is purely brainwashed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a rational analysis, it is not impossible for the orc executives to make timely corrections and choose to stop the war when they realize that they have made mistakes in their strategic decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is only in theory. In fact, when making decisions, those in power still need to consider many factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the best is not necessarily the most suitable. An alliance country composed of multiple races, the internal situation of the orc empire itself is a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interests of the empire often run counter to the interests of the race. Those in power of the five royal families will definitely give priority to the interests of their own race, followed by the interests of the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, immediately send someone to send the news back to the country, and let the high-level officials of the kingdom decide whether to negotiate with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the orc missions, let them go back to their camp and wait for the news. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson still chose to transfer the trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Orc\" itself means trouble, not to mention setting aside the human race alliance and privately launching armistice negotiations with the orcs, which involves such a wide-ranging event, it is best not to get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is only the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's army, not a powerful minister with power over the government, so he doesn't need to worry so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Caesar IV has been in a panic recently, so he threw this trouble over and let him deal with it. His majesty the king in the province is always pointing fingers at the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alpha Kingdom that needs time to recuperate, it is naturally the best choice to be able to defeat the enemy without fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem now is that although the orcs proposed the truce, the orc empire has not yet been defeated, and even occupies the seven northern provinces of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an easy task to get back from the negotiating table what was not obtained on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, just recovering the lost land may not be able to satisfy the appetites of all parties in the kingdom. Do you want to kill the orcs to make up for the losses in the war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar IV, who received the news, had no idea that he had picked up a hot potato, and was still rejoicing because the orcs asked for a truce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to force an old enemy to bow his head is a very honorable thing. If this matter is done well, it will definitely leave a strong mark in the history books.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one day he can go to the kingdom of God and meet the ancestors of the kingdom, he will have the capital to brag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the time of the continental war, the negotiation with the orcs had to be done in private, and Caesar IV would have to go out and pretend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, is the news confirmed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orcs really want a truce? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado asked hurriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hate to hate, can end the war decently, no one wants to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Striking against the Orc Empire is itself a **** business. Even if the war is won, at most it will occupy a piece of grassland, and there will be a lawsuit after the war on the ownership of property rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current international situation, the Alpha Kingdom might be forced to hand it over just after eating it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, there is no legal support, and the difficulty of expansion is completely **** level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is barely eaten, the huge war expenses will crush the kingdom's finances; the heavy casualties will even suffocate the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The news came from Marshal Hudson. The orcs sent a negotiating mission to enter the kingdom, but he persuaded them to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the analysis of the current situation, the enemy should really not want to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the expeditionary force just made a big fuss in the Orc Empire, and their logistics should have serious problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing to spend with the kingdom on the battlefield, apart from wasting money and food in vain, they can't get any cheap! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no objection to this explanation. When it comes to their understanding of the orc empire, everyone present knows no less than the top orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every year, the kingdom spends a lot of money to infiltrate and collect intelligence on the orc empire. It is said that within the orc empire, there are also partners of the kingdom, and there may even be more than one family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the case with multi-ethnic tribal alliance countries full of contradictions. As long as you are willing to spend your money, you will not worry about finding a partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific race and tribe are highly confidential. Except for the person in charge of the joint, only the king knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the in-depth understanding of the orc empire is limited to a few high-level kingdoms. Including the big nobles in many places, the information they got was cut down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not deliberately concealing it, mainly because the Orc Empire back then was much stronger than the Alpha Kingdom. Every time I see the data, everyone feels the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This heavy pressure can only be endured by a few people in the upper echelons. If the whole world knows about it, the hearts of the people below will be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It lasted until after the last war, when the Orc Empire became decadent, and the information that had been tightly sealed was gradually released to all the high-level officials of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what the Orc Watchers are doing now should be to bypass the two major alliances and negotiate a truce with us alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were traitors once, and they were not welcomed by all races in the alien alliance. It would be no big deal to betray them again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we are different, the Kingdom has always been the backbone of the Human Alliance. The Alliance has provided us with assistance in every orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you bypass the Human Race Alliance and stop the war with the Orc Empire alone, I am afraid it will be unreasonable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, with the current battlefield situation, if we want to get what we want on the negotiating table, the orcs probably won't agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to wait and see the development of the situation first, and it will not be too late to contact the orcs after the front line has made a breakthrough. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero immediately objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that northern Xinjiang has been fighting for half a year, in fact, the kingdom's mobilization sequence has not yet been completed, and there are still troops from many provinces that have not yet had time to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ending the war in such a hasty way is too disrespectful of everyone's efforts. Especially those aspiring young people who have invested their capital and want to make contributions, are afraid that they will cry to death at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, we have to wait for the noble private armies in each province to take turns on the battlefield and give everyone a chance to make contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the noble children in the kingdom were not as belligerent as they are now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Orc Empire is really not easy to mess with, and if you are not careful, you will lose your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just different now. Everyone knows that fighting under the command of Marshal Hudson is not only easy to make military exploits, but also has a high safety factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct evidence is: after Hudson took office, the number of people reporting funerals has decreased a lot. The troops recruited in the early stage were replenished once, which was caused by the predecessor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the data from previous orc invasions, what month was there on the front line, and tens of thousands of people died in battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Flesh and Flesh Mill was turned on, it was not impossible for hundreds of thousands of people to die a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the current average monthly death rate of less than 3,000, the intensity of the war is no longer at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Self-casualties are small, and there are not many enemies hacked to death. It's all because the government's propaganda is unreliable, and the ordinary orcs killed by the expeditionary army are also counted in the record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle damage data of the two sides rushed to one to several hundred at once. With the stimulation of these gorgeous data, any aristocratic children who are a little bit ambitious can't help it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the arrogance of the war faction in the kingdom was soaring, as if it could destroy the orc empire at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even King Caesar IV was affected by the general environment. He couldn't help but make suggestions a few days ago, but the suggestion he gave was regarded as a wrong answer by Hudson, and he made a round of elimination first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being rejected tragically, Caesar IV was brought back to reality, no longer fantasizing about destroying the Orc Empire all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the moment, it is leaning towards the peace faction, mainly due to political needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, a disobedient marshal, has already made outstanding achievements in battle. If the war continues, Hudson's influence in the army will further expand, which is not conducive to the balance of power within the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally planned checks and balances within the military, along with Hudson's rising prestige, are now completely bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, Caesar IV also has a bottom line. In his opinion, deliberately making troubles and dragging his teammates down is completely the work of a foolish king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV, who regarded himself as a wise king, naturally would not do it. For a while, I couldn't think of a better solution, so I could only stare blankly at the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This situation continued until the news that the orcs demanded negotiations came, which made him see a different path, using political and diplomatic means to end the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sooner the war ends, the kingdom can resume normal operations as soon as possible, and the power occupied by the military can slowly return to the king's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the delay is too long, the kingdom's army wins the final victory on the battlefield, and Hudson, who is in full swing, returns triumphantly, and the prime minister will have to make room for him, and it will be difficult to regain power from the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving a glance, the understanding foreign minister immediately stood up and said: \"Your Excellency, the account is not calculated that way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the three countries in China have already started negotiations with the Alien Alliance secretly, and the two sides have met at least three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe when, a secret contract was signed between them. With a few of them leading the way, our small actions are not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the negotiations are successful, it is estimated that all countries in the mainland will follow suit. Even if the Terran Alliance wanted to punish the crime, there were so many forces involved, and there was no way to investigate it in depth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we do it a little bit more covertly and don't leave any obvious evidence, even if things are leaked in the future, we can deny them to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voices of the domestic war faction are easier to handle. As long as they clarify the pros and cons to the governors of the provinces, they will naturally appease the good people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we really need to worry about is whether we can get what we want during the negotiation process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering legal issues, I think that before the failure of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland to restore the country cannot be determined, there is no need for the kingdom to rush to expand its territory for the time being, as long as it can successfully recover the lost land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peace talks were first proposed by the orcs themselves. We think that the high-level orcs should be able to agree to our basic requirements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it's for diplomacy. The little tricks between the three countries in China and the alien alliance can't be hidden from professionals at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, some inadvertent small habits fall into the eyes of caring people, which is the biggest flaw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the main fighters continued to speak, Caesar IV said first: \"Send someone to meet with the orc representatives in private first. It's best if you can negotiate, and continue to fight if you can't agree!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The right to speak in the military is almost deprived, but the right to speak in politics and diplomacy is still in the hands of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just sending people to contact the orcs, and not signing a treaty, it should be considered as a face for the king, and simply no longer object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In mainland China, after several in-depth meetings and communications between the high-level officials of the two sides, the two sides sat on the negotiating table again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference from the past is: the faces of the representatives of the three countries in mainland China all look bad. It is obvious that they have been severely beaten by society in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No way, my own army is not performing well on the battlefield, and the diplomats are not tough when they go outside\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, we meet again. I hope everyone can get their wish this time and reach an armistice agreement smoothly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 466": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 466: Chosen Peace Faction\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    It is also a bargain. Compared with the last negotiation, the attitude of the representatives of the three countries in China is much lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the relocation of the whole country, which is really impossible to achieve, the remaining issues have become negotiable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we have all made so many concessions, you should also give in a little bit, so that we can have an explanation when we go back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Krasner said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was really no other way. After seven days of delay, the Kingdom of Hesse lost another province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of troops on the front line exceeded 150,000, including three standing corps, which were also disabled, and the casualties of the poor cannot be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge loss made the main combat faction of the Kingdom of Hesse collectively lose their voices. There is really no way, the enemy's advance speed is getting faster and faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are responsible for providing long-range firepower, and the alien alliance is responsible for sending troops to attack the city. This combination is really abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are younger brothers as cannon fodder, and the family members don't have to go out to charge the battle. The elves who have no scruples are not afraid of war anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This change frightened the three countries in the mainland and hurriedly accelerated the negotiation process. Lest the elves change their original plan and destroy them directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, what Marquis Krasner said is correct, you see, otherwise, we will turn these disputed areas into buffer zones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, everyone does not garrison troops, but secretly we send people to manage them together. The buffer zone is completely free and open, and everyone can trade freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, your alien alliance is also connected together through the buffer zone, and we can also give an explanation to the ethnic alliance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Bruno bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dividing a buffer zone from one's own land and handing it over to both parties for joint management is a proper loss of power and humiliation of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the alliance of different races is now almost an established fact. There is nothing that can be blocked on the battlefield, and there is a high probability that there will be no play on the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom of Hesse was beaten by the enemy, and the kingdom of Dante was ravaged by the coalition of foreign races like the kingdom of the South Bank. Every time the negotiations dragged on for a day, tens of thousands of people would pay the price of their lives for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there are a lot of content about losing power and humiliating the country. The three countries not only have to pay a large amount of war reparations, but also cede large tracts of territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deadly carry the areas that are not allowed, that is because these areas are strategically important areas, once they are given away, it is not the aliens who are divided and surrounded, but the three unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Three Kingdoms can bear the pain of cutting their flesh, the Terran Alliance cannot tolerate being separated from the North and the South, and has since fallen into a strategic passivity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be selling miserably, but it is actually a showdown. Once the bottom line of the human race is touched, then this war can only be endless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the alien alliance seems to be very good, but the family members know their own affairs, and what is false is ultimately false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human coalition forces are gathering. Once this new force joins the war, the good situation of the alien alliance will soon be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the fall of the half-orc kingdom, the balance of power between the human race and the alien race alliance has been broken. The destruction of the ogre has widened the gap in strength between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alien Alliance was not idle and destroyed the Warhammer Kingdom and many small countries in the Northern Continent, the Ancient Remnant Alliance was also abolished by the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the performance on the battlefield, only the elves in the foreign race alliance can enter the first echelon of the mainland in terms of comprehensive strength. The performance of the dwarf kingdom is also good, but it is only close to the first echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the orcs is also good, but there is still the nail house of the Alpha Kingdom in the Northern Continent, so they can't be counted on at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stone people, the three-eyed tribe, and the troll tribe are all fighting the alliance. Before the arrival of the elf army, they were suppressed and beaten by the three kingdoms of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race were to fight in an all-out decisive battle, it is estimated that the three major alien races would be offset by the countries in the mainland. The human forces in the Southern Continent still need the elves and dwarves to deal with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is also an alliance of ancient survivors in the foreign race alliance, but that is just an addition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to calculate the power in the dark, but judging from the power on the surface: the combination of elves + dwarves is likely to be slightly inferior to the Holy See + Frankish Kingdom + Iberian Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they were able to hurry up and destroy the countries in the Central Continent before the arrival of the allied forces of the human race, what about the three fallen human kingdoms in the Southern Continent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how wasteful the human kingdom is, it is also in the third echelon. It is still better than the stone people, three-eyed people, and trolls who suffered heavy losses after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are theoretical data. If there is a real fight, it still depends on their respective performances on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most typical example is the three countries in the mainland. Kong has a strong national strength, and ten percent of the strength can only be used to five or six points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Look at what you are saying, it seems that people are not humane.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if you don't want to change the land, why make it so embarrassing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, I also made a concession on behalf of the alliance, and these disputed areas will be dealt with in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Good people do it to the end, and I will give you a big favor, and I don't want the land ceded by the three kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it has helped you Three Kingdoms so much, so you should show it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dai Lisi's half-smile made the expressions of the three of them change drastically. They dare not eat pies that fall from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an enemy, everyone is doing everything possible to find opportunities to weaken the opponent's strength. How could anyone take the initiative to return the meat that was delivered to his mouth?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, don't scare us. We have already discussed the matter of cutting the land, so there is really no need to make extra troubles!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Pierre Luigi said in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, the Kingdom of the South Bank was going to cede two provinces to the alien alliance. Now the enemy suddenly said no.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Pierre Luigi was very worried, and Doris' next condition was: let them betray the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to hook up with a foreign race secretly, but it can be fatal if you put it on the surface. The human race never relents when dealing with traitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the major forces in the Southern Continent have their own minds and are slow to form a coalition army, once it is reported that a country has betrayed the human race, the conscript army will immediately kill it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is inconvenient on land, they will come from the sea. As long as the major forces are willing to spend their money, they can be cleaned up in less than a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for the Human Race Alliance to send troops, the nobles below will draw a clear line with them first and fight against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Doris' face changed slightly, and the aura that belonged exclusively to the sanctuary suddenly exuded, making the three of them break out in cold sweat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's up to you guys. If you don't agree, you three countries will lose the value of existence. Do you really think that we don't have the strength to destroy you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that things have come to this, I am not afraid to tell you the truth. Letting you guys off, that's because we hope to see the peace faction appear in the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How bad your location is, I don't need to say more!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If another continental war breaks out, your three countries will definitely be the first to be eliminated. For your own strategic security, you also need a stable international environment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of overall strategy, our position is now the same. For the common good, we all work together for world peace. Is there any problem? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden showdown left the representatives of the Three Kingdoms dumbfounded. Regarding the issue of future strategic choices, everyone is not a fool, and they have long been caressing in their hearts, but there are some things that can be done, so they can't be said!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put it carelessly on the bright side, which does not conform to the current political game rules at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, the three nodded in tacit agreement. Working hard for world peace is also a good political slogan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can sit at the negotiating table. Apart from the fact that the Three Kingdoms have no choice, there is another important reason: the elves are the most determined peacemakers in the entire continent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is no war, the strength of the elves can grow slowly. With their longevity far exceeding that of other ethnic groups, they need the peace of the mainland most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we are all peace-loving. Even if you don't say it, our three countries will firmly oppose war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things are not considered conditions at all. Otherwise, there is no need to write it in the treaty. We are originally a member of the Lord and the camp. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Pierre Luigi resisted the pressure and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treaties are brought and torn up, but contracts are not. Among the various races in the mainland, the ancient elves have gone the furthest in the field of magic, and many mysterious contracts were created by elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at what Doris did, it was clear that they were asked to sign a strongly binding peace contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once such a choice is reached, the Three Kingdoms will have no room for political maneuvering, and those in power must act as peacemakers if they do not want to be backlashed by the power of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current three countries, a peaceful international environment is really needed to carry out internal political reforms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is only for now. Once the internal political reform is completed and the national power becomes stronger again, this contract will become a bondage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the three of them understood: why the elf army can go south with confidence. The feeling is that the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi secretly signed a magic contract with the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the mandatory constraints of the contract, it is natural that the two countries will not be afraid of a sudden turn of events.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is how strong the constraints of the power of the contract are. It would be fine if it only affects the signatories themselves, but at worst, it will take a hundred or eighty years until all those in power of this generation sit down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am afraid that the binding force of the contract can always play a role, directly binding the rise and fall of a power, forcing everyone to work hard for \"mainland peace\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not considered a condition, what are you worried about, just sign the contract directly, isn't it hello, me, hello, everyone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contract template is here. If you want to end this war, not only you have to sign the contract, but all the great nobles and power holders in your country must sign on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, we purposely added blank pages to the contract, and writing hundreds of names would not be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to those in power, the eighth-level and above powerhouses in your three kingdoms must also sign on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can take a look at the specific content of the contract first. They are all working hard for the peace of the mainland, and there are absolutely no additional conditions added. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dai Lisi's words made the representatives of the Three Kingdoms lose their temper completely. Once the contract is signed, the next three countries have no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person in power can be replaced, but the strong in the kingdom cannot. A powerhouse above the eighth rank is the core heritage of a large power, and it is a part that cannot be discarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in their hearts, the three of them couldn't help thinking about it. In addition to the constraints of political positions, this contract is generally quite generous to the three countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally ceded land is now also removed. Only the small countries in the Central and Northern Continents really made the sacrifices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, these allies are now in ruins, and the possibility of restoring the country is almost zero. It is not a big problem to let them sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no land cession, no large-scale genocide, and no history of humiliation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These potential hidden mines have been ruled out, and there will be no endless hatred between the two sides. After the war, the power that supported the Three Kingdoms' desire for revenge was also stifled in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having gained insight into the calculations of the elves, the three of them gradually came out of their panic. Obviously, these measures of the elves are sincerely working for the peace of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, these terms are beyond the scope of the previous negotiations. We must report to the kingdom before we can make a decision. Please give us a little more time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Pierre Luigi replied nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the content of the contract, if you are forced to sign a contract, you will not have a good experience. Weak countries have no diplomacy, which is vividly reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they met the elves who were \"forced to love peace\", otherwise the matter would definitely not be so easy to solve. If the protagonist is replaced by an orc, I'm afraid I won't be able to compromise even if I want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whatever, the war will not stop anyway. As long as you three countries can hold it back, I don't care!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris waved her hand and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the normal opening rhythm, unlike when she was in the Northern Continent before, she was deflated when she first appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are in good spirits on happy occasions. The army advanced smoothly on the battlefield, and the game at the negotiating table also developed according to the established plan. Doris became more relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the northern battlefield, Hudson was not surprised at all when he received the news that the Kingdom had also started negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his position as Caesar IV, the war must be ended as soon as possible, and the fruits of victory will be transformed into real strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether they can get anything from the orc empire, it is actually not important to the royal family at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The east side is not lit, but the west side is also lit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous insider transaction is about to be realized. Compared with the dangerous orc prairie, it is obviously the land of the Warhammer Kingdom in the west, which is more comfortable and comfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of getting entangled with the orcs, it is better to support the Principality of Mosi to annex the Great Plains of Warhammer, and add a generous dowry to the queen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the basis of all this is that the queen is pregnant. This unborn offspring, if male, would be joint heirs to the kingdom and this dowry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's a girl, then go ahead and give birth. Anyway, being able to conceive smoothly proves that both parties have no physical problems and have the ability to continue giving birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Reply to the capital, and say that I respect the decision of the kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The long-lost peace ushered in the northern continent filled with gunpowder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How about it, has Marshal Hudson agreed to send troops?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is never a shortage of smart people in the world. With the hatred between the Alpha Kingdom and the orcs, a truce during the continental war is itself an incredible thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sensing something was wrong, the Northern Noble Group took immediate action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, not only our request for battle was rejected, but also that of other generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contact the Northland children who played under Hudson. They are also at a loss now, and they don't even know what happened! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Angel replied with a displeased face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long time, the nobles of the North have been the core force of the Kingdom's army. In the past, all major military operations had to go through their consent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who knew that in the blink of an eye, their influence in the army plummeted, and even the commander-in-chief couldn't find out what he was doing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that in the last war, the nobles of the Northland occupied 40% of the positions in the headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A while ago, when Marquis James was in office, they still had a lot of influence in the command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as soon as Hudson took office, the situation completely got out of control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, someone needs to be responsible for losing a battle. The commanders-in-chief of the army were all dismissed and questioned, and the other generals in the headquarters were naturally held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson played a trick to push the boat along, and replaced most of the officers in the headquarters, and the remaining generals were also labeled as guilty and meritorious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the officers who relied on their status and background were all cleaned out in this wave, and a group of more capable officers were promoted instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more fierce the competition in the early stage and the more positions it occupies, the greater the loss after adjustment in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the defenders can't shrink back is not only due to strategic needs, but also related to Hudson's personnel adjustments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if they deliberately targeted them. Anyway, the group of the five northern dukes was collectively kicked out of the power center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to make a fuss, the flames of war have reached your doorstep. In case the kingdom's army is defeated, the five families will be the first to be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the newly appointed general is not an idler, not only has a strong background, but also has a lot of military achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Over 70% of the generals are from the most famous noble legion in the kingdom—the Expeditionary Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the need to guard against the orcs, when forming the expeditionary army, the elite nobles from the northern provinces were not recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the five Dukes of the Northland were also within the scope of recruitment at first. After all, after a few more provinces, they can also be regarded as the hinterland of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they think the Western Expedition is hard work, and they are worried about the strength of their neighbors. They think that the seven provinces in northern Xinjiang cannot resist the invasion of orcs, so they try to refuse the call.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's useless to find out, Hudson is clearly targeting us deliberately. He is the coach, and there are plenty of ways to torment us!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Duke Torsten did not resonate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic judgment was half correct, and the northern nobles who missed the call would naturally have to pay the price in a new round of power reshuffle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really want to talk about targeting, it is only the Lochnard family who are pulling hatred, and the four of them are at most implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current tragic situation of the five major families is actually jointly promoted by the royal family and the aristocratic groups in the south-central provinces. Hudson alone is unable to kick them out of the core of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to paying for the arrogance of the past, the most important thing is that the military strength of the northern aristocratic group has plummeted, and its weight in the kingdom's army is not as good as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former northern nobles were synonymous with the elite in the kingdom, and the fighting power of the private army was not weaker than that of the standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has reversed. After Hudson's **** training, the combat effectiveness of the kingdom's standing army has been greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the northern aristocratic group was no longer on the front line, lost the military subsidies issued by the kingdom, and the end of the smuggling trade led to a sharp drop in financial revenue of each family, and was forced to reduce military investment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The full-time army has become half-full-time, and after a few more peaceful days, the combat effectiveness will inevitably decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After one increase and one decrease, everyone suddenly discovered that the northern aristocratic group is no longer important to the kingdom, and the original politically super-standard treatment naturally disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Caesar IV, who had wooed them before, has lost interest in them now. Politicians are always the most realistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northland aristocratic group that has lost its special value is just a few ordinary nobles. It is not worth the king to offend the old ancestors in the royal family for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing the positions of all parties, Hudson was not polite, and took advantage of the situation to pull them to their proper positions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sensitivity of the northern nobles is mainly due to their inability to adapt to their own role adjustments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps the current changes are not caused by Hudson, but from the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Foreign Affairs suddenly fell ill a few days ago, but three days ago, someone saw his chief guard appearing in the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not really sick, but has come to the front line, then everything can be explained now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the negotiations in the mainland, which need to rely on war to exert pressure, the northern battlefield is completely in a state of strategic stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, no one is sure to overwhelm the other. It is better to give each other face and stop the war first to show sincerity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If this is the case, then the situation is even worse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We were not notified of such a big deal as the negotiation, which is much more serious than being targeted by the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has seen the fighting power of the Kingdom's standing army. I have to admit that Hudson's training is really good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, now is not the same as before. Our financial revenue is limited, and it is difficult to follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training method is public, even if everyone only learns seven or eight points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a few years time, the military strength of those major fiscal and taxation provinces will also leave us behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, our situation in the kingdom will be worrying in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez said with a sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, the right to speak is linked to strength. It turns out that the nobles of the Northland are the largest military group in the kingdom, so they are naturally tough in speaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the military advantage has been wiped out, and it may even be overtaken by others, and its political status will inevitably decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's not the worst!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the training of the standing army is expensive, we can train a legion each by gritting our teeth. The Warcraft Legion is the real gold-swallowing behemoth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can't find new sources of income to supplement, we can't even keep up with the tax revenue in the territory alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think you need to worry about political treatment here. If you have this spare time, you might as well find a way to resume the smuggling trade with orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not extravagant to hope to continue to maintain an advantage over the provinces, at least we cannot fall behind. Otherwise, those enemies who were suppressed by us in the past will come out to add insult to injury! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Angel's words made Duke Torsten's face even more ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly ordinary emotion was actually a warning to him not to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the five major families are in the same spirit, but this does not mean that they are willing to get involved in the dispute between the Lochnard family and the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially during the war, it is even more tragic to be missed by the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the situation of the Lochnard family, we can see that while the front line is basically stable, they have lost troops many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that these losses are all due to coincidence, as if the Lochnard family just happened to catch up with bad luck, and actually understands everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to deliberately target, just a little stumbling within the scope of the rules is enough to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough for the Lochnard family to enjoy this kind of special treatment, and they don't want to suffer with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't dare to expect extravagance about military exploits. Now they just want to end the war quickly and send Hudson, the **** of plague, away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Oran, you are the most informed, do you know...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Earl Albert could finish speaking, Earl Oran hurriedly interrupted: \"Count Albert, you are embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all in the same situation. It's okay to inquire about general news, but I am not qualified to participate in real military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But I heard from Hudson that the king sent someone over a few days ago. Counting the days, the order to stop the attack was about the same time as their arrival. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Birds of a feather flock together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, they lost their own territory, and several frontier lords who were connected by fate naturally gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the unlucky alliance, they are the most embarrassing situation in the army. In name, they are all great nobles, but unfortunately they are big nobles who have lost their fiefs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, they should have died in the battle to defend the territory long ago. It was only under Hudson's intervention that the kingdom issued an order to retreat, which allowed them to recover their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A noble lord whose life is saved temporarily but unable to fulfill his obligations, is he considered a noble lord?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the army, they were often looked down upon, and could only behave with their tails between their legs. The right to speak had nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, he is the governor of a province, but his actual status is not as good as that of some legion commanders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone is discriminating, it's purely that the military strength of their province is not as good as that of a main army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Oran, is the news confirmed? This kind of thing is no joke!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Albert said in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is negotiating with the orcs, and it's good to be able to take back all the territory. If they can't get it back, it will be a complete tragedy for these lords who lost their land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, do I dare to joke about this kind of thing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran asked back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes continued to be staged in the military, and all powerful factions received news of the negotiations one after another, and rumors arose in the military for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who should have taken measures at the first time, not only failed to take action in time, but chose to let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delegation, which had originally concealed its identity, was soon dug out by the powerful nobles, and the enraged Minister of Foreign Affairs, Earl Francis, went straight to the headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xingshi questioned the crime, and the words came to his lips, but he didn't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, Hudson did not get involved in the negotiations, including the arrival of the delegation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't do anything, you won't make mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be too far-fetched to accuse him of leaking information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throwing the blame to a powerful marshal is a major political event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the crime is confirmed, it may not be able to do anything to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If no evidence can be found, his own political life may be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis, who regained his rationality, immediately sweated for himself, and then changed his words:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, now that the news is leaked ahead of time, I'm afraid it will affect the follow-up negotiations!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same thing, another way of saying it, has changed from provoking teachers to inquiring about crimes to discussing countermeasures together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nature has changed, and everything has changed. Regardless of how the news got out, Hudson is now dragged into the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to shirk it, as the commander of the army, you must have the responsibility of the commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the problem should not be too big. Judging from the feedback below, the voices of the main battle and the main peace are quite equal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can stabilize the situation in the army and not let them interfere with the negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the progress of your negotiations is about to speed up. No matter whether it is successful or not, you must get a result as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been delayed for a long time, and the Human Race Alliance has received news, and it will be troublesome to intervene! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he deliberately dug a hole, it's just that there are some blames that he can't bear. When negotiating with the elves earlier, Hudson had the courage to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the orcs are different, they are the kingdom's sworn enemies. The fact that the Chinese can tolerate compromises with the elves does not mean that they can also accept compromises with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the Kingdom's army has not gained an absolute advantage, and hastily started negotiations with the orcs. It is difficult to achieve satisfactory results for all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, old accounts were turned over. These are ready-made excuses for political opponents, and Hudson does not want to end up with a notorious end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply played \"non-participation, ignorance, non-interference\" and allowed the situation to develop freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for worrying about the intervention of the Terran Alliance, it is purely an excuse to urge the delegation to speed up the progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Message delivery also takes time, and Hudson doesn't think anyone would dare to activate the magic circle of communication under his nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are spies placed by major forces in the army, it is very difficult to pass the news out. After all, the military camp is not a place where you can come and go freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they escaped from the barracks by chance, the surrounding area of ​​a hundred miles was cleared by solid walls, and it was difficult to find someone to connect with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the cooperation of the great nobles, it would not be possible in a short time to spread the news from the Northern Continent to the Southern Continent without exposing themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, what is spreading now is only rumors, and there is no solid evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beastmen are not as expensive as elves, and the death of vassal races will not affect the high-level decision-making.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Randomly fighting a few symbolic battles on the border can make all parties speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the current Alpha Kingdom has been geographically separated by the alien coalition forces, and the human race alliance has little binding force on the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, don't worry. According to the preliminary contact, the orcs want to end the war sooner than we do. The negotiation is progressing very smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is just to regain lost ground, an armistice treaty can be signed now. The current dispute between the two sides is the issue of war compensation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis' words made Hudson call it sloppy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the orcs, there is no need for an armistice treaty, and what is being discussed now is clearly an armistice treaty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as one side is ready, the war will break out again. Since it is only a short-term truce, some issues can be blurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the current Orc Empire doesn't have the ability to develop so much territory, so it's not a big problem to let the Alpha Kingdom occupy it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the eyes of the orcs, allowing the Alpha nobles to develop the prairie is to cultivate leeks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these densely packed fortresses, the emerging nobles are still easy to grab. This time it was mainly because of their misjudgment and mistake, they did not expect the Kingdom to retreat voluntarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering a loss once, they will be prepared for the next war. The emerging nobles in the border areas will not be so smooth if they want to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It takes time for the development of the territory. If the seven provinces of Northern Xinjiang want to develop to the level of the five major families in the Northland, it will be difficult to do it without 180 years of hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the support of the kingdom, relying on the territory's own blood production, God knows that the year of the monkey can develop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the future of northern Xinjiang is a big pit. Once you're in, don't even think about getting out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every year when the orc tribe comes to fight \"Grass Valley\", they can beat them to death. It is difficult for the local noble lords to organize an effective counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this kind of hard life cannot be ended in a day or two. It must be persisted until the kingdom recovers and is able to launch the \"Eastern Expedition\" before it can end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, it is the \"Eastern Expedition\", not the \"Northern Expedition\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the map, after the Alpha Kingdom regained the seven provinces in the northern border, the orc empire not only existed in the north of the kingdom, but more territory was in the east of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of the mainland, this place still belongs to the Northern Continent, and the war launched is naturally the \"Northern Expedition\". After adjusting the perspective to the northern part of the kingdom, there are two options for future wars: \"Northern Expedition\" and \"Eastern Expedition\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The climate in the east is more suitable for human survival, and the land is more fertile. The five royal families of the orcs are all entrenched here. To go deep into the prairie and fight the orcs, it is natural to focus on the east.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to call it conveniently, Hudson took a new term \"Near East\" from the kingdom's seven northern provinces all the way to Xueyue Lake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's best if the negotiations go smoothly. If the war ends as soon as possible, the kingdom will be able to recuperate as soon as possible.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has already said countless times \"Fuck\". If nothing else, the delegation is now insisting on asking for land from the orcs, mainly to honor the land bonds issued by the previous kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the quality of the land, how to solve the security problem, and whether the creditors can gain a firm foothold after obtaining the land, most of them are ignored by the bureaucrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gets enough land from the negotiating table, and after satisfying the rewards for the meritorious ministers, it can still cash in the previous land bonds, and then it can stop the mouths of the main fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very skeptical about the ownership of these lands, which will be blurred in the treaties, and the orcs only need to temporarily cede control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow-up questions, let's deal with it after the next war breaks out!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only this kind of ambiguous treaty that does not need to bear infamy or political consequences can be reached by the two parties in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has laid hidden dangers for the future situation in the Near East, and that is only a small problem. Anyway, there are a lot of conflicts between the Alpha Kingdom and the orcs, some of them are fuses, and it doesn't matter if there is one more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ones who are cheated are the next owners of these lands. Maybe just after it was sealed, the orcs came to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps there will be a classic saying in the future kingdom: \"Whoever has enmity with you, let him go to northern Xinjiang to be the lord.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remarks: For convenience, some Eurasian maps are used. The Orc Empire is now almost cutting off the African part of the Ottoman Empire, the Black Sea has shrunk into a lake, and further east is the sea.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even though the nobles knew that the negotiation had started, it didn't affect everyone's confusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for convincing the main combat faction is very simple. A list of the kingdom's logistics supplies and a list of daily supplies consumed by the army shut up all the nobles clamoring to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All corresponded, and everyone was strictly prohibited from attacking. It wasn't that their Marshal Hudson changed, it was completely dragged down by logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you urge, it is useless. The large amount of supplies that the kingdom has stockpiled on the front line is gone, and the current transportation capacity can only barely catch up with the daily consumption of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, the Expeditionary Corps went deep into the enemy's rear, in addition to causing damage, it was also to let the logistics department take a breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Expeditionary Corps is a big consumer of supplies. It seems that there are only more than 30,000 people, but the actual material consumption is equivalent to 200,000 infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis is tragic. The Huozhuan faction, who was full of suffocation, vented their grievances on him, the unlucky guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the main combat faction scolded him for being incompetent, but also the main peace faction. Immediately, the official documents impeaching him flew to the capital like snowflakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not surprising that the two factions are unified. Based on the relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the orcs, there is no real peace faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Lord and the main reason are that there is no hope of winning, and they want to end the war quickly after weighing the pros and cons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many generals, the reason for the current passive situation is the improper employment of the kingdom. If Marshal Hudson had been brought over earlier, there would have been no early failures at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No city or land will be lost, no soldiers will be lost, and the strategic materials hoarded by the kingdom in advance will not be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is different, and the choices made are naturally different. Only fools can negotiate with them if they can defeat the orc empire!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turmoil subsided, except for Marquis James.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Caesar IV had chosen to deal with it coldly, trying to downplay the previous defeat as much as possible. Now that he has been dealt with by a bunch of impeachment documents, it is impossible to handle it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden change, Hudson just laughed it off. If he didn't follow him, it was already for the sake of the friendship of colleagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just took the opportunity to sound the alarm for all parties. Some guys in the province were restless and always stared at his position to replace him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, there is news from the Kingdom that the Central Continent ceased fighting half a month ago!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this news, Hudson was slightly taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half a month ago, if you count the time, the Kingdom delegation was still on the way, and the war in the Central Continent stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a neighbor, it took so long for the news to spread, which is obviously the result of the deliberate blockade of the Three Kingdoms of the Central Mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that when receiving this news, the people in power all over the continent were as confused as he was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It came too suddenly. It is clear that you are killing each other on the battlefield, but suddenly the war ceases, and everyone needs time to relax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opening the map of Central China, looking at the spheres of influence currently controlled by all parties, combined with the military report he received before, Hudson suddenly understood why the two warring parties had ceased fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War serves politics, and politics is driven by interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the cost of war exceeds the benefit, both warring parties need to think twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of national interests, the Alpha Kingdom can negotiate with the old enemy orcs, and the three countries in the mainland can naturally compromise with the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just different from the meaningless consumption of the northern battlefield. The alien alliance has an absolute advantage in the middle mainland battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the price to be paid to stop the war is definitely not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without knowing the specific situation, Hudson cannot judge whether the decisions of the three countries in China are right or wrong. The only thing that is certain is: stop the war now, and preserve the foundation for the three kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send for Earl Francis.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson then ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happened, the next thing is to see how the Terran Alliance responds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If tough measures can be taken immediately to pull the Three Kingdoms back into the chariot in time, then the kingdom's plan will remain the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Terran Alliance is not strong enough in this regard, the kingdom doesn't need to continue to hide and pinch, just follow the trend and end the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the alliance representing the entire human race is the human race alliance. The alliance controlled by various forces in the Southern Continent can only be regarded as the Human Race Alliance of the Southern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's embarrassing to think about it. From the outbreak of the continental war to the present, dozens of countries have been destroyed in the human race, but only two kingdoms have been destroyed in the foreign race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a record, no one thinks that the human race is a loser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race did not lose, but the small countries in the Northern Continent and the Central Continent lost a clean slate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two major alliances fight to the end, they still have a slight possibility of \"recovering the country\". Once the two sides choose to cease fighting and compromise, nothing will happen to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the factions in the Southern Continent are winners, the difference is only in how much they win and how little they win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the Frankish Kingdom is now winning the most. It not only annexed the half-orc kingdom, but also gathered a large number of immigrants. After the war, it will usher in a period of rising strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ilibia and the Holy See also achieved good results. The former annexed the territory of the ogre, and the latter used religious means to control a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss eats meat, and the younger brothers drink soup. It is estimated that the rest of the Southern Continent countries will also get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are gains and sacrifices, and wars always kill people. This kind of life-and-death racial war, even if it is a winner, will not pay a small price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the Human Race Coalition Army has been unable to be formed is largely due to the fact that the major forces in the Southern Continent suffered too much losses in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly occupied area is not peaceful, and a large number of troops need to be left to suppress the remnants of the alien race. There are not many mobile troops that can be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the shortage of troops, it is estimated that strategic materials will not be rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, it will take a lot of time to raise enough supplies for a million-strong army, even if all parties unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Southern Continent was completely victorious, while the Central Continent suffered a blood loss. The small country was directly wiped out, and the three big countries were also trembling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield in the North Continent is the most special. The seven countries of the grassland and several small countries in the west are all big losers. Whether the Alpha Kingdom and the Moshi Principality can become winners depends on whether the Warhammer Kingdom can be restored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to make up for the loss from the foreign race, so the only option is to inherit the legacy of the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, whether Hudson and Caesar IV can become winners depends on whether the Principality of Moxi can inherit part of the legacy of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Alpha Kingdom, there is no possibility of expanding westward at all. While displaying prestige on the battlefield, it also inevitably arouses fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the intention to advance westward is revealed, not only the alliance between the elves and the ancient survivors will break out, but even the little brother of the Principality of Moxi will not be able to stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom continues to develop northward, and it is what all parties want to see most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, the door of the conference room of the Terran Alliance Parliament has just opened, and the pressure that greets the representatives is overwhelming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The parliament has not been peaceful these days. Every time a general meeting is held, quarrels are inevitable, and in many cases, full-scale martial arts will be staged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tables, chairs, benches and so on are basically changed once a meeting is held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the representatives of the countries in the central and northern parts of the mainland, the anger is getting bigger and bigger. In many cases, the table is scrapped directly after the heated debate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened more frequently, and the \"sponsors\" with deep pockets couldn't stand it. In a rage, Charles III simply replaced the high-end custom made by the artist with ordinary goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the grade was lowered, Charles III didn't care anymore. They are all ordinary goods worth a few silver coins, whatever the hell, the Frankish Kingdom has plenty of wood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, the Holy See was the most viciously scolded. Several kingdoms in the Southern Continent were responsible for sharing the firepower. Today it is obvious that the protagonist will be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Central Continent, where the fight is the most intense, suddenly announced a truce!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received this shocking news, everyone's first reaction was to not believe it, but after many confirmations, everyone can only face the reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host, Charles III chose to be absent again. There is no way, those congressmen are too crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time they appear on the stage, a group of congressmen gather around to urge the Frankish Kingdom to send troops to help them recover the mountains and rivers, but the problem is that the investment is not directly proportional to the income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those representatives who have no hope of restoring the country, they behaved the most outrageously, and it seemed that they were about to break the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Porcelain against rubble is not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case any congressman can't think about it, he directly hijacks his king and forces the Frankish Kingdom to send troops, then it will be a lot of fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar farce has already appeared. There was a councilor in front of him who was beaten black and blue in the parliament because he opposed sending troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host of the meeting, Duke Bergson, who slowly walked into the meeting room, was also under great pressure at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have Count Onofre of the Kingdom of South Coast, Count Cyrus of the Kingdom of Dante, and Count Miles of the Kingdom of Hesse arrived?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, his eyes wandered around the hall, but unfortunately the three of them were nowhere to be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Earls of Onofre, Cyrus, and Miles have just sent people here to ask for leave. It is said that the old illness has relapsed. Now they are unconscious and cannot attend today's meeting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guard hurriedly ran from outside and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The members of the House of Representatives who heard the news were furious. Everyone had organized their language and were waiting for the representatives of the three countries to arrive. They asked them for an explanation, but they never expected that the people would not come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this excuse for asking for leave made everyone complain. The representatives of the Three Kingdoms fell into a coma due to a relapse of an old illness, which was an insult to everyone's IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, there was constant scolding in the hall, especially the representatives of the betrayed small countries in Mainland China, who were the most devoted to scolding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if the truce is over, bring everyone along!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they can restore the country, they don't mind pretending that nothing happened. The matter was done without even a notice, and the Three Kingdoms obviously gave up on their little brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a rational point of view, the three countries in mainland China are too busy to take care of themselves, and it is normal for them to be unable to take care of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a party, it is doomed to be impossible to be rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of representatives clamored to hold the Three Kingdoms accountable for their private affair with the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that apart from being loud, these people have actually lost the right to speak, and they can't initiate a proposal vote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the positions of several major forces are very clear, and they cannot be led by the nose by a group of destroyed small countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were not kicked out of the Terran Alliance, it was because everyone scrupled about eating and maintaining the legal system of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Alliance Council closes this time, these representatives who cannot represent anyone will no longer be members of the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the chaotic venue, Duke Bergson immediately shouted: \"Silence!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guards maintain order, and anyone who makes noise and makes trouble will be thrown out by me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decent or not, he no longer cares about so many things. This is a place for discussion, not a place for these people to vent their emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know some people are in a bad mood, but it happened and we have to move on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representatives from the Kingdom of Hesse, the Kingdom of Dante, and the Kingdom of South Shore were absent, so the meeting had to be held normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the members of the presidium are starting to discuss, and the rest please keep quiet first. If you have any ideas, wait until it is your turn to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you intend to make trouble, according to the alliance's parliamentary act, the bureau has the right to investigate your membership, including disqualification! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked threat, but the effect is exceptionally good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are lucky, and they will not really give up until the last moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking a can is actually a political statement in itself. After all, a crying child has candy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let me start first, compromise with the alien alliance privately, this is a betrayal of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse, the Kingdom of Dante, and the Kingdom of the South Bank only care about their own interests and ignore the overall situation of the human race. We must severely punish them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being scolded for so long, someone finally came out to spread hatred. While he was relieved, he was also taking the opportunity to vent the grievances he had accumulated recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of the truce in the Central Mainland, the Holy See can actually do not much. It's okay to shout a few words, but if they really want to send troops to punish them, the alien alliance will probably laugh out loud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, when you say this, won't your conscience hurt!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Predrag said with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he is a professional in dismantling the stage of the Holy See, and he is full of sarcasm as soon as he opens his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes have long been familiar to everyone. Almost every time an alliance meeting is held, there will be: Holy See VS Alpha Kingdom, Holy See VS Frankish Kingdom, Frankish Kingdom VS Iliban Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a very few issues where the Quartet can unify their positions, most of the time these fixed-talk combinations will argue a few words with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a meaningless quarrel, but it is actually a manifestation of political wisdom. The big forces also need to gain a sense of presence. While fighting against each other, they are also reminding the representatives that their status is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the composition of the combination, you can tell that the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See are on the same level, and Ilibia and the Alpha Kingdom are on the other side. Everyone defaults that the four countries have more say in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the last orc invasion, the Three Kingdoms of the Middle Mainland, who were still impatient, once tried to challenge the status of the Alpha Kingdom, and made good progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan has not been completed yet, and the new round of continental war will directly bring them back to their original shape. On the contrary, the military strength displayed by the Alpha Kingdom was astonishing, and it consolidated its position in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what we are discussing now is the issue of the three countries in the mainland. If you feel that your conscience is disturbed, you can send troops to follow the retreat of the elf army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I believe that as long as your country can do this, the crisis in the Central Continent will be solved immediately, and at the same time, the victory will be established for the human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson counterattacked tit-for-tat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you must use your brain when you speak, and don't treat people as fools!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Predrag sent a blank stare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the issue of interests, the contract alone is an insurmountable problem. Where is it copying the back of the elf army? It is clear that they want the lives of all the high-level people in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who dares to make such a deadly suggestion in the kingdom will immediately be labeled as a chaotic party, and then dragged out and snapped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a disturbance, the original chilling atmosphere also faded. The representatives who calmed down also realized how unreliable it is to pursue the responsibility of the three kingdoms of Hesse, Dante, and South Bank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if accountability is required, it will have to be delayed until after the war. If the continental war is not over, if a civil war is provoked, I am afraid that the alien alliance will wake up from its dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In order to save time, I don't think the presidium needs to discuss it, just vote directly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the three countries involved are absent, they will be counted as abstaining. Anyway, the loss of their three votes will not affect the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, the previous Warhammer Kingdom split, and the ownership of the presidium is undecided. That vote should also be counted as abstention! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Djordevich's laughing words made the councilors from the Warhammer Kingdom fall into an ice cave, and the leader, Earl Derek, fell to his seat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to leave the bureau, but it is difficult to come back. Without the right to speak in the alliance, their road to recovery will become more bumpy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is the reality. They have no grievances with the Kingdom of Libya, and Count Djordevich has no need to deliberately target them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now being forced to withdraw, mainly the Warhammer Kingdom in exile, is unable to fulfill the obligations of the members of the bureau, and naturally cannot continue to exercise the power of the members of the bureau.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top ten kingdoms in the mainland plus the Holy See. There were only eleven members in the original council presidium, but now it has directly become ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number is likely to continue to decrease. The several kingdoms that are falling, as well as the three countries in the middle mainland that have been brutally beaten, are at risk of being kicked out in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just look at the voting weights of all parties. The same seats represent different forces and have different voices in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since there is no objection, let's simply reduce the procedure and go to the vote directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who support the severe punishment of the members of the presidium of the three countries in mainland China, please raise your right hand, those who oppose please raise your left hand, and those who do not raise their hands will be counted as abstentions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Bergson said simply and rudely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, he raised his left hand first. With such a clear statement, the intentional tendency could not be more obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is an interest. The Kingdom of Frankish is struggling, and needs to digest the fruits of victory next. Now sending troops to expel the aliens and help these unlucky people to restore their country will not even see the rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the next continental war breaks out, these originally owned lands will be washed away by foreigners and become unowned lands again. Whoever grabs them will belong to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, a group of presidium members participated in the voting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprise, the two kingdoms, Ilibia and Alpha, who needed time to digest the results of the battle, also voted against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that made everyone feel unbelievable was that Bishop Montesson, who had just clamored to severely punish the Three Kingdoms, also voted against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the representatives of Ruthenia, Avalat, and Oprus, who had been silent all along, voted in favor of the vote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that there are smart people in the Three Kingdoms, who have seen the coming of the era of great mergers, and want to delay the expansion of several major forces by supporting the restoration of the destroyed countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, their own strength is limited, and their voice in the league is not high. Even if it is aware of the danger, it is powerless to stop it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this alien invasion has also untied the shackles on the heads of several major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly playing mergers within the human race, it is easy to be encircled. Genocide cannot be played in a civil war. Without legal support, post-war governance will be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now don't worry, the enemy helped finish the purge. In the future, there will be no people in these lands. As long as the alien race is eliminated, everything will be settled.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is true that the war in northern Xinjiang has not really ended, and a group of high-level generals cannot return to the capital to participate in the discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a shareholder of the kingdom, even if people can't drive back, they have to express their position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid suspicion, Hudson also invited Earl Francis, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who was in charge of negotiations, to come here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue involved is too big, so it must be done with caution. Among the thirty-two provinces of the kingdom, there are eighteen governors on the front line. It is conceivable how much influence this meeting had on the kingdom's final decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having full wings doesn't mean you have to jump out and fight against the king. Hudson is not going to set foot in court, as long as he maintains the right to speak in the army is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson extends his tentacles to the political arena again, I am afraid that Caesar IV will not be able to sleep peacefully for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I think everyone has received the news of the truce in Central China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was no need to convene everyone to discuss this kind of matter, but last night, the Kingdom's ambassador to Frank activated the magic circle of communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The latest round of the Terran Alliance Council has made a decision not to impose sanctions on the three countries of the Central Mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The proposal for a truce with the alien alliance was also proposed, but it was rejected by the alliance because of too much opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone should know what this means!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continental war is coming to an end, and it is time for the kingdom to make a decision. If you have any thoughts, please take this opportunity to speak up! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is expected. The major forces of the human race are now full and lack the motivation to continue the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the alien alliance is similar. Except for the two unlucky ones who were destroyed, the rest of the races have gained a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The winners have achieved phased victories, and it is difficult to obtain greater benefits if they continue to fight. Naturally, it is time to settle down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great powers don't want war, and no matter how much a group of ruined small countries shout, they can't change the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not start truce negotiations with the alien alliance immediately, it was because of the influence of several giants that they deliberately took care of the positions of the representatives of the small countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like I don't know, I'm startled by counting. The Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland + the Warhammer Kingdom of East and West + the Principality of Orton + the Duke of Ruilin + the Duke of Kantruo + the Duke of Ustad + the Duke of Fick + the Duke of Glint + the Duke of Nadal, there are sixteen countries in the northern continent alone. destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combining the fifteen unlucky ones in the Central Continent, a continental war directly buried thirty-one human countries, a new record in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the alliance doesn't want to fight now, what about the countries that unfortunately perished in the war?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero asked eagerly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not about the life and death of countries, but the handling of this matter will directly affect the future international situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the destroyed countries cannot be restored, then only the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi will remain in the Northern Continent, and even the land transportation to the Central Continent will be cut off by alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of military common sense knows how much pressure the kingdom will face on defense next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, there will be alien races in the west of the kingdom, alien races in the south, and the northern border will be a powder keg. The scene is unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm not very familiar with diplomatic issues. Count Francis should answer this question!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who asks, Marshal Hudson doesn't understand diplomacy today. Perhaps for a long time to come, he will show others that he does not understand diplomacy or politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether you believe it or not, it doesn't matter at all. On many political issues, the form is more important than the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This gesture was mainly for the king and royalists, showing that he has no intention of being a minister in power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the war is over, resign from your post and return to the territory with the benefits you deserve, the matter will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Caesar IV's mind is not broken, he will push Hudson to a \"moral high position\" to confess, and the various political storms and power reshuffles in the country will try to avoid involving him as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless there is a candidate in the army who can replace Hudson, this detached position will continue until the kingdom's strategic hidden danger disappears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Hero, there is a deviation in your understanding. The continental war will stop, and it will continue for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if an armistice treaty is signed, it will only be in the dark. On the surface, the human race will not recognize every inch of land occupied by the foreign race alliance, and the foreign race alliance will also not recognize the achievements of our human race countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the countries that were destroyed, it is very regrettable. In the future, all parties will downplay this topic, and even the Human Race Alliance Council will not be held again in a short time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis' explanation shocked everyone. It never occurred to me that the alliance representing the interests of the human race could actually do such a shattering thing, which is completely challenging everyone's perception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one who didn't respond was Hudson in the main seat. He has seen many strange operations. The choice of the Terran Alliance is already considered responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially in this war, the two sides will win and lose each other. From the perspective of the long-term interests of the race, the human race still has an advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alien Alliance now looks majestic and powerful, but in fact it is leaking everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multi-ethnic alliances are reluctant to share adversity, let alone share wealth. Even if the various races are able to suppress conflicts due to the threat of the human race, strategically they still lack a stable rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no trace of them in the southern continent, and the middle and northern continents are not completely occupied by them. If the various clans cannot recover their strength quickly, the next continental war will be their end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Francis, according to this inference, does it also mean that the next chaos in the northern continent can only be faced by ourselves?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Zuel asked nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the Human Race Alliance, facing the chaos in the Northern Continent alone, the kingdom is facing more serious defense pressure than it was five years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five years ago, facing the mighty Orc Empire, only a number of provinces in the north were directly threatened, but now they are being threatened by alien races on multiple fronts at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom's rear, the southwestern provinces directly became the front line. This sudden reversal really challenges people's nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency's judgment is basically correct. The human race alliance has deteriorated, and now we can't count on it at all. The situation in the northern continent will mainly be supported by the kingdom alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi can share part of the pressure for us, but more often than not, they still need the support of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Earl Francis directly explained the embarrassing situation of the kingdom in diplomacy. This is not because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not work hard, but because of geopolitics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the atmosphere was not right, Hudson knew that everyone was frightened. No matter how well-informed and well-informed, the situation can't stand the rapid deterioration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't have to worry too much, this change in the mainland is not only a challenge for the kingdom, but also an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the problems faced by the Kingdom separately, it is actually not as bad as everyone expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Warhammer Kingdom in the northwest was destroyed, nearly half of its territory was still controlled by the human race. The ancient survivors were destroyed by us, and the trauma left by the war is enough for them to survive for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The areas of several small countries in the southwest line are temporarily controlled by the elf army, and we are not sure about the ownership issue for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Presumably it was either handed over to a certain alien race in Central China, or it was annexed by the elves. No matter who we hand it over to, the pressure we face will not be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are sparsely populated, and it is impossible to station a large number of troops on the border. As long as the lords on the border are honest and don't let the slave traders go to make trouble, it is rare to encounter an elf invasion in a hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    falls into the hands of other alien races, so there is no need to worry. We fight on multiple fronts, and they are also neighbors of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of military strength, apart from the elves, orcs, and dwarves that are worthy of fear among the alien races, none of them are opponents of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only unsolvable ones are the orcs, and I don't think everyone has thought about reconciling with the orcs. As long as the foreign races don't come together, the kingdom can still stand alone against the severely weakened orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    End the war as soon as possible, and recuperate with the people. The next thing everyone competes is recovery speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not wanting to fall into strategic passiveness in the future, the kingdom must launch an Eastern Expedition campaign on the prairie before the five royal families regain their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Francis, tell everyone the result of the negotiation, so that they can feel at ease! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some words are enough to comfort others, but you can't follow them. The aliens are not stupid, how could they watch the Alpha Kingdom deal with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since its establishment, the Alpha Kingdom has been strategically passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Local wars can also be manipulated. Once a full-scale war is launched against the orcs, the alien alliance will definitely intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said unceremoniously that in the days to come, the nobles of the kingdom must live frugally and carry out the war to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The negotiations went very smoothly, the orcs agreed to return all the territory of the kingdom and retreat at least 500 miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculated from the agreed time, at this time, the orc army is already on the way to evacuate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war in the northern border is over. In a short time, you don't have to worry about the threat of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orc army withdraws, the entire Near East region will be brought under the rule of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, the kingdom will rebuild the defense line in the northern border. If you have any ideas, you can bring them to the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Earl Francis hadn't mentioned the ownership of sovereignty, Hudson would have thought it was a miracle in the history of diplomacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this benefit comes with bubbles. Whether the Near East can be included in the kingdom's rule depends mainly on strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contraction of the orc empire does not mean that they are afraid, but a strategic need. Today is different from the past, the army has been confronting the border for a long time, and the orc empire simply cannot afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply retreat a little more, leaving a vacuum area. Anyway, now their population has declined sharply, and a large area of ​​land is deserted and neglected, not bad for the land on the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the land is lost to the Alpha Kingdom, it will not be able to develop it for a while. When you regain your strength, you can grab it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, a group of high-ranking generals reacted one after another. But even knowing that there is a pit, it doesn't affect the kingdom's choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land bonds issued need to be honored, and the meritorious officials need to be rewarded, all of which require land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of this war is not big, there are not so many unclaimed lands in the country, everyone can only come to the Near East to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can gain a firm foothold is a matter for the future. Let's solve the immediate problems first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel took a longing look at the camp of the orc army, and heaved a deep sigh as the camp was constantly being demolished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the empire chose to temporarily avoid the enemy's edge. He couldn't understand whether it was right or wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that there is a voice in his heart that keeps reminding him that it will be difficult to revisit the old place after retreating now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, many problems were suppressed. Now that the war is over, it's time to erupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first to bear the brunt was the Bimon Imperial Court, which was sparsely populated, and was eaten by an expeditionary army during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of 20,000 to 30,000 members of other big clans may not be a big deal, but for the Bimeng clan, it is a serious injury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their population had already been severely reduced. Now that this wave is happening again, the number of remaining tribesmen is actually only one-third of what it was five years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small number of clansmen, no matter how strong their fighting power is, they cannot suppress the ambitious people below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the current Beamon Army is not the former Beamon Army. In order to ensure the number of troops, they were forced to turn all the people into soldiers, at the cost of a plummeting combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Behemoth Legion at its peak, although it is not as good as the Warcraft Legion created by the Alpha Kingdom, it will definitely be richer if it is exchanged with ordinary soldiers in the Expeditionary Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation is reversed. With the same strength, the Beamon cavalry whose combat effectiveness has declined will suffer a lot when they encounter the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, delivered directly to your door. If the powerful races below do not attack the position of the imperial court, they deserve to be cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other four royal families were able to Rabbimon once, but they couldn't pull them a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you keep supporting them, it will cut off the hope of all the tribes below. The dissatisfaction accumulated by the various clans has nowhere to vent, and will eventually surge towards the five royal clans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't make any sense to talk about the overall situation with the cannon fodder race that has been squeezed for a long time. Anyway, they are not vested interests, no matter how bad the situation is, that's all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the Beamon emperor Alex, who proposed at the meeting that \"the orc empire needs a major reform\", Daniel shook his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problems exposed by the empire have been thoroughly studied by everyone. The call for reform has always existed. But when it came to specific actions, everyone was dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families who hold the right to speak are all vested interests under the current rule system. Reform is cutting one's own flesh to meet the interests of the various ethnic groups below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Come on, Daniel!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Empires have failed dozens of times here, and it doesn't hurt to add one more. Facing a stubborn enemy like the Alpha Kingdom, you must learn to adapt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it is time to let go, you must let go. We failed this time, and we still have next time, and next time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation on the mainland is very beneficial to the empire. We will not fight alone when wars are waged in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said encouragingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He valued this son very much. Although he failed to defeat Hudson, Daniel's command ability is still second to none in the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selecting a capable successor is of great strategic significance for stabilizing the status of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan. Can't let Daniel be crippled by blows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, father! I can still bear some setbacks. I'm just thinking about domestic affairs now.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel's words calmed down the uneasy heart of the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good if you haven't been knocked down. Only after experiencing setbacks can you grow better. Famous generals are tempered from adversity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't think too much, domestic issues are already very complicated. If you think too much, things will become more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turmoil lasted for a while, but it still didn't affect us. When the situation is unclear, it is better to wait and see the situation first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how advanced the mobilization mechanism of the Alpha Kingdom is, it cannot change the fact that productivity is lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the last orc invasion, all sides were fighting over the spoils right after the war. This time, everyone's interest was significantly lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, there have been quite a few nobles looking for activities in Hudson, but the targets they are aiming at are all homeless lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land in the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang, everyone looks disgusted, let alone the more remote \"Near East\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the land is fertile or not is not important at all. Being so close to the shortcoming of the Orc Empire made all the nobles daunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you like fiefdoms, you can't fill them with your life!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the relationship between the kingdom and the orcs, peace will only take three to five years at most. After the orcs get over their breath, the border area will definitely be in trouble again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the threat of orcs all the time, it also develops the production of shit. The daily harassment of the orcs alone can collapse the territory's economy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the previous practice of the nobles in the Northland, the land in the border area is directly abandoned, and the main fiscal revenue of the territory is only three: Kingdom subsidies, smuggling trade, and slave trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The income of the territory does not seem to be low, but the money is only passed from the lord, and will soon be invested in armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peaceful times, it is still possible to achieve a balance of payments. Once a war breaks out, there will be a fiscal deficit immediately, and bankruptcy is common.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the Northland dominate. In addition to their black hands, the financial problems that plague the small and medium-sized nobles are also an important driving force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small and medium-sized nobles who lack the ability to resist risks simply cannot survive round after round of orc invasions, and their decline is only a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countless lessons learned from the past, and it is hard to get a chance to take the fief. No one wants to jump into the huge pit in the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are the middle and small nobles lacking in love, but even the great nobles in the kingdom lack interest in the land of the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the previous purchase of the kingdom's land bonds, that was forced and helpless. During the war, everyone can't watch the government's finances go bankrupt!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on \"land bonds\", the Ministry of Finance divested most of the kingdom's debts, but the \"shareholders\" became the receivers of the debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Hudson, the proposer, who took the initiative to set an example, and the share of bonds subscribed was second only to the king, I am afraid that he would be beaten when he went out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson believes that there are absolutely many noble lords who want to beat him up. There is no practice, mainly because everyone knows that they can't win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the country avoid the Near East, but Hudson knows very well that no matter how big the pit in the Near East is, the kingdom must bring this land into its rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inside story of the armistice, as long as the high-level officials know. When promoting to the outside world, the kingdom must be a victorious country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war did not end after gaining an absolute advantage on the battlefield. Just relying on an armistice treaty that cannot be publicized cannot prove that the Alpha Kingdom is a victorious country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on political needs, the kingdom must also expand its territory. Even if the newly added land is really poisonous, the kingdom can only swallow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Externally, this is to prove to the Human Race Alliance that the Alpha Kingdom is determined to fight against alien races, and there is absolutely no rumor of \"begging\" from the alien race alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internally, this is an explanation to countless soldiers and civilians, proving that everyone's blood was not shed in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only by defeating the Orc Empire independently can this mountain that has been weighing on everyone's hearts for a long time be lifted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Propaganda a few more times to make the victory deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. When the next big war breaks out, everyone will no longer be afraid of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the Earl of Oran is visiting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the guard pulled Hudson out of his contemplation. The current situation of the Holliser family is not so bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fief was recovered, but the losses caused by the war could not be recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of citizens has dropped sharply, all farmland has been abandoned, and a large amount of infrastructure has been destroyed. What they have to do now is to rebuild the territory on the ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wealth of the veteran nobles is not unlimited. The early development of the territory has consumed a lot of their manpower, material resources, and financial resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this process, a lot of network resources are also consumed. The value of these intangible losses is greater than direct economic losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rebuilding the territory is easy to say. If it is really implemented, it is bound to pay a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the short-term situation, the Holliser family's northward strategy has failed so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consuming the heritage accumulated by the family for countless years, they reaped ruins, which is a complete blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Oran's purpose, he can basically guess, is nothing more than to seek support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Holliser family, if there is no support, it is very likely that they will sink and fall again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. In the aristocratic circle, interests are always paramount, and those who don't realize this will be eliminated by the world sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As in-laws and political allies, the Koslow family and the Holliser family have gotten very close in recent years, and they have helped each other a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this war, two families with no conflict of core interests, supporting each other and moving forward together, would have become a good story in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the situation changed too quickly. Even though Hudson had reached out to help the nobles in the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang, the Holliser family was still severely injured in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy losses did not affect the existence of the alliance, but the balance of power between the two sides was broken, and the original mutual support became a unilateral output.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, it will not affect the relationship between the two families, but the favor will eventually run out one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a generation, if the Holliser family has not improved, the two parties will only have a relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people will use favors at critical moments instead of consuming them at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During these days on the front line, apart from the normal exchange of feelings and information, Earl Oran did not ask him, and Hudson took care of him on his own initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the kingdom's military focus will definitely shift. The orcs are the kingdom's biggest enemy, but they are not the only enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those border provinces will definitely jump out to compete for defense resources, and the nobles in neighboring provinces will most likely support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom will definitely approve the Near East defense plan you are promoting, but it is difficult to say how much you will invest in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the lessons of this war, many people in the kingdom have doubts about the kingdom's \"Northward Strategy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, none of the nobles who came to me for activities went to the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Focus on building the Near East line of defense, the prerequisite is someone first. The plan can only be implemented if a large number of nobles are entrusted to the past and enough people are filled in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your four provinces of Northern Xinjiang and the five Dukes of the Northland jointly proposed a joint proposal to mobilize personal connections to build momentum. It seems that the momentum is huge, but in fact there is no possibility of passing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can get the full support of the royal family, there may still be a chance of passing. However, there is a high probability that the resources that can be obtained in the end will still be lower than your expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is short of financial resources, and the nobles and lords everywhere are also poor. Everyone needs time to recuperate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without reservation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building the \"Near East Line of Defense\" was still proposed by him. The failure to promote the implementation is mainly due to the indifference of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to go to the Near East, so we can't leave the work of building the defense line to the bureaucrats of the kingdom, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Protracted investment, involving tens of millions of money and food, Hudson did not dare to bet on the ethics of bureaucrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The embankment of a thousand miles collapses in the ant nest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the defense line depends on the weak area of ​​the defense line. Negligence in any place will cause irreparable consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The integrity of noble lords is also not guaranteed. But the lives of the whole family are tied to the defense line, and if there is a problem with the defense line, they will be buried with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The county guards, governors above, and the fate of the whole family are also linked to the defense line, so don't worry about them not being responsible for supervision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't solve people's problems, everything is empty talk. But in this regard, the nobles in the northern Xinjiang area are helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a shortage of people in their own fief, so how can they continue to develop the Near East!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called building the Near East line of defense, in fact, they only have one mouth. The money, food, and population required for the specific implementation process must be paid by the nobles in the central and southern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I understand what you mean. The Near East is a big pit now, and it's normal for everyone to have emotional resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I could choose again, I would rather take my clansmen to Fengyun Province to participate in the competition than to gain a foothold in the ghostly place of Northern Xinjiang!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has developed to this point, the price paid by the Holliser family is too great, and I am not allowed to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emerging nobles in northern Xinjiang are in a similar situation at present. Everyone is a red-eyed gambler, and they have lost their last fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are determined to take the Koslow family further, then now is the best opportunity. As long as the situation in northern Xinjiang can be stabilized, everyone will push you up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only by integrating the power of the provinces in the northern border, you are the real chess player in the kingdom. No matter how high someone praises her now, it is only a false name after all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't rush to refuse, there are too many nobles in the kingdom who want you to come to the Near East. After the war, when the meritorious ministers were canonized, there must be an enclave for you in the Near East. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes being too capable is also a fault. With his great reputation on the battlefield, Hudson was inevitably feared by others, especially the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he continues to show weakness in politics, it can only slightly alleviate the anxiety in Caesar IV's heart. The promotion of so many generals in the army is not a decoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a meritorious minister, he certainly cannot directly suppress Hudson, so he can only use subtle means to weaken his influence from the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, let's stop now! I don't have that much ambition. The current situation of the Koslow family is already very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the name of defending against orcs, a Near Eastern military group was created. What is the difference between that and the alliance of the five major families in the Northland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the five major families in the Northland are still imposing, their good days are coming to an end soon. After offending so many people, it was only a matter of time before the backlash broke out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current detached status is because apart from the five major families in the Northland, there are people promoted by him in the other major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To a certain extent, these people are able to influence the decisions of major forces. As long as there is no core conflict of interest, a good relationship can be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unknowingly, Hudson has built his own political \"mountain\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson jumped out to fight for political power, these military nobles labeled with the Hudson family would be the backbone of the faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to have a pan-political alliance, and then go to the Near East to form a military alliance, Caesar IV must be mad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The confrontation between the nobles and the king is nothing new in the continent of Aslante. The five major families of Peking University suffered a severe injury to the royal family back then, but they are still alive and well now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Being able to do it” does not mean you have to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family does not have enough background, even if a political alliance is formed, other families will benefit more from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One person attains the Tao, chickens and dogs ascend to heaven\" seems to be a good thing, but if the degree of it is not grasped properly, it will become a negative case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly pushing the incompetent clansmen to important positions will not withstand the corruption of interests, and things will definitely happen later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than being dragged into the water in the end, it is better not to let them set foot in the court from the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have ambitions, then go out and start your own business. He will not be jealous of how high you climb in the end, and you can only blame yourself if you die halfway. Anyway, Hudson will not push them into politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on his understanding of the family, there is currently no one in the family who is qualified to participate in the court game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I didn't say what happened today. Next, the Holliser family will keep a distance from the five Dukes of the Northland, and I won't embarrass you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran said slightly disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough leaders, the Baotuan plan has just begun, so it can only die prematurely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the five major families in the Northland, they are not familiar with each other. Being able to come together was due to the development needs of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to obtain supplies from the kingdom, you must pass by the territory of the five major families in the Northland. In order to pay less tolls, we can only establish a good relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship between those who pay tolls and those who collect tolls is naturally not that deep. The friendship of a familiar face is not worth worrying about them for Earl Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Approaching the capital, the joy of victory rushed towards everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the city of Canglan, Caesar IV, with his court officials, Chinese and military officials, greeted the triumphant team at the gate of the city early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Caesar IV has done a really good job in terms of prestige. No matter how much sincerity there is, this high-standard treatment alone makes all the military generals very satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the leader of the generals, Hudson did not let Maxim perform this time, but rode a horse in a regular manner and walked at the forefront of the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Approaching the gate of the city, Hudson waved his big hand and ordered: \"All soldiers dismount and enter the city on foot!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Face is given to each other, and the king came to greet him in person, so naturally he couldn't continue to sit on the horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If only the ministers of the DPRK and China came to greet them, then there is a high probability that they would say hello and lead the team over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a set of cumbersome triumphal ceremonies, Hudson only felt tired after he had to continue to courteously test with Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone has practiced. Even wearing armor, they can walk more than ten miles to the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you have demonstrated the prestige of the kingdom in this battle. Looking at the entire continent, no one dares to underestimate my Alpha Kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has been established for hundreds of years, and this is the most beautiful win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only disabled the Ancient Remnants Alliance, deterred the elves, but also defeated the orc army without any external support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV's high-spirited boast made Hudson very embarrassed. Accept it, it's a little too much; if you give in, the generals behind will still watch!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his status, he can't be a sycophant. If you insist that this is the credit of the king's leadership, I am afraid that the nobles will laugh out loud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, these are the credits of all the soldiers, as well as the credits of all the citizens of the kingdom, as well as all the officials...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson still has to face, even though Caesar IV hinted very clearly, he still didn't follow his will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has contributed, and it would not be awkward to bring the king. But in this way, it is more like a modest courtesy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to achieve the goal, Caesar IV smiled, but his facial expression was very reluctant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the two walked at the front of the line, and the people behind could not see their expressions, otherwise it would be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The short episode did not affect the smooth progress of the triumphant ceremony, and everyone was immersed in the ocean of joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The material rationing system that was implemented for nearly two years is now abolished. The banquet, which is far away from everyone's life, will return to everyone's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This chapter complements yesterday's\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It would be difficult to solve the Near East issue when everyone returned to the territory without taking advantage of everyone to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Privately sent people to communicate with all parties. Unfortunately, all the nobles, including Hudson, have no love for the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles do not have the power to choose fiefdoms, but they have the power to refuse fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the fiefdoms that everyone is unwilling to accept will be directly ruled by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this terrible idea was proposed, it was met with collective opposition from the court officials, especially the officials from the Ministry of Finance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's direct jurisdiction is either a metropolis or a strategic location.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either it can generate financial revenue for the kingdom, or it can strengthen the control of the local area and ensure the implementation of government power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Near East region has nothing to do with these two points, and it is purely a burden to get it in your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of ruling a noble lord and the cost of directly governing a kingdom are far from the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immigration, city building, land reclamation, and defense lines all cost money. Letting bureaucrats dominate these tasks is a bottomless pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you grit your teeth and get through the early stage of investment, you have to spend money every year to defend against the invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles don't want it, the government doesn't want it, and the royal family doesn't want it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal hometown of the three provinces in northern Xinjiang is a heavy burden. From the recovery to the present, on average, hundreds of thousands of gold coins have been lost in administrative expenses every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Near East region, which has a larger area than the northern Xinjiang royal family, will only pay more, and it is still unlimited compensation that can't be seen at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the Minister of Finance, if the gold-swallowing beast in the Near East is taken over, the kingdom's finances will go bankrupt at least ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is uncertain how much exaggeration is involved. Anyway, Caesar IV was frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big nobles are not willing to jump into this pit, and the small nobles below can't fill this pit at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a big force taking the lead, no matter how many small and medium-sized nobles are thrown over, they will not be able to support the Near East defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Near East is surrounded by many rivers and lakes, with superior natural conditions, fertile land, and lush water and grass. The area is as high as more than 1.3 million square kilometers, comparable to the twelve provinces of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once developed, the kingdom's national strength can increase by at least 30%, and everyone can get rich returns from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs have been hit hard one after another, and they will be unable to look around in the next few years. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us, as long as everyone...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, tried his best to promote the benefits of the Near East, but unfortunately, everyone just didn't buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Near East region was preliminarily developed, and everyone gritted their teeth and saved money for more than ten or twenty years, and it was done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if you want to keep the Near East, whether you can devote all the power of the kingdom to it is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destruction is easy and construction is difficult. If the threat of orcs is not resolved, farming cannot be done with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destroying the orc empire is just a political slogan, shouting something that has not been completed for hundreds of years, who can guarantee that it will be resolved in their lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks like a loss-making business at first glance, so naturally no one is willing to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the development of the Near East is indeed of great significance, but we have suffered heavy losses in the war and are really unable to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Near East is the front line of the kingdom, and our provinces that are adjacent to the sphere of influence of the elves are also the front line now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is urgent to build the defense line in southern Xinjiang!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Near East, the kingdom will develop if it has the ability, and if it does not have the ability, it will start slowly. Building a line of defense with the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang as the border can save some money. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the Marquis Zuel also represent the position of the nobles of the border provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall situation is indeed important, but everyone should take care of themselves first. Under normal circumstances, the elves are unlikely to invade the kingdom, and that is not normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not propose to abandon the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang and directly use the original northern defense line, which is a responsible performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Zuel, you know how big the threat of the orcs is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't take the opportunity to occupy the Near East, maybe decades later, we will face another orc empire in its heyday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom wants to get rid of the strategic dilemma, we must move eastward, constantly compress the space for the orcs to move, and limit the recovery speed of the orcs in terms of resources. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez's words successfully drew everyone's attention back to the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The casualties on both sides of the previous orc invasions were in the millions, and the population of the elves simply couldn't bear the consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a conflict breaks out, it is still a local war. If an all-out war is launched, even if the elves win the war, they will lose the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the threat of orcs, the \"Elf Threat Theory\" is obviously less convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the elves are famous on the mainland for their magic. In front of the elf magician group, the ordinary defense line can't play much role at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to fight against them, the most effective way to fight is to fight in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it can cause certain casualties to the elf army, it doesn't matter if it fails. After a few more failures, the two sides will come to the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is not so easy to compress the living space of the orcs. Even the orc tribes are not something ordinary noble lords can deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To form an effective defense, the best way is to coordinate the military forces of the front-line provinces and coordinate the defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, the kingdom will also station heavy troops in the Near East, so that it can provide timely support to the noble lords in the border areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, there are only a handful of generals who are capable of coordinating the overall situation, I am afraid it is...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce's words put the matter on the bright side, almost directly calling Hudson's name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coordinate the armed forces of the nobles in the provinces, and command the standing army of the kingdom. Apart from him, there is no other candidate for this kind of work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the position is high and weighty, it does not mean it is a good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The border line is so long, there is not even the most basic line of defense, the enemy can break through at any time, it is completely impossible to defend against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well the coach can coordinate, accidents will inevitably happen frequently. It doesn't matter once or twice, if the enemy breaks through a hundred or eighty times, the coach must be scolded to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic lords whose interests have been damaged have no time to consider the overall situation, they will only think that the coach is incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this proposal was not made by Governor Pierce alone, but more like the result of a compromise between the various factions in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by too high prestige, and now all parties want to suppress Hudson's development. Conspiracies and tricks are not fun, so go directly to Yangmou.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's rapid rise, the Dalton family suffered the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't want to kick Hudson out, I'm afraid it won't be long before the first family of their province will change hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing the purpose of all parties, Hudson still drank his tea without changing his expression. He had already made up his mind, as long as he didn't mention his name, he would pretend to be confused to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, he can't hide from the giant pit in the Near East, but how to get there is still up for discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is work to be done, and it is not over by trapping people in the past. He must be willing to go there, so that everyone can rest assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability that the kingdom can gain a firm foothold in the Near East is not high. Choosing to rule the Near East is more about strategic needs. If the coach can't devote himself wholeheartedly, it will be even more hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the situation was on the verge of getting out of control, Foreign Minister Earl Francis stood up and said: \"The Near East issue is too involved, and it will be difficult to discuss the results in a short while. Let's discuss the international situation first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance has adjourned, and the Alien Alliance has also temporarily announced its adjournment. The two major alliances had no formal contact, so they unanimously chose to end the war, and the two sides took the actual control area as the boundary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire southern continent fell into the hands of the human race. The land occupied by the human race in the central continent has shrunk by nearly 40%, and the human-controlled area of ​​the northern continent has shrunk by three quarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the war, only the Principality of Moxie and the Kingdom of Hesse remained among the human nations adjacent to us, and the strategic space was greatly compressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this war, a total of 31 human nations were destroyed, and we have received five governments in exile, the most important of which are the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After many consultations, the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms have decided to merge, and we hope we can support their restoration! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northern Continent lost a lot of land. The most important thing was the destruction of the Seven Grassland Kingdoms and the loss of the vast orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One orc prairie is equivalent to three Alpha Kingdoms, which directly increased the number of territories lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of economic value and population, the Central Continent suffered the heaviest losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 15 countries in the Central Mainland that were destroyed had an official population of 60 million. The actual population could easily double, or even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the economic value, just looking at the financial revenue of the destruction of these countries, it is four times as much as the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important to know that the tax collection capabilities of the two parties are not the same. With the same economic size, the tax revenue that can be obtained under the Alpha Kingdom system can easily double.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the power of peace in the world. As long as there is no large-scale war and the lord does not extort excessively, the population growth rate will be very fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the small countries in the North Continent that were destroyed also had a large population. It's just that their situation is not as good as that of the countries in the middle mainland, and they have to send heavy troops to participate in the activities of resisting the invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current tragic fate is, in a sense, paying for their paddling in the last orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Warhammer Kingdom hadn't been crippled, and the losses of the Principality of Mosi and the Kingdom of Alpha had been a little smaller, the Alliance of Ancient Remnants would not have been able to form at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they weighed their strength on paper and found that the price to be paid to penetrate the Northern Continent was too high, so the elves gave up directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One careless move and the whole game is lost. It's too late to say anything now, and the governments-in-exile of various countries can only feel annoyed secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Warhammer wants to restore the country, so I don't think the kingdom should get involved. A verbal support is enough, but deep involvement with the kingdom can't afford so much money and food!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it also involves the allies of the Moxie. It is not worth paying such a high price for the Warhammers! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson took the opportunity to take up the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others only thought it was to ease the atmosphere, but only Caesar IV knew that this was the result of insider trading.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement between the Alpha Kingdom and the Elves, the territory of the Warhammer Kingdom was divided into two, and the current control area of ​​the Terrans is in the hands of the Mosi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    80% of the local resistance armed leaders have accepted the title of the Principality of Mosi, and the armed forces that still support the Warhammer Kingdom are at an absolute disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that these supporters are divided into two camps. In order to concentrate on the restoration of the country, the governments of the exiled Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms completed the merger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is still not enough. These limited supporters alone are not enough to support the restoration of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of the Moxi army, these armed forces did not even dare to recognize the legitimacy of the Warhammer government in exile, and still insisted on the banner of the East and West Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they want to use the restoration of the country as a bargaining chip to make a final bargain with the Moxi government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the conditions are negotiated, it is not impossible to make a fake show. After all, loyalty has a price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the continuous defection of neighbors, still insisting on restoring the country, but it is a dangerous job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to live up to now is only because the Moxi people pay attention to eating. Once the patience is exhausted and extraordinary measures are taken, the death of a few nobles is not a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the side of the Terran Alliance, the Warhammers have appealed countless times, but unfortunately the decision of the Alliance Council is not binding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one that can effectively intervene in the Warhammer Kingdom and let the Mossi hand over the control area is the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson is right, the kingdom is now powerless to intervene in the dispute between the Mossi and the Warhammers, so they should simply remain neutral!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rise of a powerful Principality of Moxi can share the pressure from the elves for us, which is also a good thing for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's getting late, let's get here first today. After attending the celebration banquet, we will discuss the Near East issue tomorrow. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is so logical, and the affairs of the Warhammer Kingdom seem to be created to ease the atmosphere. Before everyone participated in the discussion, the king made a decision directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to speak up to object, but don't know where to start. After all, supporting Warhammer's restoration of the country requires real money, and allowing the Moxie to expand does not have to pay any price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I vaguely sensed that something was wrong, but everyone couldn't tell what was wrong, so they could only attribute the problem to - a good relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson and the Mossi have a good relationship, which is well known. King Caesar IV and the Moxi royal family are even more in-laws, and it is normal to help relatives or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking out of the hall in twos and threes, everyone suddenly discovered that the Minister of Foreign Affairs only proposed to support the restoration of the Warhammer people, but did not mention the benefits that can be obtained by supporting the restoration of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are not relatives or reasons cannot be used in vain. Under normal circumstances, if the Warhammer government in exile wants to gain support, it must promise huge profits to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment of hesitation, everyone chose to remain silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how rich the benefits promised by the Warhammer people, they must be able to be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important things in restoring the country are land and population, and the Warhammer government in exile doesn't have any of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the resistance armed forces supporting them are counted, the population is only 1.8 million, and the specific control area is at most one or two provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the land and population belong to the Moxi people, and the least population belongs to the Moxi Principality. Unlike land that cannot be moved, people are allowed to move across borders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees who poured into the Principality of Moxi, as long as George grants them national status, they are legal Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the nobles who accepted George's canonization, they resisted to the end in the face of alien invasion, and only defected to their new owners after the fall of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the royal family and the government who ran away were the first to betray.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you interfere, you can't force the Morsi to pledge allegiance to the Warhammer Kingdom. If there is no bottom-line cross-border interference, there will be no friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the Duchy of Moxi is far more important than the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    quietly completed a cooperation, and Hudson's mood improved a lot. Enjoying the compliments from everyone at the banquet, the dispute that happened in the inner hall just now seemed to have never existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially a group of noble lords from the north, who kept coming over to get acquainted with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the old enemy, Duke Torsten, who is still not in a good mood, everyone is very kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The topic of discussion has also changed from the sensitive Near East issue to the issue of their respective military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big nobles are all in a good mood, but the faces of the small and medium nobles below are getting uglier than the other. Even on such a special occasion as a celebration banquet, everyone laughed very reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these people already knew that the Kingdom was going to conquer the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A meritorious minister is likely to be canonized to the Near East Front, and be neighbors with annoying orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles who have not made military exploits will not be happy. The money, food, and labor for developing the Near East will definitely be apportioned among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, relying solely on the ability of the local lord, who knows when the Near East line of defense will be repaired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky, you may be forcibly removed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually this is an extreme measure taken when no one is stationed in the border area and no one is willing to fill in the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the kingdom allocates quotas to the provinces, and then a group of noble lords draw lots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not no ways to deal with it. If there are noble children who take the initiative to take on heavy responsibilities, then everyone only needs to get together the number of immigrants and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific method of filling the hole depends on the results of the game between the parties, but this does not affect everyone's first visit to the temple gate of Hudson to burn incense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not going to the Near East can be regarded as making money. If unfortunately you join the Near East Development Corps, this relationship may save your life at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone came to show their favor, and Hudson would not refuse anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the future uncertain, the big nobles in the kingdom are unwilling to invest too much power in the Near East. To develop the Near East, they can only rely on the small and medium nobles who have no right to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After trying to let him break the marriage was rejected, the two parties have no contact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the war is over, the urgency to marry is gone. According to the common practice in the continent of Aslante, there are no special circumstances, and the marriages that the parties strongly oppose will be canceled in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the purpose of marriage is to deepen the relationship between the two countries, not to make enemies. Forcing a marriage, the bedside wind is not disrupting the relationship between the two countries every day!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the maid into the back garden, I saw Princess Madeleine, but there were Caesar IV and the queen beside her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it was not Princess Madeleine who invited him here today, but Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A glance from Caesar IV suggested that the maids left one after another, leaving only four of them in the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marshal, the main purpose of inviting you here in the name of Madeleine is to deceive others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened just now, although we cooperated well, still attracted the attention of those who cared. In order not to cause complications, she could only let Wang Mei play a cover. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV immediately explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, his every move has attracted countless attention. That's all in normal times, but this time the interests involved are too great, so he can't help but ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Near East, which is always facing the threat of orcs, the land of the Warhammer Kingdom is not only a well-developed land, but also has a much higher safety factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Alliance of the Remnants of the Ancients\", that is just the kingdom's defeat. An expeditionary army can **** them, who would regard them as a threat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to stir up trouble, the royal family is not easy to provoke, not to mention the ally of the Principality of Moxi to share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is right to be cautious. The more critical this moment is, the more we cannot take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Moxi people also need to urge them. Now that some things have been resolved, they must be implemented quickly, and accidents are prone to occur if it is delayed for a long time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson responded with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is false to urge the Mosi people to speed up their progress and annex the Warhammer Kingdom. The real purpose is to let them fulfill their promises quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he really envied Caesar IV. The family background left by the ancestors is solid, but it is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal collar in the northern border is close to the Warhammer Kingdom, and the cakes allocated can support the merger into the royal collar, which happens to be one piece.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, the royal family is planning an action against the five Dukes of the North. In addition to the past hatred, the main thing is that they are in the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the three northern provinces were the largest territory of the royal family. After merging the land from the Warhammer Kingdom, the area will be even larger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It needs a lot of resource investment in a short period of time, but its future development potential is far better than that of the royal leaders currently controlled by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal family scattered in the provinces is nothing more than that, but including the two provinces where the royal capital is located, it is the current foundation of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One is \"now\" and the other is \"future\". Both are areas that the royal family cannot abandon and need to focus on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is naturally to connect the two largest royal families together, thus forming a closed loop strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategic conflicts are superimposed with old hatreds, and the alliance of the five major families in the Northland in the middle seems to be an eyesore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is so mysterious. When he first succeeded to the throne, Caesar IV made great efforts to win over the five Dukes of the Northland, and he hated Hudson so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just a blink of an eye, Hudson became the best partner of the royal family. On the contrary, the five major families of the Northland who were much co-opted became the target of Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unrealistic to uproot the five major families. It is still possible to uproot the most eye-catching one of them piecemeal, and connect the two royal family collars together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the royal family does not need direct control, as long as the masters who control these areas change from big nobles to small and medium nobles, the strategic goal will be achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fuse that led to the change of Caesar IV's political stance was the \"transit tax\" of the five major families in the Northland. The royal caravan had to pay protection fees when they passed by, which touched his sensitive nerves all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the old guys in the royal family, they instilled in Caesar IV's ears every day: the five major families in the Northland are damned, so it is not surprising that their political positions have changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of family interests, personal emotional preferences are nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who also had grievances with the five major families of the Northland, naturally became a high-quality cooperation partner. Adding the \"feeling\" of sharing the spoils together, it is not surprising that the relationship between the two parties has reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, please rest assured, brother Wang has already accelerated, and will soon form substantial control over the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, you can get one-seventh of the income from it, which is nearly one-fourteenth of the territory of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different territories have different values ​​and need to be evaluated comprehensively. This income is definitely more than the royal territory in the southeastern province, and you can also get compensation from other places. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The queen's words made Princess Madeleine envious. This is one-fourteenth of the Warhammer Kingdom, even if it is a ruined Warhammer Kingdom, it is also worth a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a big piece of cake was just let out, and my brother Wang didn't object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the royal family will restrict the development of the domestic nobles, so as to avoid the tragedy of the princes becoming bigger and the royal power falling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially young nobles like Hudson, who are particularly capable of fighting, are the focus of suppression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Koslow family's background is not deep, and now it is completely dragged forward by Hudson, and its own talent pool can only support a middle-class noble family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family, whose foundation is not stable, is actually a castle in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, at the beginning, the Principality of Moxi only wanted to tear off two or three provinces from the Warhammer Kingdom. No one thought that under Hudson's manipulation, they would finally get half of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson itself has enough weight, coupled with the constraints of the magic contract, the cost of breaching the contract is ridiculously high, so naturally it can only fulfill the promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the royal family got more cakes. After digesting the results, the strength of the Koslow family will grow rapidly, but the strength of the royal family will grow even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Princess Madeleine, who doesn't know the inside story, only thinks that her brother and sister-in-law are really generous, and they can give such a big benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Queen, don't worry about compensation, it's important to finish the business first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Annexing half of the Warhammer Kingdom is just the beginning, the key is how to gain a foothold in the future. The alliance of the ancient survivors itself is not terrible, the key is that the elves behind it are difficult to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have sorted out a set of materials to deal with the threat of the elves. Maybe I will use it later, and I will trouble the queen to pass it to His Majesty George. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Respect is mutual. Although there are contractual constraints, the benefits that should be obtained are indispensable after all, but the specific time of handover can be flexible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other party gave face, and Hudson didn't mind making things beautiful. If there is prevarication, this information will not appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that the queen in front of him was not simple. Under normal circumstances, these matters are discussed by Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robbing the king's job has not aroused Caesar IV's dissatisfaction, which requires means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you look at it, Caesar IV is not a soft persimmon, and it is not easy to hold him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't figure out whether it was the love between husband and wife, or the queen's increased voice. The only thing that was certain was that the queen was about to emerge politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, the interests transferred from the Principality of Moxi to Hudson and the royal family will be attached to the Queen's name in the name of dowry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a legal point of view, the current queen and king have become strategic partners, and they are still inseparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three-fourteenths of the Warhammer Kingdom, even if one is to be given to Hudson, there is still one-seventh of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After swallowing this cake, the royal family's direct jurisdiction will expand from the current six provinces to ten provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this number is fictitious. Among the ten provinces that have been really developed, only three provinces have been operated by the royal family for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the royal family, in order to develop these seven provinces, it is imperative to build a defense line in the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a bout of unnutritious business bragging, Caesar IV suddenly got up and opened a map of the Northern Continent, and said in a serious tone: \"Marshal Hudson, here are all my own people, so I won't hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the compensation that the royal family can provide, except for the royal territory in the southeastern province agreed in advance, the rest is in the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can discuss what we like. However, considering the political influence, it must be a \"land transaction\" when publicizing to the outside world. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to publicize to the outside world is not important at all. No matter how much the transaction amount is, he doesn't need to write a big word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the royal family in the southeast province covers an area of ​​only 4,000 square kilometers, equivalent to a small county, with a population of only 400,000 to 500,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the perfect development, it is equivalent to half a deserted province in terms of value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, Hudson can also get a large province from the royal family, or a semi-ordinary province as compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the royal family's territory in northern Xinjiang was also harmed by orcs, so the value of direct exchange is not much different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to the problem is that the three provinces of the royal family in northern Xinjiang are all concentrated in the inland area, and none of them are what Hudson wants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV seemed generous, but in fact he wanted to find a gatekeeper for his own territory to avoid constant threats from orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the direct division of so many territories from the royal family has caused too much impact. Even if it is in the name of trading, it will still be noticed by the nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it is better to make appropriate compensation from other aspects!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All parties in the kingdom have the same position, and they all want me to go to the Near East to preside over the overall situation to ensure the safety of the northern Xinjiang region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering such a big loss, there should be some compensation, right? The size of the fief is a bit large, and everyone can accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Near Xueyue Lake, I want this area. In addition, the kingdom must contribute to open up a large port for me, forge seven fortress cities, plus thirty subsidiary fortresses, and connect them with city walls to form a basic line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The required expenditure input can be paid by the kingdom or by the royal family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson calmly drew a circle on the map, including the land from Xueyue Lake to the seaside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculated purely by area, it is equivalent to one-third of the Near East region, far exceeding the normal encapsulation specifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also lakes and rivers running through the territory. The water source is abundant and the land is fertile, which is very suitable for agricultural production. It can be said that it is the best land in the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only land, but also supporting infrastructure. Under normal circumstances, if anyone dared to make such a request, Caesar IV would definitely let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is obviously different. Hudson's appetite is big enough, but the royal family is also a beneficiary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to take away a province and a half from his own territory, but now he only needs to ask the orcs for land, and earn money with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Infrastructure investment is also paid by the kingdom. The royal family is nothing more than leading a little more, and the overall expenses are still controllable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, the Near East will be divided into ten provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson alone can take away the fiefdoms of several counties, add the land bond to convert one county, and consider the compensation premium for the development of the Near East, it is also reasonable to win the fiefdom of a province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are all border areas, the Near East is obviously more dangerous than Northern Xinjiang. For one and a half provinces in northern Xinjiang, it is reasonable to exchange them for two provinces in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From 30% to 1/3%, Hudson just took a few more points of land, plus a bunch of infrastructure, which is not worth mentioning compared to the increased income of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After weighing the pros and cons, Caesar IV looked at Hudson differently. What kind of power minister is this? He is clearly a loyal minister of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did get more, but the royal family got more benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Swallowing the six provinces of the Warhammer Kingdom in one gulp, the royal family's control area is directly doubled, and what is paid is only a piece of royal family territory in the southeastern province, and a part of political resources from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Hudson takes root in the Near East, the security of the royal family's territory in northern Xinjiang is also guaranteed, and they can freely invest in development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Marshal, you are straightforward. The fief issue will be handled as you say. However, the infrastructure construction in the later stage will take some time to promote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has just ended, and no one is rich. The resources that the Kingdom can invest in the short term are limited, but within five years at the latest, the construction of corresponding projects will definitely be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom doesn't have enough resources, the royal family will try to make up for it. The specific detailed plan will be discussed after the site selection is completed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who stayed in southern Xinjiang, was the key defense target of the \"power minister\". Went to the Hudson where the Near East developed, that was the pillar of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Historical experience told Caesar IV that with the good territory of orcs living there, even if the Koslow family really grew bigger, it would be consumed by orc invasions again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the big threat of the Koslow family, he is more worried that the Koslow family's lack of background will drag Hudson back and fail to gain a firm foothold in the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it might be hard to account for such a large fief in one go, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, in the history of the kingdom, no one has been able to obtain the fiefdom of a province at one time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Near East region has not yet set up a province, so there is more space for maneuvering, but if such a large piece of land is acquired at one time, the domestic nobles are afraid that they will make trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to make a promise, but another to implement it. Caesar IV is not Caesar III after all, and he can't make a promise in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the operation is not good and a large number of nobles resist, the canonization plan may be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, bad things are easier than good things. Even when self-interest is not involved, jealousy can make people lose themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Marshal, they don't want the land in the Near East. If anyone dares to jump out and make trouble, I will transfer him to the Near East!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of everyone's rejection, he was furious. If all the great nobles in the kingdom were united, developing the Near East would not be a problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the uncertainty in the Near East is too high, and everyone has no love for enclaves that may fall at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the kingdom are unwilling to accept it, and the government is also unwilling to accept it. Naturally, the king can only find a way to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if there are no great nobles in the past, then it is best not to set up a province in the Near East for the time being, and first set up a Protectorate for unified management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the development has reached a certain level and a firm foothold can be established, the Capital Protectorate will be abolished and replaced by provincial rule. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that only Hudson can do it in such an upright manner. The truth is not that he is greedy, it is entirely for the sake of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are big nobles who are willing to spend their money to develop in the Near East, there is nothing wrong with directly adopting provincial rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these old guys are too sensible and don't want to waste family resources in the uncertain Near East. Just relying on a group of small and medium-sized nobles simply cannot support the defense of the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just look at the seven provinces of northern Xinjiang. None of the veteran middle-ranking nobles with the strongest strength in the kingdom could support the defense of the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it alone, you can only cooperate. It was originally planned that Hudson was only in charge of the military defense of the provinces in the Near East and northern Xinjiang. Once the Protectorate was established, it would be the military and political power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the issue of setting up the Protectorate's Mansion is too involved, we must first seek the opinions of all parties, let's wait until the next meeting to discuss it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, reason still prevailed, and he was not dazzled by the immediate interests. The establishment of the Protectorate is indeed conducive to strengthening the control of the Near East, and it will also lead to the enlargement of the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom now has a total of thirty-two provinces, and the Protectorate, which is composed of the Near East, is directly equivalent to ten provinces. The size of this giant is really too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the royal family can get six provinces from the Warhammer Kingdom, the actual control area is equivalent to twelve provinces, which is almost the same as the Near East in terms of territorial area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King's vigilance, Hudson just smiled. The birth of the Near East Protectorate is only a matter of time, and he doesn't need to be involved too much. As long as there is a little wind, the unlucky nobles who are going to the Near East will spontaneously promote it.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If the king contacts the marshal in private, everyone should think carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson, shouldn't you ask me to dance?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Princess Madeleine said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene of distributing the loot just now directly refreshed her cognition. Fortunately, he was born in the royal family, and he has cultivated the ability to stay calm since he was a child.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in my heart, there was still a faint regret. If she had known that Hudson, a potential stock, could soar so fast, she would have jumped at it the first time they met.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Baron Hudson cannot be the marriage partner of the royal family. But as long as she makes a move in advance, Hudson's marriage can be delayed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Royal marriage will not accept grassroots nobles, but it does not mean that it will not accept a marshal who controls the kingdom's army. Now Hudson already has the value of being wooed by the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For princesses who are destined to marry, the treatment of staying in the country is much better than marrying abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no if in reality, if you miss it, you miss it. There's no point in thinking about it other than sulking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a little embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, he really can't dance. No matter how good Hudson is, his native family is just a baron, with only a handful of resources in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daily practice alone consumes a lot of resources. How can there be resources to invite professional dance teachers to learn dancing, which seems meaningless to the low-level nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this case, it will not and must be done. It's also dancing, and other nobles will be laughed at if they can't keep up with the rhythm. With Hudson's current status, that is the embodiment of personality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident. On the stage, Hudson showed a very individual character. He had intimate contact with Princess Madeleine several times. Those who didn't know it thought they were flirting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no collision with the people around, because everyone was very winking and made a space spontaneously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, please pay attention to the occasion!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Princess Madeleine lowered her voice to remind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson's face turned green, and he couldn't wash it off even if he jumped into the Canglan River.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He hadn't studied systematically before, but Princess Madeleine wanted to play difficult games to show her elegance, and it turned out that he was taking advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Princess Madeleine was not really angry, otherwise the title of apprentice would fall on him today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, let's go down and have a drink!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hastily proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't continue to toss on the stage, otherwise tomorrow this romantic affair will spread throughout the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be a good thing for Princess Madeleine who does not want to marry, but Hudson is miserable, and an explanation must be given to the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the envious eyes of everyone, the two walked off the stage. It's just that what these people don't know is that Hudson is also envious of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to Princess Madeleine, who can only be seen but not touched, they have the chance to have a real affair tonight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masters in the field of love all ran to chat with the widowed lady about life, only Xiaobai still revolved around the noble lady.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Frankish Kingdom, after the Continental War, Lutetia became more and more prosperous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the entire Southern Continent has become more prosperous. The hardships of the countries in the northern continent and the central continent have injected the source of development into the southern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the plunder of foreign armies, the nobles and businessmen in the north-central region who longed for peace directly brought their wealth accumulated for thousands of years, and moved their families to the southern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom, which took the initiative to recruit refugees, is undoubtedly the biggest beneficiary. In a short period of time, millions of immigrants were harvested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of these people provided a double boost of human and financial resources for the Frankish Kingdom to develop new territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The economy is prosperous, the living space is expanded, and opportunities are everywhere. For a while, the social conflicts in the Frankish Kingdom dropped to the lowest point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is developing for the better, the only thing that troubles the Frankish kingdom is the \"religious problem\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grasping the pulse of the times, the Frankish Kingdom, which has successfully won the biggest dividend of the continental war, has surpassed its competitors and reached the pinnacle of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this kind of leading advantage, along with the passage of time, continues to be widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dark corners, there are also ship after ship of \"human slaves\", transported from the Central and Northern Mainland, injecting \"fuel\" into the development of the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it was the slave traders who were supernatural, or whether there was a secret transaction between the First Kingdom of the Human Race and the Alien Alliance, no one could say for sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things without evidence are equivalent to non-existence. What's more, the purchase of slaves from foreign races is not just done by the Frankish Kingdom. The difference is that they are the first to act, and the scale of the transaction is also the largest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each takes the deal he needs, not to mention capitalizing on the enemy. The seeds of this deal were planted from the moment the elves-led alien coalition forces accepted the surrender of human soldiers instead of playing genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The humans in the control area are themselves a hidden danger to the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the circumstances that it is inconvenient to slaughter, it is undoubtedly the best choice to sell in exchange for the resources needed for one's own development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race destroyed thirty-one countries, seemingly at the hands of foreign races, but in fact, the remaining human race countries and foreign races shared their inheritance together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it was the two major alien races that were destroyed. They were really exterminated. It's not that the Franks and Iberians don't sell alien slaves, the main reason is that no one wants to buy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance of different races is just an alliance. If the same race is captured, it's okay to pay the ransom, and forget it for other races!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are not so holy, if you really want to redeem a group of orcs and ogres, wouldn't you have to divide a piece of land to raise them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, except for the arms dealer dwarves who still have good financial resources, the rest of the alien alliance is poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last dozen or so continental wars, the main reason why the human race was able to win more and lose less was not because of their military strength, but because of their logistical victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, in the early stage of the continental war, the alien alliance was dominant. As long as it dragged on for a year or two, the situation would be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how the alien alliance prepares, the resources that can be mobilized are only enough for them to support the early stage operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the omnivorous orcs, who don't even spare the corpses of their own people, will soon face logistical problems as long as they can't break through on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to being \"poor\", the uneven distribution of loot within the alien alliance and various interest entanglements also laid the foundation for the prosperity of the slave trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The balance of power is broken, which will definitely affect the political structure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along with the continuous growth of strength, the calls for a separate Holy See within the Frankish Kingdom have also become louder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the time has come. The poor performance of the Holy See in the Continental War has led to a decline in reputation. Now is the best time to attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Edward tried his best to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See was scolded bloodily in the Human Race Parliament, and was even considered by the outside world to be the party most responsible for the collapse of the situation in the Central Continent. Naturally, the pushers of various countries were behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom, the number one rebel, is the main force among them. I had already made preparations to set up another sect, and I was waiting for an excuse to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Edward, the performance of the Holy See in the Continental War is indeed not good, but it is a bit far-fetched to say that they have colluded with alien alliances to sell the interests of the human race?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Preparation is back to preparation, and the banner of anti-Holy See is completely raised, and everyone still inevitably hesitates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the countries of the human race, the history of the Holy See can be traced back thousands of years ago. In the continent of Aslant, there is a law: ancient must be strong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this long history, the Holy See has not declined. Just relying on their deep foundation, every few hundred years, they will revive again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the enemies of the Holy See have disappeared into the long river of history over the long years. There are only a few records in the history books that can prove their existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, at this point, the evidence is no longer important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from Marquis Landry from the Kingdom of Alpha, they are also in action recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Archbishop of Tyrone even secretly formed: the Privy Council, the Inquisition, the Paladin...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the absence of the pope, the organizational structure is exactly the same as that of the Holy See of Dawn, and its ambition is obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we launch, they will follow. Once the Alpha Kingdom takes action, the Principality of Moxi will also be passively involved, and the churches in the entire northern continent will break away from the control of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three countries in mainland China are now angry with the Holy See, and they will definitely not be able to appease them for a while. Even if you don't follow us to set up another sect, you won't fully support the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is only necessary to persuade the Church of the Kingdom of Iberia to set up a separate sect, and the rule of the Holy See on the continent of Aslante will completely collapse! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Marquis Jesús said in high spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These changes are all due to their Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They provoked the conflict between the Three Kingdoms of the Central Mainland and the Holy See, and the actions of the Church of the Alpha Kingdom also had factors of their instigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Church of Libya, under their instigation, has the idea of ​​​​separating from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, who wants to be someone else's younger brother if he can become the boss by himself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of the Franks has no plans to unify the beliefs of the countries. The current action is only to break the monopoly of the Holy See and get rid of the control of religion over politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar political demands exist widely in mainland countries. In order to reduce the influence of the Holy See, the governments of various countries have tried their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, the Alpha Kingdom is so active, it seems that Caesar IV is not as weak and incompetent as the rumors say, and it is mostly nonsense to be ostracized!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prestige of the Holy See is too deep, and its influence spreads to every corner of the mainland. Coming out alone to fight against the Holy See, even for their number one kingdom on the mainland, the risk is still too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a few more allies working together, the situation will be different. Back then, when he first came to power, he dared to declare the pope illegal. Apart from his youthful vigor, he also had Caesar III to help share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Caesar IV came to power, the essence of the Alpha Kingdom's anti-Holy See has not changed, but the specific implementation has slowed down a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, since the alliance of the five major families in the North was suppressed, the forces of the various factions in the Alpha Kingdom have tended to be balanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When all parties are evenly matched, it is difficult to truly give birth to powerful ministers. However, the rumors that Caesar IV was evaded are not groundless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that Caesar IV loved military affairs before he succeeded to the throne, and he personally led an army to expedition to the Principality of Moxi, but the defeat was really terrible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the incident, Caesar IV still did not repent, and repeatedly pointed out the country with his poor military skills, forcing the top leaders of the Alpha Kingdom to unify their position and not let him intervene in military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But fortune and misfortune depend on each other. It was his fiasco that laid the foundation for Hudson's rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alfa Kingdom was able to attack the Orc Empire in the north and defeat the Alliance of Ancient Remnants in the west to deter the elves despite heavy losses. The command ability of Hudson, the number one general in the Northern Continent, is also an important factor! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, Duke Bergson, said with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These homework are all done by him recently. Previously, I thought that the Alpha Kingdom had entered a period of decline, and the level of attention had dropped to the third level, but I didn't expect it to be resurrected with full blood in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the overall national strength is not as good as it was at its peak, but its record is no worse than it was at its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is nothing surprising. The resilience of the Alpha Kingdom is recognized on the mainland. This unlucky kingdom has been hovering on the edge of life and death since its birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop, get ready, pick a good day, the Church of the Kingdom will officially separate from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should do a good job in coordinating the work, and it is best to be able to get the Alpha Church to act together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the three countries in mainland China are busy cleaning up their own mess, even if they hate the Holy See in their hearts, they dare not do anything at this time, let them remain neutral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Iberia doesn't have to hope, they have always wanted to take the kingdom instead. We want to rebel against the Holy See, they are the great loyal ministers of the Holy See! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the last three words \"Great Loyal Minister\", which accentuated the tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is for profit. The conflict between the boss and the second child is usually difficult to reconcile. If the boss and the second child are neighbors, there is no need to talk about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the two big countries of Frank and Iberia are the first kingdom and the second kingdom of the mainland respectively, and they happen to be close neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the foreign race was strong, the two countries hugged each other to keep warm, and they were once the closest allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, with the successful reforms of the two countries one after another, after each embarked on the road to becoming a powerful country, the threat of alien races no longer exists, and the original allies have become current competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fight between the countries is fierce, but the relationship between the nobles of the two countries is close, and the marriages between many families can be traced back more than ten generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on this blood relationship as a bond, the two countries have fought back and forth in the past years, but no major war broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long this calm can last, no one can tell. Anyway, the reality is that the stronger the two countries are, the more irreconcilable the conflicts will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the day when the alien alliance disappears will be the time when the two countries will meet each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is more likely to play a wave of faction confrontation before internal fighting occurs, and force countries to end up in the same team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, the Seminar on Near East Issues kicked off again. Thanks to the finalized agreement with the king in advance, Hudson felt a wave of what it means to have someone in the court who is easy to be an official.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the support of a series of ministers of the royal family, many sensitive issues were under the mutual cover of everyone, and they were understated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The progress was smooth, a little faster than Hudson expected. Clearly, there is genuine love for the lands of the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although some people had doubts about Hudson's Donado, but let them go to keep company, one by one flinched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not that the major nobles do not participate in the Near East issue at all, but the resources that everyone is willing to invest are limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the participation was small, they won a lot of fiefdoms. Basically, they all started in one county, and some even took several counties in a row.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Part of it came from the exchange of land bonds, and part of it was rewards for military exploits. Although military exploits cannot be transferred in principle, special circumstances still exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, now, the major families gather and manage the fiefdoms obtained by the children of the clan due to military merits, and indirectly complete the transfer of military merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how to distribute the internal benefits after playing like this, everyone has customary rules, just follow the original rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the fief issue of generosity to others, the Near East defense line that needs to be invested with real money is the focus of disputes among all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan of the Ministry of Military Affairs is very reliable. Not only Hudson's territory, but the entire Near East is covered by the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, the kingdom needs to build at least 30 pass cities, hundreds of war fortresses, thousands of kilometers of city walls, and thousands of kilometers of battle lanes in order to connect the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a large-scale investment in infrastructure, one can imagine the pressure on a feudal kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the support of the major provinces in the north, the major provinces of the rest of the kingdom either have doubts or directly express their opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When things got to this point, the problem became embarrassing. The provinces that expressed their support for the construction were all poor ghosts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no money or food, and even the labor force can't contribute much. On the contrary, the provinces that clearly opposed it were the main force that provided people, money, and food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Governors, you are all soldiers, and you should know how difficult it is to bring a prairie into your rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't build a city wall, when the orcs invade, what can we use to resist?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, investing a lot of resources in the land of the Near East is indeed a loss-making business, but the account can't just be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, everyone, once the defense line in the Near East is stabilized, the twelve provinces of northern Xinjiang will be out of danger, and they will be converted from the front line to normal provinces, and they will be able to contribute a lot of money and taxes to the kingdom every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the time period is long enough, this income will definitely be able to cover the cost of building the Near East line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As our national power grows, the national power of the orcs is correspondingly weakened. With the ebb and flow, the kingdom's advantage over the orcs will become greater and greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the plan is successful, we can continue to copy it in the future, gradually advancing to the prairie, and slowly eroding the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed difficult for everyone now, but this difficulty can be overcome. As long as we cooperate with each other to build the Near East line of defense, we can actually spend no money at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lords in various places will provide food if they have food, and resources if they have resources. If it is inconvenient, they will provide labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, this war will last for two to three years, and the provinces that have not yet completed the corresponding tasks just took the opportunity to complete the tasks. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Archduke Effiero revealed his fortune with everyone calmly, causing representatives from all parties to look at each other in blank dismay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war ended ahead of schedule, and everyone was naturally not consumed to the point of exhaustion, but it is true that poverty is true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to silence the opponents, the Minister of Military Affairs directly sent the \"planned construction model\", or in other words, he was continuing the kingdom's wartime economic model.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The material resources and manpower needed to build the defense line were requisitioned by the kingdom free of charge in an apportionment model, and the cost naturally came down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that needs to be tested is the kingdom's organizational ability. However, the Alpha Kingdom has mobilized twice in the past five years, and the kingdom's organizational ability is at its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone is determined to do it, they will be able to build the Near East line of defense. The only problem is the time it takes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone was still silent, Caesar IV stood up slowly and walked among the officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You all have no hesitation, just think about your own calculations, don't forget the kingdom's current strategic situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why the southern border can be stable is because we have deterred the elves and let them know that they will have to pay a painful price for invading the kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this deterrence disappears, do you think elves really love peace, or do you think that the alien alliance is a harmless slime?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will be no problems with the defense line in the Near East, and there will be no problems with all the borders of the kingdom. If there is a loss in the Near East, all the borders of the kingdom will become war zones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the kingdom's current military strength, it is simply impossible to support multi-line operations, and it is still fighting against enemies stronger than us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fantasy to deal with the enemy on one front first, let's get rid of this unreliable idea as soon as possible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have decided that in the next five to ten years, the Kingdom will devote all its efforts to building a defense line in the Near East. The big deal is that there will be a few more years of hard life, and it's not like I haven't experienced it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, until the construction of the Near East Line is completed, the royal family will donate all annuities, and the palace expenses should be kept simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You also set an example for the nobles below, save as much as you can in normal times, and put an end to extravagance and waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think this is pointless!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't put all our efforts into building the Near East line of defense, how can the nobles below who have been entrusted to the Near East region develop with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the next orc invasion breaks out, and the defense line in the Near East is like paper and is smashed by the enemy, then everyone will die together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think the Alien Alliance would mind, destroying the last two human nations in the Northern Continent, thus forming a strategic pattern of confrontation between the north and the south with the human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden outburst of Caesar IV startled all the ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resolute side made them seem to have returned to the illusion of the era of Caesar III. It is completely two extremes from the previous king who was suppressed by his officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little startled, Hudson was the first to react. The reason why Caesar IV backed down on military issues earlier was that everyone did not support him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A king without the support of his ministers is a rubber stamp in itself. The current situation is obviously different, not only with the support of the provinces in northern Xinjiang, but also with the help of officials in the DPRK and China and the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a good opportunity, it would be a pity if you don't take the opportunity to build your prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Switched to Hudson to deal with it, but also to use the problem to take advantage of the opportunity to reshape the majesty of the kingship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right. It is imperative to build a defense line in the Near East. The Kingdom must not take this issue lightly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment of stunned effort, the governors of the northern Xinjiang provinces expressed their support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden reversal of the situation made all the southern governors doubt the plan to establish a province in the Near East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces of northern Xinjiang, the royal family, and the court can be combined to dominate the government. If more representatives come out, it will be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
