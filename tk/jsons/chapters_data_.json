It is suspected to be the coalition of nobles in the southeastern province. It is currently being hunted down by the orc army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, the air became heavy. They all stared at Hudson as if there was something in his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter which army it is, send someone to inform them first, and let them stand still and wait for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was sent down, and after resting in place for two hours, the army pulled out of camp and set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all go down and prepare, don't delay the rescue time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's mouths became O-shaped, and they swallowed the words when they reached their mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the subordinates left, but brothers Nelson and Evora stayed. Obviously, they were also full of doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are no outsiders here now, so if you want to ask anything, just ask! There is no need to hide it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received Hudson's signal, Evola, who was impatient at first, couldn't help asking immediately: \"Hudson, are we really going to rescue them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One lion group cannot hold two lion kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is destined to have only one boss. As latecomers, the Koslow family either chose to leave and start another business, or challenge the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the difficulty of starting a new business, the mature southeastern province is obviously more attractive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply considering the economic situation, the southeast province can surpass the sum of three or four provinces in the north, and this is still based on the development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current strength of the Koslow family, they simply do not have the ability to develop a northern province. All branches invested at all costs, and Dingtian also developed a county in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are better choices, only fools choose to come to the north for development. With the same cost input, Hudson might as well use it to develop the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years, taking back the ancestral land has long become a slogan to unite the family's centripetal force. Except for the older generation, the younger generation hardly liked the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the opportunity has come, as long as they don't save themselves and sit back and watch the Dalton family have an accident, the Koslow family can take advantage of the trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the province, that can only be regarded as their bad luck. What's more, as a new political faction, Hudson also needs a place to house his younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to take advantage of the opportunity to kill people with a knife and cleanse the interior of the southeastern province is simply perfect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nonsense, I have given orders, can I go back on my word?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of unnutritious words can be asked. He very much doubts whether Evora's brain is not fully developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, he wonders why there is such a big gap between the children born to the same parents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss, Nelson, is full of mind. Although limited by his childhood education and limited horizons, his overall ability is still good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I arrived at Evora, I went directly to the other extreme. He can move anything, but he can't use his brain. He is a proper reckless man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, such a good opportunity, if you miss it, if you want to meet again next time, then...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Nelson finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Opportunities and risks always exist together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decline of the Dalton family is indeed what I want to see, but it is definitely not now, let alone decline in this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not only our people in this army, but also people from many other forces, including people from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the watchful eyes of everyone, if I make excuses and refuse to send troops to rescue, what do you think will happen?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if the Dalton family is really finished, we will be able to swallow the benefits they left behind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop having such sweet dreams!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The background of the Koslow family, supporting a middle-class noble is already the limit. Now every step forward, we have to face obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more we come to this kind of time, the more cautious we have to be. Especially in the face of interests, we must abide by our duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What other great nobles can do does not mean that we can do it now. As a new member, before integrating into the circle and building your own network, the most important thing is your duty!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must not touch things that we shouldn't touch! If you touch it, it will be the end of our Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that since the establishment of the kingdom, there has not been a single big noble that has climbed up from a small noble all the way. The ups and downs among the great nobles all happened within the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think they would welcome us in? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the pie is big, the Koslow family has bad teeth. Wanting to swallow the southeast province in one bite is purely like a snake swallowing an elephant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the allied forces of the nobles in the southeast province were wiped out, the remaining strength in their lair would be enough to drag the Koslow family down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of \"power\" is not only military strength, but also political influence and personal connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to pay the price, you can easily bring in a bunch of reinforcements with the connections of veteran nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people can be domestic or foreign. The Alpha Kingdom's vitality has been seriously injured, but it does not mean that the nobles of all ethnic countries have suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big Macs like the Dalton family have not been limited to the Alpha Kingdom for a long time, and they also have a lot of connections in other countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship network is not strong enough, there is no way to carry out cross-border maritime trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't even dare to play casually without knowing the other people's hole cards. Even if it is done in secret, it has to be done in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he integrates into the circle of great nobles, Hudson must be a great and respected nobleman, and he must not leave any handles to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By Xueyue Lake, the coalition army of nobles from the southeastern provinces was still caught by the orc cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two sides has been shortened to less than ten miles. It can be said that the orcs can catch up with one charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, two human cavalry galloped towards the army from a distance. Before the person arrived, the voice had already passed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Army ahead, listen up: We are ordered by the Earl of Hudson to inform you to stand on the spot, and reinforcements will arrive soon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Earl Pierce didn't feel the slightest bit of relief, but instead looked disgusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry in the coalition army can't outrun the cavalry, \"stand still and wait for help\", it sounds like there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite is: both parties can trust each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What both parties lack the most is trust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who would foolishly save their enemies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is necessary to send troops to rescue, it will be all kinds of passive sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Front Army, Earl Pierce. Did the rescue army set off before you set off?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Earl Pierce reported himself, he asked a tentative question. The messenger, who didn't know what he said, replied honestly: \"The army is resting, and it will arrive in two hours.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, I set off after two hours of rest, and there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, people are not machines, and soldiers must be restored to their condition before the war. It's not an urgent moment, and it's not a problem to delay for a few hours by forming an array and standing still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back and tell Earl Hudson that we will wait for him here and let him speed up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a slight smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the unnatural corners of the mouth, making the smile full of irony. It's a pity that not two messengers can understand all of this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl, we will truthfully convey your meaning to Earl Hudson.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, the two of them rode away without the slightest hesitation. Bringing professionalism to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the two of them disappear into the sky, Earl Pierce glanced back at the noble officers behind him and said, \"You all heard the conversation just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements are still resting, and they will set off after another two hours of rest. Considering the distance between us, we can meet each other within three hours at the fastest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to shorten the meeting time, we can't just wait here. Send the order to let the army speed up and join the reinforcements as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it was converging, but if you look carefully, you will find that there is a \"slight\" deviation between the road chosen by Earl Pierce and the direction in which the orderly left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direction of this thing, starting with a \"little bit\" deviation, after a certain distance, it becomes a \"billion point\" deviation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that Pierce can't believe Hudson's promised rescue. The thing that pitted teammates on the battlefield happened not only once or twice in the Kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that they stand still and wait for help, in case Hudson plays some tricks and deliberately leads the army to go a little bit in the wrong direction, and fails to arrive at the scheduled location at the scheduled time, it is also reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is quite normal to get lost in an unfamiliar land. The most serious consequence is nothing more than dumping the blame on a certain leading soldier who \"died in battle\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson might lead the team off track, Earl Pierce decided to give him a positive. After proper analysis, he decisively chose a path that was most likely to be encountered in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how you look at Hudson, it is not pleasing to the eye. Before encountering other reinforcements from the kingdom, this team was still their life-saving straw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the orc army is brought to the frontier guards, Hudson can't help watching the excitement. As for the meeting of the two armies, Earl Pierce still rejected it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is an interest. Now Hudson is the commander-in-chief of the enemy, controlling all the kingdom's troops on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Northern Expeditionary Army does not belong to the border guards, as the front-line coach, Hudson can still forcibly order them to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be a head short of others is a big deal to laugh it off; to be a head short of Hudson is a serious political accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will directly affect the ranks of nobles in the southeastern provinces. Except for the die-hard supporters, everyone else will become hesitant to stand in line, instead of falling to the Dalton family unconditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just these minor troubles, Earl Pierce can still find a way to solve them. What worries him most is the safety issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too easy for the coach to wear small shoes for his subordinates. If the strength in his hand is not damaged, he can still not buy Hudson's account, and even openly sing the opposite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately not now. With only a few remnants of the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces, it is difficult to win much right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time flies, and two hours passed by. According to the previous agreement, the rescue army embarked on the journey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a coach who promises everything, Hudson will naturally abide by the agreement. The only difference is that the army did not gallop all the way on the horses, but struggled on the backs of the weak horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Save the stamina of the horse, which is what all cavalry units must face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if many warhorses in the army have the blood of monsters, their endurance and explosive power have been greatly improved, but more of them are ordinary warhorses that are lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens that the speed of the army is determined by these ordinary war horses that are holding back. It is natural to use rough horses to travel in the army, which has become the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is slow, that's okay. If you can send troops to rescue in time, you have fulfilled your obligation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, something is wrong! The aristocratic allied forces in the southeastern province are missing.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is very difficult to continuously monitor the team dozens of miles away when the air supremacy is lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every summons is paid for by the scouts with their lives. With a little carelessness, the man was killed by the eagle man in the sky before he reached the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, even the Knights of Warcraft dare not come out to make waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom has a limited number of masters stationed in the border guards, and all of them are well-known. Hudson has no ability to use them as soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the loss of the coalition forces of nobles in the southeast province was completely expected. This was bound to happen as long as Earl Pierce did not stand still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the time, the interval between the notification and the present is only three or four hours. Even if he fled, he would only travel thirty or forty miles at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone is sent to look for it now, they can be found very quickly. Instead of sending someone out to look for it immediately, he asked his subordinates if they were leading the wrong way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Hudson's desire to rescue the coalition forces of nobles in the southeastern provinces is not as strong as it seems on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, we can be sure that this is here! You can see the footprints by the lake, which can prove that a large army has just stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know why, we clearly notified them to stand on the spot and wait for help, but now they suddenly disappeared. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scouting captain leading the way hastily explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grievances and grievances between the great nobles, many members of the noble group can't figure it out, let alone them small soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking through the history books, you will know how many times in history the entire army was destroyed because of standing still and waiting for reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcement, whether that thing is reliable or not depends on whose hands it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be too idealistic to expect the enemy to come with reinforcements and be able to rescue them in time. According to normal thinking, there is nothing wrong with Earl Pierce's approach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, reality is always full of surprises. Hudson led the team and arrived at the scheduled location as agreed, but the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern province were no longer in position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After checking the footprints by the lake symbolically, Hudson waved his hand and said, \"Okay, you have worked hard all this way, go down and rest first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send the order down, and the whole army will set up camp on the spot, and continue to act after the situation is ascertained. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a standard command, nothing new. Rescue, you have to find the target first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the actions of the army must be huge. If you follow the footprints left, there is a high probability that you will be able to catch up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that is only in theory, the soldiers were exhausted after marching all the way. If you want to preserve your combat effectiveness, you must rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces went off by themselves. This wave is not Hudson's resignation. Even if the news got out, everyone would only say they deserved it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the price of misjudgment, and the resulting consequences can only be borne by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bai ran a trip, Hudson didn't say anything, but the noble officers below couldn't bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of complaints are endless. The high-level nobles knew that this situation was a political game between the coaches, but the middle and lower nobles could not understand so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For all this, Hudson chose to pretend not to hear. Let's make a fuss, and it's better to make it known to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It hurts the reputation of a gentleman with the heart of a villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behemoths like the Dalton family, if you want to make them decline, the best way is to boil the frogs in warm water, rather than directly attacking the hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better for the officers below to have complaints. Only when there is resentment in their hearts, will everyone be passive and sabotage in searching for the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little slower in action, a little slower in reporting, today is almost over, and rescue becomes tomorrow's matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If other troops need to be rescued nearby, it might take longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rescue operation has been carried out so far, and Hudson has successively recruited more than 30,000 soldiers from the Northern Expeditionary Army, which cannot be regarded as a failure no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more and more troops in hand, and the speed of action is getting slower and slower. Under such circumstances, encountering the main force of the orcs would definitely not lead to any good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What surprised him was that not only did the orc army not come to him, but they deliberately avoided him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are certainly factors that intimidate his reputation, but it is more about the internal situation of the orc empire, which is more complicated than he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Avoiding and not fighting is not because of fear, but because the five royal families want to preserve their strength and are unwilling or dare not spend too much force on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy doesn't come, Hudson is also happy to see it. The mission that came out this time was \"rescue\", not a decisive battle with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is to fight a few beautiful battles, it is meaningless to him. On the contrary, it is more practical to rescue some nobles who have broken through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more \"life-saving grace\" ties, things will become easier if you want to make friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the rescue this time is the best opportunity for Hudson to establish a network of contacts in a short period of time and integrate into the circle of the kingdom's nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the army of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You said that the Beamon cavalry closest to the enemy's reinforcements are deliberately avoiding the enemy?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel asked in a cold tone. The dissipated cold air seemed to freeze the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Duke. The Beamon cavalry had to meet the enemy several times, and they all turned around at the last moment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the werewolf officer said, Duke Daniel waved his hand arrogantly: \"Okay, I know the matter!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tone of understatement cannot change his inner anxiety. The situation is becoming more and more unfavorable to the Orc Empire, and Duke Daniel has already sensed the danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the performance of allies made him feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We miscalculated the number of reinforcements under Hudson. We have limited troops, so it is not surprising to avoid the enemy's front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But up to now, everyone has gathered a lot of mobile forces in their hands, fully possessing the strength to fight the enemy. The Beamon family still chooses to avoid the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the wolf officers, Duke Daniel asked indifferently: \"How much do you think the empire will have to pay to defeat or wipe out this human reinforcements?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, it immediately caused an uproar among the wolves. Duke Daniel, who has always been arbitrary, would actually ask for their opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, they would rather not have such an honor. Everyone was even more panicked when they didn't even know what their God of War was thinking about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, referring to the past achievements of the Earl of Hudson, if he wants to annihilate them, he may have to sacrifice a full Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if the battle is under your command, this loss should be greatly reduced. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thomas' words immediately caused discomfort among the werewolf officers at the scene. When did the Behemoth Legion also become a unit of measurement?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't flatter, no matter who is in charge, if you want to eat the enemy, you will have to pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that the current Earl of Hudson's army is no longer the original 30,000 cavalry, but also the elite of the Alpha Kingdom who are constantly gathering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe when the war broke out, the enemy's strength exceeded 100,000. It is not easy to replace so many enemies with a Beamon cavalry regiment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrogance belongs to arrogance, but when facing the reality, Daniel has always been very sober.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same as the main force of the orcs, there are also grades. One Beamon cavalry regiment is equivalent to two silver moon wolf cavalry regiments, and their combat effectiveness is very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If used well, the power it can exert on the battlefield is even better than ten ordinary human cavalry legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a theoretical figure. If it was a head-on confrontation, the Beamon cavalry would still not be able to defeat the Ten Human Cavalry Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary Beamon cavalry may be able to fight ten against one, but there are still a large number of noble officers in the human cavalry legion, and these people's combat effectiveness is no weaker than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the guards around the nobles also have good combat power, and the combat power of individual soldiers is not weaker than that of ordinary men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, even Duke Daniel, who has always been decisive in killing, is full of hesitation when sending troops to annihilate the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to annihilate the enemy's rescue army, is it really worth sacrificing two of our main armies, or even more troops?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to ask Marquis Wusuhe and Prince Butzweig if they are interested in joining forces to make a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Completely wipe out the enemy's reinforcements, capture the enemy's defense line, bypass the enemy's fortress, and drive straight to destroy the Alpha Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, the werewolf officers behind him were terrified. The appetite of his own coach is not ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire plan is linked together, and any accident in any link may cause heavy losses to the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this gamble loses, the orc empire will really be over. Losing their highly mobile cavalry, they will be completely passive in the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, this plan involves too much, do you want to report it to the imperial court first?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thomas persuasively said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you afraid of? Wusuhe and Butzweig may not have the guts to agree to it. If it is reported to the imperial court, let alone pass it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has deteriorated to this point. If you still dare not gamble, the army of the Human Race Alliance will come next, and you will have no chance to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't you still think that in a step-by-step battle, we can fight against the human race? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, this war was wrong from the beginning. It doesn't matter if you go south on a small scale to grab something and come back. Invading the south and provoking the human race in an all-round way is the biggest failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the human race can become the \"overlord of the continent\" is due to the Southern and Northern Wars. It is not what the history books of the Orc Empire say - to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If cheap ones are so easy to pick up, and there are so many races on the mainland, why not pick them up and leave the opportunity to the races?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you really want to challenge the overlord, at least you have to bring in a few allies to do it together. What is it like to single out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As night fell, the orcs stopped their pursuit, and the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces also ushered in a short respite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the southern aristocrats who were the focus of the orc army, they have broken through all the way to the present. The army has dropped from the initial 80,000 to 70,000, 60,000, 50,000... to the current number of more than 5,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that in the morning, they still had more than 9,000 people. In just one day, the army lost more than 4,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many troops, not all of them were killed in battle, but they were scattered on the vast prairie, and they were still facing the enemy's pursuit, so they couldn't take them back!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an army of more than 5,000 people, there are more than 1,000 children of nobles alone. If he fights with the enemy a few more times, he might become an officer corps composed of pure nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the team is of course the best of the best. But if you want to expect them to do something, then don't fantasize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire army was physically and mentally exhausted. If it weren't for the fact that everyone had no choice, and it was even more dangerous to leave the main force, they might have already collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's face was very ugly. He had just received the news that the reinforcements led by Hudson arrived at the battlefield a few hours ago according to the previous agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of his order, the distance between the two sides was opened again, and the opportunity to join the reinforcements was missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he was clever enough to replace the soldiers in charge of investigation with his own, so the news was temporarily concealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the fire cannot be contained in the paper, and this \"good news\" will be known to the nobles in the coalition army sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that on the day when everyone's emotions exploded, how many criticisms and criticisms would come to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the province who have suffered heavy losses will most likely put this account on his head. In the dead of night, Earl Pierce still began to think about the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is impeccable in his work. Originally, he wanted to make a fuss about \"seeing death without saving him\", but now he has no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did this wave fail to calculate the enemy, but it placed itself in the position of a \"little man\" and properly lifted a rock and shot itself in the foot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this wave of tossing, the rise of the Koslow family after the war is almost a foregone conclusion. Thinking of a competitor appearing in his back garden, Earl Pierce scolded himself for being stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, they only wanted to suppress the nobles of the Northland, and did not give those guys a chance to gain a foothold, but ignored Hudson, a hidden dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Earl Pierce regretted it even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson is capable, this potential threat should not be restrained under the nose, and sent out to let others play freely, isn't it just asking for trouble?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the turmoil, it is now \"flying dragons in the sky\", and if you want to suppress it, it will not be as simple as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Racked his brains, and went through various countermeasures in Earl Pierce's mind, but he couldn't find a good solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The severely damaged Dalton family, although their comprehensive strength can still crush the emerging Koslow family, has lost its absolute military advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fist is not strong enough, and many strategies that may intensify conflicts cannot be used now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the challenged Koslow family, the defending Dalton family faced much more enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you fight with the Koslow family, you will lose both, and it will be easy for a third party to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can be relied on is the lack of background of the Koslow family. As a rising star, one must be cautious when he just joins the circle. When doing things, you have to stay on the line and strive for a good reputation for yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Earl Pierce scolded himself for being stupid. Such an important point was actually ignored by myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is nothing to be upset about. If this kind of thing happens again, he will probably do it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too irrational to bet on the integrity of the opponent at the risk of annihilating the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question now is: whether to join Hudson in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the other party dove, and then even if the other party dies, the public opinion will not be too harsh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is no longer under the control of Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing troops closer, not only lost face, but also offended a lot of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persevering is also not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without reinforcements, it is really difficult to get rid of the orcs' pursuit with only the remnant soldiers in his hands. If you are unlucky, there is even the danger of the entire army being wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's hard not to be surprised that they have arrived at the front line so quickly now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this \"fast\" is also relative. Hudson was still on his way to the Northland, and they had already set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dallyed all the way to Fort Augustus, and stopped again. It was not until the Northern Expeditionary Army decided to break out that they took action again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, they arrived at Bauhinia Pass at this time, and it can only be regarded as a normal marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Earl. This is a document given to you by the defenders of Bauhinia Pass, and a document sent by various forces from the rest of the Terran Alliance reinforcements.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving a thick stack of documents from the orderly, Hudson was so angry that he wanted to scold his mother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bureaucrats of the Terran Alliance Parliament did not appoint a military commander-in-chief, and all the reinforcements were carried out independently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he suddenly understood why the orc empire was so active and could still exist forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Human Race Alliance has been playing like this, it would be a ghost to be able to destroy the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more than a hundred large and small forces in the alliance, and the difficulty of coordinating internal relations alone is enough to suffocate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unified military commander, everyone plays their own way, and they can beat the orcs back, purely by strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in being angry, you still need to read the paperwork. These are all official documents, and each document represents a party's power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After briefly scanning the official documents that were similar to each other, Hudson's patience was exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the pile of documents in front of him, he knew that the next biggest task was not to fight, but to coordinate the various reinforcements of the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to reply to the letter in person. More than a hundred letters have to be written by him. It is estimated that he will not be able to sleep tonight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After driving such a long way, you guys should go down and rest first! Tom, call the noble officers above the viscount in the army to discuss the matter.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Discussion is nonsense, and they are needed to help write official documents and replies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of delicate work can only be done by middle and high-level nobles. If you hand it over to the younger brother below, without certain political experience, even replying to the letter can give back an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All parties sent official documents, although the overall meaning is similar, they are all routine greetings, and by the way, they put forward their respective ideas for the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to the specific details, each family has a different focus. Out of political mutual respect, targeted responses must be made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't seen each other yet, and the workload has increased so much, Hudson is also speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no need for reinforcements, and no use. It is the right way to fool people over first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the orcs have divided their forces, and they are no match for the coalition forces just because they left some cavalry to hunt down the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Beamon army camp, Prince Butzweig is enjoying the roast leg of lamb with a happy face. The spice dishes next to him seem to be telling his arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this southward invasion, there may not be much other gains, but the economic benefits, the orc empire still earns blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, they were either fighting or robbing, and they actually robbed a lot of good things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spices that were originally valuable, came to Prince Butzweig, and now they have become ordinary food on the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, this high-end product had to be paired with Warcraft meat. Ordinary cattle and sheep are not qualified to be put together with these spices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, Duke Daniel invites you to send troops together to wipe out the reinforcements of the Alpha Kingdom, take advantage of the opportunity to take down the enemy's defense line, and then drive straight to destroy the Alpha King...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the last word \"country\" was spoken, the leg of lamb in Prince Butzweig's hand had already fallen to the ground. Even the gaping mouth couldn't close for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information was so explosive that he drove straight to destroy the Alpha Kingdom, as if he had heard a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrating the power of the entire Beastman Empire, countless Beast Emperors fought for it all their lives, but none of them could achieve their goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With only this little force in their hands, and all of them are cavalry, even if they go all the way into the hinterland of the Alpha Kingdom, they can only look at the city wall and sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Prince Butzweig took out a handkerchief and wiped his mouth, and began to think.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel, he still knows better. If there is no special reason for this God of War of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan, he would never come up with such a fantasy plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminiscent of the current situation in the Orc Empire, he suddenly understood. It wasn't that Duke Daniel's mind was flooded, it was precisely because he was too sober.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to reverse the baldness of the Orc Empire, the best way, and the only way, is to create a shocking victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Victory on the battlefield can not only suppress domestic conflicts, but also stimulate all ethnic groups in the mainland who are watching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neither the Warhammer Kingdom nor the Principality of Moxie is enough. If you want to truly shock the heroes, you can only use the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that this is only theoretically possible. Everyone knows the strategic significance of destroying the Alpha Kingdom, but the problem is that he really can't see the hope of success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could this be the difference between a battlefield veteran and God of War?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to say something, Prince Butzweig noticed his counselor winking, and he understood it instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell the person here, just say that this matter is too involved, and I have no right to make decisions. I must first ask Queen Beamon to make a decision.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is feasible militarily is still unknown; but politically, he absolutely cannot get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wins the battle, he will attract even more fear than Meng Huang, and it is still unknown whether he will be able to escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose, let alone, being held accountable is a must. Being able to justifiably remove a hidden danger that threatened the throne, he didn't think that Emperor Beamon would show mercy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any country full of barbarism, the struggle for imperial power is very fierce. The rules of order are not applicable here, and only the weak and the strong can pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the dust has settled, but in fact the battle for the throne of the Beamon clan has not really come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the new Beast Emperor, Alex is limited by his previous personal reputation, so his reputation in the imperial court is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Prince Butzweig, there are several challengers, all of whom have the strength to threaten his throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no civil strife, because the current situation is too complicated, and no one dares to act rashly, causing an unpredictable crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not moving does not mean not being able to move. Alex wants to secure the throne, either to clean out his competitors, or to take advantage of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to factional struggles, Prince Butzweig can no longer say it himself. Even if he wanted to step down, the interest groups behind him would not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the lion camp, Marquis Wusuhe also received a similar message at almost the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to Prince Butzweig's excuse to procrastinate, Marquis Wusuhe's performance was much crisper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let someone come and tell Duke Daniel that the great strategic plan he proposed, let whoever wants to do it, don't bring me anyway!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Usuh said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel's strategic plan, he didn't understand it at all. Experience tells him that the best way to deal with a plan that he doesn't understand is to stay away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we can't go on like this! We must get closer to reinforcements, otherwise...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words were only half spoken, but Earl Pierce still felt the pressure. There was no other way, the news that he had painstakingly blocked spread among the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the decision made that day was dominated by Earl Pierce, it was also the common choice of everyone. Even if everyone is in a very unhappy mood, they are too embarrassed to criticize him as the boss on this issue, at most they will complain in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now it is different. Seeing that Hudson kept his promise and rescued everywhere without selfishness, everyone's feelings were complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are not smart, their losses will be greatly reduced. Especially those nobles whose relatives died in battle felt the most tormented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are always used to shirking responsibility, unwilling to admit their villainous heart, so they simply dumped the blame on Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, it is all because of the boss's blind command that the bitter fruit that appears now is brewing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of self-shirking responsibility deep in the heart caused everyone to have endless resentment against Earl Pierce. Now it has reached the threshold of the outbreak, and the team will fall apart if it is not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's meet up now! But Earl Hudson, please trouble Viscount Oran to send someone to coordinate.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he failed to withstand the pressure. Between the safety of the army and face, Earl Pierce chose the former.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it's still too late. There are only less than 3,000 people left in the team with us, and the number of noble children has also been greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to join the reinforcements, you have to face the hunting of the orc army. No one can tell how many people will be left in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are scattered soldiers in other places, under the continuous pursuit of the orcs, it is very difficult to think about the number of people who can be gathered at last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a heavy loss was a fatal blow to most nobles in the province. Including the Dalton family and the Holliser family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that apart from Earl Pierce, Viscount Oran has the most complicated heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like most of the mid-level nobles who had the opportunity to replace them, he originally wanted to cheat his teammates secretly to clear the obstacles on the road to revival for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't expect that without him taking action, everyone would suffer heavy losses together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the last moment, I had to ask my son-in-law for help. If Hudson implements the plan agreed by the two parties before, the Holliser family may be indifferent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no family affection in front of interests, and the world of nobles is realistic. Stabbing in the back is a daily operation, let alone just dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how complicated his heart was, Viscount Oran still agreed with his mouth. It's just that in the depths of my heart, it is inevitable to make a mark on Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just released someone else's pigeons, and now wants others to lend a helping hand, obviously embarrassing others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now let him come forward to coordinate, obviously to use the special relationship between him and Hudson to break this deadlock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in-laws are involved. If he didn't care, Hudson wouldn't be able to hang out in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocracy is a relationship society, no one wants to make friends with a guy who doesn't know his relatives. Even if it's just for the sake of looking good, you must lend a helping hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has nothing to lose, the only thing that is damaged is Viscount Oran's face. But facing the eager eyes of all the nobles in the province, he really couldn't say no.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you, the lord of the violent north wind, I owe more. Thank you readers for your support, and strive to return to the next chapter within the month, always love your Haiyue, okay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Without the help of allies, there is no need to even try with the strength of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he had time to continue his sadness, the emergency siren sounded in the camp, pulling Duke Daniel back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, something is wrong. The enemy's reinforcements... reinforcements are coming...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the scout finished speaking out of breath, Daniel's already cold face became even more chilling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you don't have to think about it so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 250,000 troops of the Terran Alliance + the 200,000 troops of the Principality of Moxi have arrived at Bauhinia Pass, and it is almost impossible to tear through the enemy's defenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he had the opportunity to bypass the line of defense, he didn't dare to do it. As a general, you can take risks, but you can't take the army out to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was the plan shattered, but there was not much time left for them to hunt down the Northern Expeditionary Army. In at most two days, the real elite of the human race will appear on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Velociraptor Legion of the Kingdom of Iberia, the Tyrannosaurus Rex Legion of the Frankish Kingdom, the Landrunner Legion of the Holy See, the Kingdom of Hesse...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the extraordinary military units that are famous on the mainland will appear on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon cavalry is number one in the world, and that is only for ordinary cavalry. Encountering these behemoth legions is also not enough to watch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is that the number of these extraordinary arms is limited, and the cost of raising monsters is high, and the most productive human race cannot be equipped on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the Alpha Kingdom used to have extraordinary troops, but it was finally destroyed under the continuous suppression of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha kings of all dynasties wanted to rebuild the extraordinary arms, but unfortunately they were limited by their own financial resources, so they had no choice but to give up in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is impossible. Since the establishment of the Alpha Kingdom, it has faced the threat of orcs, and the treasury has never been rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally accumulating some wealth, before he could do anything, the army of orcs came to kill him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing again and again, the Alpha Kingdom is either on the road to repaying debts, or on the road to borrowing debts, and has no spare energy to develop extraordinary arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the number is small, and it is relatively speaking. When the extraordinary arms of multiple families and powerful forces come together, the scale effect will be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire also had extraordinary units, but that was at its peak. In the process of being driven all the way from the center of the mainland to the borderlands, the extraordinary troops in their hands also suffered heavy casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ones left are just a few seeds. Limited by their own financial and material resources, they are no longer able to participate in this extravagant game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cavalry advantage is gone, and the air force advantage cannot be maintained either. Flying Dragon Cavalry, Pterosaur Cavalry...the familiar names made Duke Daniel frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order to let Yingren keep an eye on the movement of Zijing Pass. Once the enemy leaves the city, come and report immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify all troops to speed up the pursuit of the enemy. By the way, let them gather the team, cancel all military operations below the regiment, and move the troops as close as possible to the camp of the Chinese army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an order full of contradictions. It is obviously difficult for the \"wolves\" to speed up the pursuit of the Northern Expeditionary Army and gather the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the best fighter has been missed. If they continue to stay here, the offensive and defensive momentum will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before dividing the troops, he might still have thought about concentrating the superior force and eating up the human reinforcements. Unfortunately, the situation is obviously the opposite now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only part of the cavalry left by various tribes, and the reinforcements who wanted to eat the Alpha Kingdom had to join forces, not to mention the enemy added another 450,000 reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more reinforcements from the Terran Alliance, the Alpha Kingdom infantry corps guarding the city dared to leave the city at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all of them are added together, the total force is estimated to be able to exceed one million, and the overall strength is definitely no less than that of the previous Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Northern Expeditionary Army was not in a hurry to break through and the two teams teamed up to attack back and forth, the Orc Empire might have been defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After secretly rejoicing, Daniel's expression became serious again. Reason told him that the hidden dangers in the country must be resolved as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, let the race and the rebels collude together, and give them a cooperation from the inside to the outside, then it will really be the end of the calf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instigating dissension and division, but the usual tactics of the human race. Under the conspiracy of the human race, the major forces that split are not one or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rise of the human race, although there were races, everyone gathered under the banner of the Elven Queen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the rise of the human race, internal conflicts were soon aroused in the originally harmonious elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forest elves, prairie elves, night elves...all became independent, and finally formed a pattern of three elf kingdoms side by side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the elves quarreled, but they usually had a good time, and they exchanged a few words when they met, which was far less **** than the infighting in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elf empires full of centripetal force can split, let alone orc empires. It is purely a sieve that leaks air everywhere, and it will fall apart if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this were not the case, the five royal families would not often take advantage of the war of invasion to the south to carry out ethnic cleansing internally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the five royal families, the strength of all races is limited to an extremely low level, and there is no capital to make a fuss. This is the core reason why the orc empire has been able to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sunshine, grasslands, rippling lake water. In this picturesque land, the two armies finally joined forces in victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching a group of old acquaintances approaching, Hudson burst into enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't that he wanted to gloat, it was mainly that he couldn't help seeing his competitors in such a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My fellow countryman sees his fellow countryman, and his eyes are full of tears.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moist eyes of everyone, Hudson understood the nostalgia. I am really nostalgic, and what I am worried about is-what should I do after returning home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they set off from the southeast province, a total of hundreds of thousands of troops were assembled. When the army was completed, there were only more than a thousand people left. It was really too miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, there should be more than 3,000 people left. Along the way, Hudson continued one after another, and also gathered a lot of routs from the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, it is estimated that thousands of people will be picked up later. The classic negative teaching material of narrow escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were no previous mistakes in judgment, and the meeting with Hudson was completed two days in advance, the total strength of the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces might have exceeded 10,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first to be eliminated on the battlefield were the serf soldiers with poor physical strength and insufficient training. Those who could persist to the end were the elites of each family. It hurts to lose even one, let alone lose so many at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you have been traveling all the way, and you have never had a good rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The barracks have been prepared in the army, and all the supplies are in the tent. Let's go wash and rest first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a mockery. It can be seen from the dark circles under the eyes of everyone that they have suffered a lot these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that you are safe, a good night's sleep is a must. The caring Hudson will naturally not spoil the scenery by arranging any welcome banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, no matter which aristocratic coalition army he received, he never arranged a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the affairs at hand are too busy, and there is no time to make friends, let alone hold a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meet a big aristocrat with a familiar face, if you meet a small and medium aristocrat, maybe you won't even be able to see Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the army may lack everything now, but there will be no shortage of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of princes, marquises, and earls, and even the prince of the royal family, there are two in the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this kind of royal prince is famous and not worth much. In terms of the real power in his hands, it is not as good as a real earl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They appear in the army, the political significance is greater than the military significance. It is quite irritating to ordinary soldiers, but in the eyes of the great nobles, it is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A high title is only a noble status. The one who can truly represent the royal family and hold real power is Marshal Campbell who died in battle before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, after the end of this war, there is a high probability that Marshal Campbell will be posthumously named Grand Duke or Prince by Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson really admired Caesar III. At the beginning of his succession, he was almost ostracized by the great nobles in the country, but he reversed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister is a member of the royal family, the minister of military affairs is a member of the royal family, plus the dead military leader, Marshal Campbell, the royal family members alone account for one-third of the core key members of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A solid iron triangle controls these three core positions, and the court is basically under the control of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson felt that he seemed to be tossing a little too much. For superiors, loyalty is more important than ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not a direct descendant of a trusted confidant, and wanting to seek the position of the first person in the army, isn't he deliberately looking for it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Eastern monarchy is not here to centralize power. Otherwise, he, the taboo commander in the army, would have a high probability of being \"a dead dog\" after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is knowing, and the benefits should not be given up. The big deal is to resign and return to the fief as soon as the war is over, and not stay in the capital to be an eyesore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the routine operation of the great nobles. If you are not welcomed by the king, you will simply stay away from each other forever. Within the rules of the game, as long as you don't toss, there will be no failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the Northland are the best example. It is estimated that Caesar III wanted to get rid of them quickly, and the last thing he could do was to suppress them politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the few of them are still passive. They need the support of the kingdom to keep their own territory, and they must be mixed with domestic political activities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Southern lords like Hudson have very little dependence on the kingdom, so they don't need to get involved with the central government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, after making the decision not to enter the development of the central government, Hudson felt relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, long time no see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a simple greeting, Hudson saw Viscount Oran's unnaturalness. After just over a year, the positions of the two parties have been switched, which would be unnatural for normal people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be fine if it was just an honorary title. With the energy of the Holliser family, it is not bad for a false title. Even Caesar III was canonized, but was rejected by Viscount Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything comes from unspoken rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss of the southeast province, Pierce, has the title of earl. If the people below dare to surpass, do they still want to hang out in the southeast province?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking over the earl's title is equivalent to announcing to the public that he will be tied with Earl Pierce and will no longer mix with the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough benefits, no one would offend the boss to death just for a false name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson dared to take over the earl's position because he had enough military exploits and his military strength rapidly expanded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves tangible interests, even if it offends the Dalton family, it is worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what happened on the battlefield, and why are you in such a mess?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is his father-in-law, and he still has to give face. In order to cover up Viscount Oran's embarrassment, he decisively chose the method of changing the subject.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's hard to explain this matter. Although we were besieged by the enemy, we were able to hold our ground on the whole. Unless the enemy is willing to lose both sides, they will not be able to take us down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all those guys from the Northland, trying to break out of the siege. Everyone was bewitched by them, and after making a series of preparations, they launched a battle to break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We tore apart the enemy's blockade. But the days of being chased and killed by enemy cavalry were the beginning of the nightmare, and the army soon suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You already know what happened next. We could have met earlier, but that Pierce guy thought you would die, so he insisted on taking us away! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more Viscount Oran spoke, the angrier he became.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Part of this resentment was directed at the five major families in the Northland, and half was directed at Earl Pierce. After being tossed about by the two gangs, the revival of the Holliser family encountered another setback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this wave, not only the family's private army led by him suffered heavy losses, but even the forces in the kingdom's standing army were also severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With insufficient strength in his hands, he can't speak forcefully. Next, if you want to plot Fengyun Province, the difficulty has increased by more than one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the expected answer, Hudson wanted to laugh but didn't dare to. A group of southern nobles in the kingdom suffered heavy losses, but the situation of the five major families in the North was much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When meeting with Hudson, each family had at least six or seven thousand private troops in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that this is only the private army of their family, not the private army of a provincial noble like the southern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coupled with the fact that some of the rout troops can be gathered in the follow-up, it is estimated that the number of surviving private troops of the five major families in the Northland can easily exceed 10,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with these instigators, the southern Xinjiang nobles whose strength has been severely damaged have become a proper breed of injustice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the nobles in the southeast province, after stepping on the pit dug by the five major families, they jumped into another pit themselves, they are simply the kings of wronged species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They just don't know how the nobles from the southeast province who just came to meet them felt after hearing the \"good news\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to pass on the good news.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news\" must be shared with everyone. Originally, I wanted to call a group of high-level nobles to discuss matters, but now it seems unnecessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the orc army making trouble, this mission can basically be declared successfully completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if the losses are heavy, at least the core of many families in the kingdom is preserved, so that the political system will not completely collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike previous wars, this defeat was completely accidental. Being put together by the Human Race Alliance, the Alpha Kingdom could only pinch its nose to recognize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell is at most half of the person responsible, but he died on the battlefield, so it is impossible to talk about accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no responsibility for the defeat, so the nobles who suffered heavy losses are the heroes of the kingdom. There will definitely be preferential treatment for heroes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The jungle is prey to the jungle, but also has a tender side. At least superficial skills, we still have to do well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for those families that are directly extinct, they will be divided up immediately, and the remaining nobles will continue temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have a strong foundation, a strong network of contacts, and a strong successor, it will not be a problem to keep the family business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it will gradually decline. In the years to come, it will be slowly carved up by the voyeurs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most likely to be shuffled out is the minor nobles. The ability to resist risks is weak, and it is difficult to recover once the vitality is hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles are deeply rooted, even if they decline, it will be difficult to be uprooted for a while. As long as you don't risk your life, you can persist for many years by relying on your laurels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and Hudson's attention has increasingly turned to the post-war period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly took stock of the kingdom's family fortune, and Hudson also knew it in his heart. These troops on the front line accounted for at least 70% of the kingdom's military power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The majestic Northern Expeditionary Army managed to break out of the siege, but not one survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total number of troops to respond now is only 80,000 to 90,000. Even if a part of the rout can be gathered later, it will only be 30,000 to 20,000 at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These troops are considered the kingdom's first-class elite. The 30,000 cavalry led by Hudson, together with several regiments of the original expeditionary force, can be regarded as the elite of the second echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap between the two is mainly due to the higher proportion of practitioners among the surviving soldiers of the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, within a short period of time, the gap in combat power between the two has not been widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tens of thousands of elites in Hudson's hands are indeed slightly inferior in individual combat effectiveness, but they are winning battles all the way, and their morale is even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surviving soldiers of the Northern Expedition Army were all elites, but they had just suffered a big loss, and their morale was almost gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the more than 200,000 troops capable of fighting, there are hundreds of thousands of cannon fodder troops on the defense line, but the combat effectiveness is really pitifully low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there are the military forces left behind by each family. This part of the force cannot be fully counted, and can only be roughly estimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is tired, tired. In the next war, it's okay to fight with the Terran Alliance, but it's not enough to be the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing for people is to recognize their own position. Supporters naturally have to play as supporters, and then use themselves as the main force, then it will be brain-dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A battle report was quickly written in Hudson's pen. Once the ink is dry, it is quickly packed into bags and sealed, and the whole process is done in one go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his position, seek his own government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson wrote all the suggestions in the secret letter. As for the decision of the kingdom, it is beyond his control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp, Earl Pierce, who received the news of the orcs' retreat, spurted out a mouthful of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous misjudgment caused heavy losses and embarrassment to the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces. After finally making up their minds to save face and not come to meet up, the orcs retreated again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After every decision, it happened to be missed, and the whole world was against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Priest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Priest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Earl is injured!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The panicked shouts of the guards caused a lot of panic in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, there are dozens of earls in the entire camp, who can tell the difference without mentioning their names!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the panic, all kinds of rumors are flying around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gossip is always a human favorite, especially when it comes to the orc withdrawal. All of a sudden, the pressure of survival is gone, and everyone urgently needs a relaxing activity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor Earl Pierce, unfortunately became the \"protagonist\" of gossip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he woke up from the coma, he was injured, poisoned, assassinated, cursed...all kinds of possibilities were arranged by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pastor Debon, how is Governor Pierce's body? When will he wake up?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the hospital bed, Hudson asked pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his strength, it is too easy to distinguish whether he is really unconscious or just pretending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the compass to \"disguise the magician\", that is also a magician. Hudson also understands ordinary healing magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he, who has always been cautious, has never used it externally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the outside world, he is a talented knight with good strength. He became a magician by sharing the magic talent of the Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are misunderstood by others, let them continue to misunderstand you. The cautious Hudson will not blew himself up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, please rest assured, Your Excellency the Governor is just too tired and fell ill, and you will wake up after a short rest. It is not suitable for too many people to disturb you now, you see...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pastor Debon blushed slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lying is not a problem, but lying in front of all the bosses, he is still a little nervous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a certain big brother sees the problem and reveals the matter on the spot regardless, it will be a tragedy for him, the pastor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that he was simply thinking too much. There are not a few nobles who can see that Earl Pierce has woken up, but their emotional intelligence does not allow them to point out the problem so stupidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, let's take our leave first. For the safety of Governor Pierce, Pastor Debon, I will trouble you to worry about it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson took the lead out of the tent. It is enough to do this in acting. Pursue perfection too deliberately, but it is easier to leave flaws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is only an honorary earl, and his status in the army is not the highest, but he does have the greatest real power at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Marshal Campbell, the Kingdom has not appointed a new commander-in-chief. Hudson, the commander-in-chief before the enemy, is the most powerful person on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this power is empty. Everything stems from the appointment of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of an appointment, he was able to command the frontline army of the kingdom; it was also possible to lose all power in his hands because of the revocation of the appointment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slightly added a wave of trouble to Earl Pierce, Hudson shook his head secretly. Originally, the two families could live in harmony, but now they have come to opposite sides because of their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things often happen among nobles. Not to mention that the two families have nothing to do with each other, even if they are relatives and friends, there are not a few people who become enemies in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was an extra heavyweight \"patient\", and the army was forced to stay where it was. Anyway, the orc army ran away, and they didn't dare to chase after them, so Hudson was not in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they returned to the barracks, the two elder brothers hurried over. From their joyful expressions, it can be seen that the two of them are in a particularly comfortable mood now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, is Earl Pierce dying?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Evola's words, Hudson almost spit out a mouthful of water. What is it all about? He is obviously fine, how can he say that the other party is going to die?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where did you hear the rumor? He is still alive and well. Remember this kind of nonsense, and don't say it in the future!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded with a black face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rumors kill people. Earl Pierce was nothing more than a moment of anger and fainted in a hurry, so it was rumored that this was obviously done on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mastermind behind the scenes is not so easy to find out. The main reason is that there are too many people who can do this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former political enemies of the Dalton family; the nobles who hide in secret and want to replace the Dalton family; the nobles whose interests have been damaged in the southeastern province; even Hudson himself, are the main suspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The whole relationship is complicated like a mess. Hudson didn't have the time to help investigate this kind of thankless matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, sometimes rumors can become true!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson deliberately lowered his voice and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, no matter how he tried to conceal it, that excited expression still betrayed his current mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's son is still a teenager, and he can't support a big noble family at all. Once his leader dies, the Dalton family will immediately fall into a situation where there is no leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no guarantee that the Koslow family can be replaced, at least for a long time in the future, they will not be able to cause trouble for the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rumors can indeed become reality, but it is more likely to cause fire. As the patriarch of the Dalton family, you don't naively think that Pierce will lack protection experts, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Okay, these things, you should not mix them up. The conflict between us and the Dalton family should be slowly grinded away after the war is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't fantasize about snakes swallowing elephants, that will only support you to death. If you have this spare time, you might as well put away the materials of the extinct nobles in the southeast province first, it will be of great use in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too urgent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Successive victories have caused many people in the Koslow family to lose themselves, unable to give themselves a clear positioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very clear that the two of them have come to represent not only themselves, but also a large part of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two can become representatives because they are close enough to Hudson to say anything conveniently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of impetuous evil spirit must be suppressed. Hudson didn't want the family he led to degenerate before it had time to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson continued to add: \"Sometimes eyes and ears can also deceive people. What you see and hear are only what people want you to see and hear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has only one mortal enemy now, and that is the Locknard family that occupies our ancestral land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Dalton family, they can only be regarded as competitors with potential conflicts of interest, far from being immortal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must learn to distinguish between priorities. Don't rely on your own feelings to make enemies for nothing! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

You were crying and clamoring to break out, but now the result is what you want!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he still hasn't let go of the fact that the ministers united to force the palace last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king was in a fit of anger, so naturally no one went up to make trouble. At the moment, everyone is in a bad mood, and they want to throw the blame away, but they can't find the person who took the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell died in battle, and if he threw the blame, Caesar III would definitely not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the instigators, the five major families of the Northern Lands are well-established factions in the kingdom, and there is no lack of strength in the court. It is another endless wrangling for them to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Human Race Alliance involves too much and cannot be provoked. Let them take the blame, it will lead to international conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is the best bully, just reached out to help everyone, and at this time he threw the scapegoat away, and his eating looks too ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a decent person, you have to leave a bit of leeway when doing things, or you won't be able to see each other in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no scapegoat, then you can only scold the orcs. But this is the imperial meeting, so there's no need to be so rude, it's not too late to scold the following when you go back to publicize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the orcs have always been scheming, and they may come back at some point. Now that the task of receiving them has been completed, let the army withdraw quickly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Da Ai Fiero persuaded him publicly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which has suffered heavy losses, can no longer stand the toss. In any case, the remaining elite of these kingdoms must be preserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to previous wars, in this war, the Alpha Kingdom was passively attacked for the shortest time, the occupied land was the least, and civilian casualties and domestic economic losses were also the lowest in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the elite seeds are kept, the kingdom will be able to recover its strength in less than ten years. If production in the newly recovered provinces can be resumed, the national strength may even be further improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the losses are heavy now, the Alpha Kingdom is still the strongest among all the clan kingdoms in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Human Race Alliance can give some strength to destroy the Orc Empire, the Alpha Kingdom will not be threatened by foreign enemies in the next few decades, and can farm with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From an overall strategic point of view, the Alpha Kingdom was actually the winner in this heavy-loss war. It's just that the price paid was a bit heavy, and it looked like he was dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let them withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III nodded slightly and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are priorities and urgency can arise at any time, but military affairs must be dealt with immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do not bring emotions into decision-making, which is also an important factor for Caesar III to firmly control the government. Even if a pillar in the army was broken, it still did not affect his status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the reinforcements of the Terran Alliance have already set off, and they will enter our country one after another in a short time. Next, it is our turn to launch a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the geographical location, we continue to deploy defenses on the front line of Zijingguan and Helan Fort, which can no longer meet the needs of the next war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of the first batch of reinforcements from the alliance and the Principality of Moxi, now is the time to consider: re-establish a defense line in the newly recovered seven provinces of the Northland, hoard supplies, and prepare for the big counterattack! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, this was not in the plan. According to the previous concept, the Northern Expeditionary Army directly followed the group of \"lord knights\" tossing in the Orc Empire to bring the enemy down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that those old men's mentality is not very good. After learning that Emperor Bimeng died of the backlash of the secret method of longevity, their mentality collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the strong man from the Alpha Kingdom who remained in the army, everyone else went back to work on their own affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that dying people should not be messed with. Even if they knew that these people violated the contract and made the Northern Expedition Army miserable, the Kingdom could only swallow their grievances in their stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Went to the hinterland of the orc empire to make a fuss, but it was not completely ineffective. There were also millions of orcs slaughtered along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is to hit the five royal families in the hearts of the orcs, laying the foundation for the next civil strife in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, restoring the defense lines of the seven northern provinces will not be accomplished overnight. The manpower, financial and material resources required are all astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, you have to consider that the enemy will come and destroy at any time. If you don't pay attention, the construction site will become a battlefield. Destruction can be far faster than construction!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current financial situation of the Kingdom, it simply cannot afford such a large project. As for advancing the front line and preparing for a major counter-offensive, I think it is better to postpone the discussion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delgado resolutely refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't have a strategic vision, it's that the Alpha Kingdom is too poor. Now that the war has progressed, the treasury is empty enough to run away mice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no money in his pocket, he, the chancellor of the exchequer, was also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the materials for the construction of the defense line are all local materials, the peasants always have to eat. Affected by the war, domestic food production has plummeted, and it can no longer meet the needs of the whole people, so it can only be purchased from overseas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A penny is hard for a hero, not to mention that the Alpha Kingdom lacks not even a single star. The kingdom's funding gap is tens of millions, which is more than a year's fiscal revenue, and it cannot be squeezed out by the Ministry of Finance if it wants to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Delgado, don't be too anxious. The problem of funds, didn't we just collect a war tax?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grit your teeth and persevere, you can always figure out a way. For the sake of the overall situation, everyone tightened their belts together to live a few years of hard life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let me take the lead. From now until the kingdom's finances improve, I will not receive a salary. All high-level officials in the Kingdom have suspended their salaries, and middle and lower-level officials have cut their salaries by 30% to 50% as appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The budgets of various departments are also suppressed; the rewards for meritorious ministers are only distributed to minor nobles, and the rest are owed first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, pretended to be calm and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is an offending proposition. Since the outbreak of the war, the various welfare benefits of officials have been greatly reduced, and even less will be obtained after such a reduction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Departmental budgets, let alone. After the war broke out, except for the increasing expenditure of the Ministry of Military Affairs, other departments were tightening their belts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the problem of military rewards is the easiest to solve. Because of the war, not only the bounties remained on the books, but even the pensions of the nobles who died in battle were not paid out in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it is Lei, you have to step on it. Who made him the prime minister of the kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the officials, at such a critical moment, if he dared not come out to offend others, he couldn't let King Caesar III go down personally to spread hatred, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, this is still far from enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the Kingdom officials are voluntary, and there are not many who need the Ministry of Finance to pay their salaries, and the Ministry of Finance has already owed everyone two months of salary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The budgets of each department are also pressed again and again. Unless you can suppress the expenditure of the Ministry of Affairs, at most hundreds of thousands of gold coins will be squeezed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bounties of nobles have been embezzled by the Ministry of Finance for a long time. The few million gold coins left in the account are still used for emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crisis we are facing now cannot be solved by throttling. The only way is to open source, for example: levy another war tax, or borrow money from countries in the alliance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, neither of these is a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We collected war tax three times last year alone, and again at the beginning of the year. If we collect it now, many small nobles may not be able to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For foreign debts, I think Earl Francis has more say. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delgado shrugged and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's finances have been able to persist until now, and there has been no bankruptcy. He, the finance minister, can already proudly declare to the outside world: he is worthy of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The chancellor is right, borrowing from countries is not a good option. Referring to our past borrowing cases, this process is not beautiful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, a war bond appeared in the Principality of Moxi. I think the Ministry of Finance can follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with negotiating with the governments of various countries, it is actually easier to raise funds by selling interest-bearing war bonds directly to the nobles at home and abroad. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality of Moxi is selling war bonds everywhere, and there has been a lot of trouble on the mainland for a long time. The war bond was not sold to the Alpha Kingdom because everyone is a \"bad brother\" and life is hard for anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Earl Francis naturally wanted to know what happened in neighboring countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Our current funding gap is as high as more than 30 million gold coins. Can such a large amount of money be borrowed by issuing war bonds?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the lead in stating that usury is impossible. The kingdom's financial resources are limited, and it is impossible to bear more than too high interest. We can't afford even normal private lending! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to borrow money but unwilling to bear high interest is a set of contradictory propositions in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles do have patriotic feelings, but it is still unknown how much gold coins this feeling is worth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the war has been going on until now, and the families of the nobles have also consumed a lot, and they may not be so rich now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is willing to support the kingdom, it may be difficult to spend a large amount of cash to buy war bonds. After all, people have to save money for post-war reconstruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Refer to the interest rate set by the Mosi people, and combine our actual situation, print a batch of war bonds to sell emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the specific figures must be strictly controlled by the Ministry of Finance, and must not exceed the Kingdom's repayment ability! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money that should be spent must be spent. Even if there is no expedition by the Human Race Alliance Army, the newly recovered seven provinces also need to be included in the kingdom's defense line after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you do it now, you can move the border line to the north. Anyway, after so many years, the specific boundary line has become a mystery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be a fool to occupy as many circles as possible without relying on the power of the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using actual actions to create established facts, as long as the Human Race Alliance recognizes it, it will become the legal territory of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about this kind of thing. The overlord of the mainland also wants face. Letting his younger brother give up the benefits that he has eaten in his belly, wouldn't it make all races look down on the human race?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't play too much, exceed your own digestion limit, and attract the jealousy of your allies, then it's not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Marshal Campbell was unfortunately killed. There are so many troops gathered on the front line. It is necessary for us to appoint a new commander. Who do you think is suitable?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, there are really not many generals in the Alpha Kingdom Army who are qualified to serve as frontline commanders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the great nobles in the south were basically excluded from the candidate list for a very simple reason - lack of sufficient military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the nobles in the north, because they have been fighting with orcs all year round, have accumulated more military achievements and have greater influence in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is their advantage, but also their disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the king, whoever has the most military achievements and the highest prestige is not the most suitable commander, and the balance of all aspects must also be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who are the candidates for the Ministry of Military Affairs?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of procedure is necessary. Even if you have your own candidate in mind, you have to look at the reaction of the officials first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to let your subordinates do the nomination. If the general nominated in person is rejected by the officials, it will be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is nothing new in the court. Caesar III is considered a powerful monarch, but he still needs to discuss with everyone on important personnel appointments in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Ministry of Military Affairs proposed a total of six people, namely the Duke of Pias, the Duke of Agiron, the Duke of Dias, the Duke of Cavadia, the Earl of Hudson and the Marquis of James.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Grand Duke Afiero finished speaking, Caesar III frowned. There are six candidates in total, and the first four are members of the five major families in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Duke of Arondo was not killed by the orcs, and the prestige of the heir was not enough, it is estimated that the five major families of the Northland would be shortlisted together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost without thinking, he immediately ruled out the first four.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the nobles of the Northland have too much influence in the army. If their people are appointed as commanders, will they also be given the position of commanders of the standing army in the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the standing army was stationed in the Northland all year round, and the nobles of the Northland had a great influence in the army. If another nobleman of the Northland was appointed as the commander, the military power might completely fall into the hands of the nobles of the Northland in the long run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this kind of situation that cannot be lost is something that no monarch wants to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dear readers, please hand over your monthly pass!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's just that due to the king's face, it's not easy for everyone to directly oppose it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of prestige and military exploits is one aspect, but more is benefit. The same political group does not mean that everyone has the same interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous role of Marquis James was mainly to check and balance Marshal Campbell in the army, and the role he played was not pleasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His own people did not support it, and Caesar III instantly understood that his plan was too hasty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pushing a general with insufficient prestige and combat achievements to the position of coach clearly touched the bottom line of the noble group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, war kills people. If the coach is abolished, one can imagine the fate of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The support for the four great dukes of the North is not only because of their great influence in the court, but most importantly because they have indeed made achievements in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who also made great military exploits, failed to gain widespread support. Except for no one in the court, youth is the biggest shortcoming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Overall, the four dukes have the highest voices, but there are four of them, and Hudson has the largest number of supporters when scattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that the political forces supporting Hudson mainly come from the southwest region of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When suppressing the rebellion before, Hudson also dealt with the families behind these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was this kind of mutual understanding, coupled with the need to check and balance the northern nobles, that allowed him to win the support of these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that all parties were arguing endlessly, Caesar III waved his hand and said: \"I understand everyone's opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These six candidates are all the best generals in the kingdom, but there can only be one commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not an option to keep arguing, so everyone should vote here on behalf of the noble council!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, take paper and pens and distribute them to the ministers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there is nothing wrong with it, it is fair and just, and it seems to be recommended by officials. In fact, Caesar III has already made a choice, and now it is just a formality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People with different identities have different numbers of votes in the noble council. As the king, Caesar III was naturally the one with the most votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the members participate together, the number of votes in his hand cannot influence the decision-making of the parliament, but only some members of the court participate, and the number of votes in his hand is very advantageous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is carried out according to the rules of the political game, and no one can find a reason to oppose it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In almost an instant, political groups that were originally controversial have unified their positions as quickly as possible and clarified the candidates they support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Cavadia 3 votes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl of Hudson 5 votes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Cavadia 7 votes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl of Hudson 8 votes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the original six-person battle turned into a two-strong confrontation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers representing the interest groups of the northern aristocrats supported the Duke of Cavadia one after another; while the influence groups of the southern aristocrats voted for Hudson more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the absence of better options, being young and having no one in the court is not a problem. As long as personal ability and military prestige are in place, everything else is negotiable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supporting irrelevant strangers is better than supporting one's own political enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't come out, Caesar III nominated Marquis James, and it is estimated that all the southern nobles could only bite the bullet and support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the king is worried that the domestic balance will be broken, and the southern nobles are also worried that the northern nobles will continue to grow bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the soaring number of votes, you can tell that the two sides have been biting hard. As for the others, if there are extra votes after the winner is decided, it is estimated that some points can be given to them to avoid embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the voting results with satisfaction, Caesar III said blankly: \"You have all seen the voting results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order to appoint the Earl of Hudson as the commander-in-chief of the army, and the Duke of Cavadia and the Marquis of James as the deputy commanders of the army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the king's voice fell, everyone realized that the humble Marquis James was actually ranked third in the number of votes he received at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all veterans in the political arena, and everyone understood it in an instant. After a long time, this is the real purpose of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also true. Knowing that Marquis James does not meet the requirements of being a coach in all aspects, how can His Majesty the King, who is rich in political experience, push such a person to the top?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really do that, you might as well get off the stage with the cheek and become the commander-in-chief of the army. At least the officers and soldiers on the front line will not reject the king as the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Caesar III also thought about doing it himself. It's a pity that after thinking that the enemy was an unruly orc, he shrank back when the situation came to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, leading troops to fight is really not his specialty. It would be embarrassing if you were fooled by your subordinates and accidentally fell into the enemy's scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Little Caesar is the best negative example. A disastrous defeat on the battlefield buried all the prestige he had accumulated in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The son got into trouble, and he, the old man, took care of it. If something happened to him, no one would be able to clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III, who was cautious, once again took out his best \"balance method\". The combination of a coach + two deputy coaches has perfectly realized the check and balance of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bauhinia Pass, the army once again completed the victory rendezvous, but unfortunately the atmosphere in the hall was a bit embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Principality of Moxi are lucky to say that they are all old friends, and it was very pleasant to talk with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Terran Alliance reinforcements is a bit complicated. There are a lot of chaotic forces, and internal conflicts are visible to the naked eye, which makes Hudson's head big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not even a coalition commander, and when encountering problems, they can only communicate with each other. If one problem is not solved, new problems arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this reason, Hudson has applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs many times, asking them to send capable officers to coordinate the relationship between all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are not stupid. They directly kicked the ball back on the grounds that \"military affairs are involved\" and should be handled by the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach of the army, Hudson, who is destined to be unable to hide, can only bite the bullet. After much effort, he had no choice but to make a bad choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make trouble if you like, anyway, these areas have just been ravaged by orcs, and there is no man's land around, so I'm not afraid of them disturbing the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much fun there is, it's just the armies of various countries rubbing against each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is only the commander-in-chief of the Alpha Kingdom's army, not the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces, and he does not need to be responsible for the armies of other countries. The only thing he can do is to coordinate after a conflict occurs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that when I met an old friend from the Principality of Moxi, the other party had a sympathetic expression. These emotional troubles have all been experienced by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't solve the problem, then solve the person who caused the problem. If you can't even solve the people, you can only separate the people who caused the problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just in time to restore the defense line of the homeland, the family stationed in an area and separated the conflicting teams far away, which could reduce many unnecessary conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are most familiar with the situation in the north. Now we need to build a new line of defense. What the Kingdom means is to allow us to occupy as many territories as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation, we must choose favorable terrain for construction as much as possible on the premise of occupying more land. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already handed a map of the northern part of the kingdom to the Duke of Kavadia, and asked him, a local snake, to draw circles on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene looked very harmonious, and ordinary people couldn't imagine it at all. A few days ago, the two had staged a battle over the command of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the current situation is clearly Hudson has the advantage, otherwise Duke Kavadia would not cooperate in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing surprising. As the coach appointed by the kingdom, he is still the most powerful faction on the front line. If you can't suppress a deputy commander, then there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of command authority is clarified, so it's time to work. Based on the principle that his subordinates should do more and he should do less, Hudson decisively chose to split the tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James was thrown by him to argue with various reinforcements in the alliance. The task of building a line of defense naturally fell to the Duke of Cavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not worried about whether this kind of task distribution will cause problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal conflicts of the Terran Alliance are the problems of the major forces. No matter how big the disturbance is, it has little to do with persuading the fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building a new line of defense, the biggest beneficiaries are the northern nobles, which can protect their territories from orc attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Duke of Cavadia wants to do something, it is estimated that his subordinates will try their best to dissuade him. No matter how hard you try, you can't dig a hole for your own children and grandchildren!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Earl Hudson. I am familiar with the terrain in these areas, so there will be no problem.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He must take over this job. If Hudson is in charge of building the defense line, it will be his turn to worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience told him that the fortifications in front of his house must be built by himself. Throw it to irrelevant southern nobles, who knows if the quality can be guaranteed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, where do you think it is appropriate for us to move the border line? How much land can be enclosed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have it in the pot, you can have it in the bowl. The bigger the cake of the Alpha Kingdom is made, the more cakes can be distributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to fool some of the nobles in the southeastern provinces to develop in the north to make room for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is difficult to operate, but Hudson still did not give up. If you can fool one of them, there will always be a few of so many nobles who will jump into the pit foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I have no way to answer this question. Although the northern land is vast, considering the convenience of building a defense line, there are actually quite a lot of restrictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it should not be difficult to use this opportunity to add one or two provinces to the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The enclosure movement was quickly completed, and the city building work was in full swing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously too late to recruit laborers from the country, so soldiers can only be turned into laborers, and noble officers into foremen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, and the subsequent new legions all became construction teams. As for the elite troops, they are still training normally while being alert to enemy attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is very busy, but Hudson, as the coach, is actually free. Apart from occasionally exchanging feelings with the nobles in the army, there is basically nothing else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, as a rising star, Hudson is still a bit uncomfortable to break into the circle of high-level aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is the military, and the emphasis is on efficiency. All activities are kept simple, otherwise a joke will have to be made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with different people brings different feelings. The most direct gap is vision, and many times Hudson feels that he can't keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, he has never been exposed to the education of the great aristocrats, and most of his knowledge comes from supplementary lessons in recent years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles from all over the world have their own characteristics, but they have one thing in common, that is, strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson suddenly discovered that this war was being used by various forces as a sharpening stone to sharpen his own juniors, as if planning a big move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through constant probing, he was able to hear some information about the Ten Thousand Years Calamity. It's a pity that everyone is very taboo about these news, even if it is revealed inadvertently, the topic will be changed quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others refused to say, Hudson can do nothing. This kind of secret is only recorded by a very small number of ancient families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to family inheritance, the nobles of the Northern Continent are somewhat inferior. As the last territory opened up by the human race, the time it took to truly occupy the Northern Continent was only a total of more than 1,500 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the nobles in the kingdom were descended from descendants of nobles who migrated from the central and southern parts of the mainland. Only a very small number of nobles came from commoner families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, there are still many great nobles with a long history in the kingdom, who maintain contact with the main line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of connection is no longer an ordinary affiliation, but a strategic ally and business partner who are more inclined to watch each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The complex relationship here is not something that people in the circle can't figure out at all. The more things he saw, the more Hudson felt that the world was not friendly to latecomers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder many great nobles were able to stand up again after their decline. The hard work of future generations is only one aspect, and the key is to have strength behind you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that there was a force behind it that made the enemy fearful, I am afraid that after the failure of the struggle, it would not be long before it would be divided up by the pack of wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of this is something Hudson can't envy. Regardless of how much help other families have behind them, the Koslow family is really poor and white.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed a lot of branch people scattered outside; but when it comes to quality, it's hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of them are semi-literate, at most they have only read a few words, and they have received some basic knight training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a very small number of them have a good family background and have completed the basic education of the lower class nobles. Occasionally, a few second- and third-rate talents can emerge, that is all luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the lack of education, given the population base of the Koslow family, how could a few outstanding people be trained in a few hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the class transition has not been achieved, at least a few branches have touched the threshold of the middle-class nobles, only missing the last chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nelson, Evola, these are some of my experience in dealing with people and affairs that I have summed up through my contacts with nobles from all over the world recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You two should study it carefully, learn from it, and then find an opportunity to pass it on to your tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't understand something, you can ask me. In the next few days, I will most likely be free. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, Hudson was also very helpless when it was necessary to popularize the code of conduct of the great nobles to the tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has done similar make-up lessons more than once. However, there are too many debts ahead, and we cannot expect a group of semi-literate people to overcome them all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are many things that are passed on word of mouth and subtly, and there is no written record at all. Many things, even Hudson himself, are groping along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone finds a problem when he is not in communication, he will pretend. When getting along with other nobles, he appeared as a listener most of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you hear, the wider your horizons and insights will be. What's more, he has already experienced the impact of the information explosion, and his ability to accept new things is not ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has become a common practice to screen and teach the things you have learned to your tribe in batches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect can only be said to be better than nothing, mainly depends on personal qualifications. Some people learned a lot, while others learned nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the foundation is too poor. I am used to the logic of the bottom nobles, and it is difficult to adapt to the gameplay among the big nobles in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson actually didn't have too high expectations for the adult children of these families. The real focus of training is still the gang of teenagers in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"OK!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"By the way, Hudson. You have divided out the affairs of the general, will it affect you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now in the camp, there are a lot of gossip. Many people say that you have earned your reputation, but they only know...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through the words, Nelson swallowed again. It's really hard to say, even if they are brothers, it doesn't mean anything, they can say it outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson laughed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's right that there are gossips in the army! I originally let people let it out on purpose. If you don't hear it, it's the problem.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is the fault of youth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being in a high position arouses people's \"jealousy\", which is no big deal; but if it arouses the \"scrupulousness\" of everyone, then it will be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a military commander in his twenties, even thinking about it makes people feel terrible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the sudden change in the political situation in the kingdom, even if there is great credit, this position would not fall on Hudson's head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such a general background, even if he had the opportunity to firmly control the army, he would deliberately put on a very reluctant look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is to make the outside world mistakenly think that his foundation in the army is unstable, and he needs the cooperation of the two deputy commanders to be able to control the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was done not only for Caesar III, but also for all the nobles in the army, and even the two deputy commanders who were divided into powers were also involved in the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a loyal minister of the kingdom, His Majesty the King now needs a balance of power in the army, and Hudson will naturally give him the balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that a group of noble colleagues do not like to see a strong commander, Hudson is also very cooperative in meeting their wishes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this is why Hudson had to retire after the war. At his age, if he dominates the position and does not let go, he can not move for a hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson's foundation in the army is still shallow. In the era of Caesar III, the king could still hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the throne has been passed on for two or three generations, and most of the up-and-coming generals in the army have become his confidantes, which is a real threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be unrealistic to usurp the throne and seek rebellion, but it is as simple as eating and drinking water by taking the king off the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, watching the allied forces of the human race encircle and occupy its own land, but being powerless, is undoubtedly the greatest shame in life for the five emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We can't go on like this, we have to fight back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Xiong Renhuang's words fell to the ground, he heard a \"bang\" sound, and saw that the table in front of him had been torn apart and sawdust flying around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother Xiong, calm down. The actions of the human race are indeed challenging our bottom line, but from another perspective, it also reflects their inner hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they really have the confidence to destroy us, they don't need to be so eager to occupy land and build defense lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    80% of them are Alpha people, who are not optimistic about this war, so they prepare in advance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mostly, he got angry recently, and the tempers of several beast emperors became stronger one by one, which made him, a professional persuasionist, almost unable to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to be unhappy, Alex still didn't discount the role he should play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is to repay the previous bad debts. The mess left by the old Beamon Emperor now falls on him, the heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the weakest existence among the five royal families, Alex must remain rational at all times, and must not act in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't really matter what the Alpha people think. What we need to do right now is: let the enemy do nothing if they want to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easier to destroy than to build. When they are almost built, we can send troops to end their defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, our main task is to calm down the chaos in the country as soon as possible, and we cannot let them add chaos to us at a critical moment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the visible external enemies, the hidden rebels are the most hated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after learning that the rebels have set off civil strife this time, and there are human races behind it, it is even more unbearable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Wolf Emperor is right, we must not let go of any rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance, coming from all directions, it's absolutely impossible to come out just to put on a show, scare us and go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is bound to be a fierce battle to be fought, and the empire is far from ready. We need a complete set of combat plans and countermeasures. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang's analysis made the indoor temperature drop by at least ten degrees. It was the previous plan to fight head-on with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the following series of sudden changes, everyone's expectations are getting lower and lower. From the earliest destruction of the human race to seize the position of the overlord of the mainland, it has fallen to the current survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's go, don't waste your tickets!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The noble officer who presided over the construction of the project hurriedly shouted: \"Don't mess up! Guards, go and inform...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the speech, his position was also exposed, and he was receiving the attention of the Yingren slinging troops above his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, the heart of life in his body was activated quickly, and the knight spear in his hand was already dancing, picking up falling rocks one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, there was a sound of dragon chant from the sky and the earth. As if some terrifying taboo had been triggered, the Yingman slingers who were originally awesome quickly began to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it was still a step too late to react at this time. The pterodactyl cavalry, flying dragon cavalry, and giant eagle cavalry who took off into the air rushed over one after another, as if they were in a competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring the results of the air battle in the sky, the noble officers below were already busy counting the casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human coalition forces were able to respond so quickly, obviously this was not the first time the coalition forces were attacked. It is difficult for everyone to have this ability to cooperate without being beaten a few times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not many soldiers died directly under falling rocks, but in the process of fleeing for their lives in a hurry, there were not a few casualties caused by stampede collisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when, Hudson has appeared on the battlefield, and there are also high-level leaders of the major forces in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People with a little bit of military experience saw this scene and immediately concluded that this was a premeditated trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and Yingren came from the sky every now and then to wreak havoc, making it hard to guard against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long boundary line determines the length of the defense line. Even if only a part of it is being built now, it is still a large construction site winding for hundreds of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Eagles come to cause damage, they often only need to target one point. Relying solely on air force vigilance, and then organizing a counterattack obviously cannot keep up with the enemy's attack speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering a few losses, there was this wave of \"traps\" prepared in advance, waiting for the Eagle Slingers to take the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the performance of your country's army is really...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words were only half spoken, coupled with Blake's half-smile expression, the meaning of ridicule was directly full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone in the same group became melon-eating crowd one after another, all of them looked eager to try, it was clear that watching the excitement was not a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no way, Captain Blake. In order to protect the foundation of the human race, from the beginning of the war to the present, more than 1.07 million soldiers have been killed in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost a generation has been beaten. The soldiers in the barracks are all serfs who have just put down their hoes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to have the current performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is thanks to the Lord of Dawn that our small family can persist until now. I really dare not compare with the great Holy See! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Alpha, the Anti-Holy See is right. What's more, this is still Blake's initiative to provoke trouble, so there is no need to give face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was like a firecracker being ignited. After hearing Hudson's words, Blake's face suddenly became gloomy, and the breath around him continued to rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the nearby melon-eating crowd retreated one after another. Everyone is just watching the fun, and they don't want to be passively involved in this conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in their hearts, everyone despised Blake. The verbal war that he provoked was so unbearable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just a bit of sarcasm: Didn't the Holy See have a vegetarian meal, didn't they perform their due duties?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything you say is true, and you can do it. Are you afraid of being criticized by others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson himself was slightly taken aback. As a high-ranking member of the Holy See, an old-fashioned politician, he was so careless!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon he discovered that something was wrong with Captain Blake in front of him. Where is it that he can't stand the excitement, he is clearly acting on purpose for everyone to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of this, Hudson was also speechless. His intuition told him that there must be some unknown secret behind this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Locked by Blake's murderous aura, Hudson hadn't reacted yet, but Bear Stearns, who was lying on his shoulder, couldn't help it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original pattern of the Earth Bear suddenly came to life, quickly solidified to the size of a fist, and the bear's eyes glared at Blake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really disrespectful to Xiong. Knowing that Hudson and his uncle Xiong are covering him, he still dares to play oppressively, but he obviously doesn't take his earth bear seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the moment when one person and one bear looked at each other, Blake's face turned red all of a sudden, and the sweat on his forehead suddenly appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After failing to overwhelm others, Blake's face was full of embarrassment. This wave of embarrassment has become a big blow, and deep down in his heart, his dissatisfaction with the intelligence department under his command has accumulated to full value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really deceitful. The Earl of Hudson in front of him is full of vitality, and he can't find a trace of death. How could he be the great magister of the undead?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, they wanted to provoke a conflict, exposing the news that Hudson was a necromancer, and using the power of the Human Race Alliance to put pressure on the Alpha Kingdom and force them to replace them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can not only sweep the face of the Alpha Kingdom, but also take the opportunity to break the balance of their domestic political power, sowing hidden dangers for subsequent internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan was perfect, but the ending was very touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden oppression, not only did not find the news of the necromancer from Hudson, but was taught a lesson by the earth bear who woke up from his sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth cannot be revealed, and it is Blake who has deliberately provoked conflicts in the eyes of the outside world. He is narrow-minded and has bad conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typically shooting yourself in the foot when lifting a rock, there is unspeakable suffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, Commander Blake drank too much last night and spent a busy night on.... He hasn't sobered up yet. Please forgive me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked sarcasm came from Sunil's mouth, and everyone who wanted to laugh at first couldn't hold it back anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alcohol is prohibited in the army, which is the prevailing rule in the mainland. Even if you are an alcoholic, if you sneak a little occasionally, there is no reason to get yourself drunk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, Sunil's words are full of ambiguity. \"Busy all night\", what exactly is he busy all night?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be shabby. There is no way to decide the battle now, where can there be so many official duties?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal people would think of women, especially now that the Holy See is known for its extravagance and obscenity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change of style made Blake dumbfounded. This is the rhythm of ruining his reputation, but he still doesn't know how to respond for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open your mouth to refute, if you are busy with women, then you are busy with men, or...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, with the style of the group of unscrupulous aristocrats who watch the excitement and don't think it's a big deal, they will definitely make up countless small jokes for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He gave Sunil a hard look, and he was secretly annoyed. Given the relationship between the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom, seeing Sunil speak just now, he actually thought it was trying to persuade him to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the purpose of persuading the fight was indeed achieved. They were all busy watching Blake's jokes, and they no longer cared about this inconspicuous skirmish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Sunil is too polite, Captain Blake seems to be overworked for the cause of human reproduction, why should I hold on to it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just Captain Blake, although the cause of human reproduction is important, you still have to pay attention to your health!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is as stupid as you, how can we fight the orcs? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson took advantage of the opportunity to make up the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he didn't want to get involved in the dispute between the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom, but he couldn't help himself in the arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trouble is not something you can avoid if you want to. Regardless of the reason, the Holy See has come to find fault. As the representative of the Alpha Kingdom, he must fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sunil is willing to help, so he will naturally give a kind response. As for the Holy See, there is no essential difference between offending once and countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a verbal quarrel, even if it's a quarrel, Hudson doesn't hesitate. The Alpha Kingdom is not that weak. No matter how fierce the quarrel is here, no minister will jump out to impeach him for breaking diplomatic relations with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is no so-called diplomatic relationship between the two major forces, and there are only conflicts and contradictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a burst of laughter, Marquis Olafur, who was watching the excitement, suddenly said: \"Earl Hudson, you really know how to joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's a joke, it's still business. Look at the battle in the sky, it's almost over, let's count the results first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the conflict between the Holy See, the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Alpha, Olafur's joy never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he thought to himself more than once: Take it easy, fight to the end, and the Kingdom of Iberia will be the biggest winner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing that fuels the flames cannot be done too obviously. When the time is right, they still have to play the good old man and come out to persuade them to fight, so as not to be discovered by others about their plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the steps appear, Hudson smiled slightly, spread his hands helplessly, and told everyone with practical actions: I didn't start the matter, you should talk to the troublemakers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming everyone's eyes, Blake, who was already embarrassed, became more and more shameless now, and actually pretended to be dizzy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the farce in front of him, Hudson was speechless. It's obviously not thick-skinned enough. If it was a hardened Lao Lai, he would be able to pretend that nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The episode ended, and the eyes turned to the battlefield. Although Yingman is very vigilant and runs away as soon as he finds danger, a trap is a trap after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In less than an hour of fighting, nearly a thousand Eagle soldiers remained on the battlefield permanently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum up the experience, there are too few Yingren soldiers who launched the attack. If one hundred and eighty thousand soldiers came at once, the coalition forces would definitely not be able to support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that for the Ying people, it is almost impossible to deploy so many troops now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battles, he had lost tens of thousands of troops. Now they have to join hands with the other four major royal families to suppress the domestic rebellion. Given their population base, the troops that can be sent out to launch attacks are already very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if it is true that one hundred and eighty thousand air forces are dispatched at one time, they will also lose money. When the number reaches a certain level, it is the turn of the anti-aircraft firepower to show off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic crystal cannon, magic crossbow, these high-range weapons also have a lot of lethality against air targets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not used very much now, because there are not many eagle people, and the battlefield for the sneak attack is not sure. Before the heavy weapon had time to lock on, the enemy had already thrown stones and fled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the corpses of the Eagles that were constantly being carried over, Hudson couldn't help sighing: \"Dragon Cavalry, they really are the kings of the air!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Becoming a dragon knight is the dream of countless people in the mainland. However, there are not many things that can be achieved, and the dragon cavalry is even more invisible, and the second-best sub-dragon is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the many sub-dragon races, pterosaurs and flying dragons are not considered powerful. Most of them are Tier 3 monsters, and occasionally a few flying dragons evolve into Tier 4 or 5 monsters, but they are all kings in the group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to become the kings of the human air force is not only because they are more powerful than griffins, giant eagles..., but also because they have the same characteristics as griffins - living in groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of flying dragons usually consists of hundreds of flying dragons. If they can be domesticated, a flying dragon cavalry can be formed soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The greedy Hudson can't wait to go to the Warcraft Mountains immediately. But rationality made him stop. If it was as simple as imagined, the dragon cavalry would have been flying all over the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taming Warcraft is a long-term process. Judging from the number of monster knights, we can see that the monster races living in the wild are rarely subdued by humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this kind of gregarious monster, if you are not careful, you will be called by your friends to come over and directly stage a live dismemberment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why, Earl Hudson wants to form a sub-dragon cavalry?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James on the side asked half-jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal people know this is impossible. With the small fortune of the Koslow family, domesticating a few sub-dragons is not bad. If you want to form a sub-dragon cavalry, it will go bankrupt every minute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of money is the best solution of all troubles. As long as you are willing to think of a way, there is still hope for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most difficult thing is to domesticate, this kind of secret technique is strictly sealed by the royal families of various countries. Many aristocrats with ancient heritages have no relevant knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally cultivate a few monsters, which are also subdued by conventional means. Only the top aristocrats are eligible to own an established air force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course, this is the dream of all nobles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If given the chance, I would definitely form a dragon cavalry. If it doesn't work, other flying Warcraft cavalry can also. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Without the giant of the Holy See to take the lead in doing things, the internal conflicts in the alliance have been reduced a lot at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is winking, and they know very well that the big forces above have stopped making trouble. If they make troubles at this time, they will set themselves on fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you unfortunately become the focus of the big power game, then you have to passively stand in line. In a short period of time, there may be no troubles, but it will be hard to say when the war is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not too many forces that are declining due to standing on the wrong team in the history of the human race. There are many lessons learned from the past, so it is natural to learn lessons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See settled down, but Hudson was dumbfounded. Originally thought that Blake came here to find fault with preparations, but now it seems that it was purely on a whim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he realized that he seemed to have tricked the Holy See again. Back then, in order to sell the \"Blood Moon Horn\" for a good price, he made a cameo appearance as the great magister of the undead, but he didn't expect the people in the Holy See to really believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also speechless. For such an important matter, I don't know how to verify it before launching it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with his current status, it seems that the Holy See is also difficult to verify. Unless it is during a gathering, it is difficult for people in the Holy See to get close to him in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some reason, Hudson always felt wrong. Even if the identity of the great magister of the undead is real, it won't be much lethal if it is revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of necromancers is indeed bad, but apart from the Holy See who is shouting and shouting, other forces are not so hostile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the break with the Holy See, necromancers have openly appeared in the kingdom's mage group, and even arcanists and wizards who are considered blasphemous by the Holy See have made public appearances in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant Hudson came to his senses. The Holy See's move was not for his life, but for the military power in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The identity of a necromancer is too intimidating, and it is not enough to shout and kill, but professional discrimination still exists. Once his identity is hammered, the position of Hudson's coach will definitely not be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he steps down now, the next ones who have the chance to take over are the Marquis of James and the Duke of Cavadia. Some of these two people are in collusion with the Holy See!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reaching this conclusion, Hudson was in a bad mood. Foreign enemies cannot defeat the Alpha Kingdom, but internal troubles are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who is colluding with the Holy See, it means that the Holy See's tentacles have secretly extended into the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not too worried about the dispute between the Kingdom and the Holy See. Everyone has been fighting for so many years, and it is estimated that all methods have been used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if he involved himself, that would be intolerable. If you don't find out the enemy's tentacles and cut them off, wouldn't it appear that he is easy to bully?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I don't have any clues now. In Blake's capacity, Hudson can't arrest people for interrogation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Have no clue at all, it is really too difficult to find the traitor in the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this failure, the enemy's next actions are bound to become more subtle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No clues could be found, and Hudson looked like a traitor to everyone. Behaving more and more cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time flies, half a year later. In the past years, the front line has generally been peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within the alliance, there were occasional quarrels between several major powers, creating gossip topics for everyone in their boring lives, and no major disturbances occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs came over to attack and sabotage at the beginning, but after suffering a few big losses, the Yingren also learned how to behave, and no longer came to throw stones foolishly. Even if it was an order from the imperial court, it was mostly dealt with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. The Terran Alliance has improved its efficiency, and the first to arrive on the battlefield is the Air Force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they only took out part of their wealth, hundreds of forces, large and small, gathered together and still gathered an air force team of more than 20,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure instantly shifted to Yingren. Even in a decisive battle, the Terran Air Force would not be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, these human forces who don't talk about martial arts, in order to better deal with the Ying people, have equipped the air force with magic crossbows one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the rich and powerful human race, the performance of the orc empire is much poorer, and they can only make up with bows and arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For high-end products such as magic crossbows, the output of the Orc Empire is already low, and the cost is frighteningly high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the outbreak of the war, the Alpha Kingdom blocked all trade routes, causing them to directly lose their production capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no precision parts made by the dwarves, and the magic crossbows made by the orc empire are all giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the smallest magic crossbow weighs five or six hundred catties. It's okay for the infantry to use it, but if it's used by the eagle soldiers, I'm afraid it can only be carried by two or three people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding a bow and arrow and shooting at the magic crossbow, Hudson couldn't help crying when he saw that scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carnage!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naked massacre!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intensive fire strikes often only need one face-to-face to deal a heavy blow to the Eagle Air Force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few strong Yingmen who can rush over to fight hand-to-hand, ordinary Yingren soldiers often die before the enemy can touch them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is the best teacher. Reason tells Hudson that there is a high probability that there will be a big era of magic crossbow explosion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the production cost of the magic crossbow can be reduced, the next continental war mode will be completely rewritten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the lowest-level soldiers, even ordinary knights have little resistance to magic crossbows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even sky knights can't resist the dense magic crossbow for long. Once the power of the life seeds in the body is exhausted, there is no choice but to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the development and popularization of war-related weapons is fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exact time when the magic crossbow was born is impossible to verify, but the portable miniature magic crossbow actually appeared forty or fifty years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by cost, it has not been equipped on a large scale. However, research in related fields has never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the various shapes of magic crossbows in everyone's hands, you can tell that these things are made by different alchemists, and they are obviously the results of the major forces over the years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What made Hudson speechless the most was that these results were not the result of people deliberately organizing manpower to study them, but just a sideline business created by the alchemists to make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It can't go on like this, the strength shown by the human race is much stronger than that during the last continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enemy air units in particular, over a third equipped with miniature magic crossbows. The shortest range is more than one hundred meters, and the farthest can even reach three or four hundred meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people and enemies are fighting, and many times we have suffered heavy losses before we have time to get close!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past six months, a total of 7,000 Eagle Warriors died on the battlefield, and the casualties to the enemy would never exceed 3,000, including the enemy's ground troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we can also mass-produce magic crossbows, this war will simply not go on! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ying Renhuang said with a livid face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought it would be a good job to make trouble for the enemy and play air strikes, but I didn't expect that the losses would be so heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What worried the Emperor Yingren most was the speed of development of the human race. If this situation continues, the living environment of the Orc Empire in Aslante will only get worse and worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor, calm down first. We have almost suppressed the domestic rebellion, and the next step is the decisive battle with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the power of the empire is obviously insufficient to defeat the enemy head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The danger of the magic crossbow really needs to be carefully considered, but it is not without a solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crisis has spread, and we are not the only ones who need to accept the challenge. All ethnic groups in the mainland must reconsider the threat of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Record the battle screen of the magic crossbow, and send someone to the dwarves, and they will know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, follow the old rules, trade space for time, and slowly consume with the human race amidst steady resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to worry too much. The human race together is indeed invincible on the mainland, but the human race alliance has long since split.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We need to face a human race composed of hundreds of forces, not a unified human race. The consumption of internal competition alone will at least consume more than half of their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lips are dead and the teeth are cold. As long as the rulers of the various races in the mainland are not stupid, it is impossible to watch the human race destroy us. With the deterioration of the empire's situation, various races will definitely put pressure on the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, as long as it drags on for a while, and then finds a mediator to surrender to the human race, the war should be over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex tried to comfort him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic experience of the eagle race is just the beginning, and as the war progresses, more races will encounter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Alex couldn't help but secretly delighted. Finally, there is a backing, and they are no longer unlucky for the Beamon clan alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor, what Emperor Bimon said makes sense. What we have to do now is to persevere. The human race is indeed very powerful, but all races in the mainland are not vegetarians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the time to start this war was too hasty, and I didn't have time to coordinate the relationship with the various ethnic groups, otherwise I wouldn't be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering this loss, as long as we learn the lesson, there will still be opportunities in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the miniature magic crossbow in the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the relationship with the dwarves is established, making spare parts is no longer a problem, and we also have the possibility of large-scale equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, we will also develop sea transportation, trade with the dwarves by sea, and completely break the blockade of the Alpha Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From that calm and calm tone, it is completely impossible to see that this war was initiated by him, let alone a trace of guilt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that being the boss is different. The strength didn't increase much, but the thickness of the skin increased first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The style of speaking and doing things is exactly the same as that of the old Beamon Emperor who passed away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although the domestic war has been extinguished, military spending remains high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be a host. The food, drink and toilets of the reinforcements must be provided by the host. The little assistance given by the Terran Alliance is less than 20% of the real expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Millions of troops have been busy on the front line for more than half a year, and they did one thing - build a defense line, and domestic criticism gradually increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone is deliberately finding fault, it's because the expenses on the front line are too huge, which has brought heavy pressure on the kingdom's finances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a large amount of funds were raised through the issuance of war bonds, it is almost swallowed up by the war now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What did the Earl of Hudson say?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has become the consensus of the kingdom to end this war as soon as possible. But when it comes to specific operations, we still have to watch the performances of the frontline coaches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Earl Hudson believes that the reinforcements gathered at the front line can already launch an attack on the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the communication on the front line is not smooth, and there are many contradictions among the major forces, which has brought great trouble to the coordination work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In particular, the coalition forces lack a unified command structure, and the major forces maintain a high degree of independence, so it is difficult to convince all forces at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He suggested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs strengthen communication with the Terran Alliance Parliament and form a coalition command to promote the progress of the war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words of the Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, immediately aroused a lot of discussion among the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficult communication and inconvenient command are the persistent problems of the coalition forces. There were no problems that could be solved in previous wars, and naturally they should not be solved easily now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III was also in a difficult situation. The Marquis James, who is currently in charge of the communication work on the front line, is a confidant he single-handedly promoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have always been conscientious in my work, but many times it is not hard work that can be rewarded. If the major forces do not buy it, there is nothing he can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar to distressed letters, Caesar III has received many letters in the past six months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being the boss doesn't like the younger brother complaining when he encounters difficulties, but there is one exception, that is, when encountering difficulties that cannot be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Complaining about suffering, at least proves that we are still working hard. If you don't even complain about suffering, it's purely bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperors of the kingdom have not been able to solve historical problems. It is obviously difficult for the generals on the front line to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces lack a unified command, which is essentially a political problem. All parties cannot agree politically, and it is even more difficult to keep consistent militarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't look at me like this, in order to coordinate the relationship with all parties, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already broken its legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get reinforcements from all sides in place as soon as possible, we have used all means. Now it involves military command power, which is really beyond the competence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all parties are willing to let go of their prejudices, it will not be our turn to be the final commander of the coalition forces. Introduce an uncontrollable commander to dominate this war, the situation may not be better than it is now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis retorted mercilessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diplomacy is not a panacea, it is essentially a game of interests. The coalition forces do not have a unified command system, and the core reason is that they cannot agree on interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most human nations, the threat of the orc empire is too illusory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Willing to help, it is for the sake of the righteousness of the human race, wanting the command of the army-no way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what Earl Francis said is not unreasonable. Even we ourselves are unwilling to hand over the army to others, let alone other forces?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to follow the old rules, and all combat plans are implemented after discussion and approval by all parties. If the dispute persists, it will be reported to the Human Race Alliance Council for a ruling! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A typical bad idea, but it is the only way to solve the problem right now. How can we get everyone to work **** the battlefield without first convincing all parties?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If there is no better choice, then do this! Earl Hudson, please pay attention to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young people tend to be impulsive. At this critical moment, you can't make trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said in low spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The uncontrollable situation is always the king's most annoying thing. Now that he has come to this step again, it really does not make him happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bloodmoon Castle, the castle guarded by the human race that fell to the hands of the orcs eighty years ago, reappeared on the land of Northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall shape and layout are almost the same as the original ancient castle, but the position between the old and new castles is different by four or five hundred miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson played the role of a supervisor as usual, patrolling the construction site from time to time, proving to the outside world that he, the coach, is not just idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is an urgent message from the capital!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the panting voice of the guard, Hudson frowned. Recently, the front line has been calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs hadn't settled down, he wouldn't have time to spare and went to inspect the construction site. On the surface, they are inspecting the speed of defense line construction, but in fact they are traveling all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of the importance attached to the quality of the project, the deputy coach, the Duke of Cavadia, is more concerned than the coach. The only difference is that the project is spent on food and lodging every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Duke of Kavadia, but all the nobles in northern Xinjiang showed great enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it fails to meet the requirements, it will immediately order rework without any hesitation. If the progress can't be kept up, even if the personal guards in hand help, they are not willing to sacrifice the quality of the project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because of the seriousness of this loyalty to the king, Hudson changed his previous prejudice against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the northern Xinjiang nobles have various problems, but they are definitely not Liaodong generals who are bent on making money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the urgent letter and scanning it, Hudson was slightly taken aback. Secretly guessed: Is my plan to dump the pot, has this been seen through?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, the second batch of reinforcements from the Terran Alliance has reached 500,000 people one after another. Adding the previous 300,000, it is now as high as 800,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Together with the 200,000 troops of the Moxi Principality, the 30,000 troops gathered by the Warhammer Kingdom, and the 700,000 troops of the Alpha Kingdom on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood Moon Castle has gathered more than 1.7 million troops. Even if the 600,000 troops in the Northern Three Kingdoms Army are deducted, there are still 1.1 million elites, enough to launch a full-scale counterattack against the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in taking action, the biggest problem is that the relationship within the alliance has not been coordinated. To put it simply: all major forces are worried that they will suffer losses and others will take advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each of them wanted to wait until all the reinforcements from the alliance arrived, and then set off against the orc empire together. Otherwise, it would be too much of a disadvantage if the troops who came first took the lead and the reinforcements followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the essence of the problem, Hudson did not rush to solve it, but threw the trouble to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is still the fault of age. A 20-year-old army coach is very eye-catching. If he behaves too outstandingly, it will cause too much hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of military affairs, Hudson did not dare to collapse, so he could only be slow in handling complicated diplomatic relations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the communication work was thrown to Marquis James, Hudson stopped asking, and let him toss the whole process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Caesar III still has some vision in employing people. Under the efforts of Marquis James, there were no major achievements and no disturbances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem inconspicuous, but it is actually very powerful. As a military general, he can coordinate the relationship between hundreds of forces, and he is a proper military socialite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is too much. If it was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ability of Marquis James would definitely be very good, but it is different in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While being too communicative, it also makes people think that he is too hypocritical, good at drilling and sycophant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the position he held before, he had to report to Caesar III from time to time, so his reputation in the army would naturally not be high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to invite Marquis James to discuss matters. Your Excellency the Duke, you should also read the urgent letter from the capital!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already handed the letter to the Duke of Cavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach and the deputy coach check and balance each other, but it doesn't mean that everyone will fight to the death, especially when encountering a coach like Hudson who is good at decentralizing power, it makes people lose their temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are realistic. After leaving the most important defense task to the Duke of Cavadia, the northern nobles who were originally hostile to Hudson were left with the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of construction sites, big and small, are under construction at the same time. Duke Kavadia is so busy every day that he never leaves the ground, and there is no time for infighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same method is also applicable to Marquis James. Fighting wits and bravery with major forces every day is already exhausting, and there is no time to study internal fighting at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be idle. Even if the front line is fine, Hudson can make things happen. For example: Occasionally plan a multinational joint operation, an in-depth attack on the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multinational joint action is required, and Marquis James, who is in charge of coordinating relations, will be busy soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the Orc Empire to do things without being familiar with the situation. The work pressure of the Duke of Kavadia also needs to be passive +1.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't fantasize about refusing, and seek his own affairs in his position. All the tasks assigned by Hudson were unavoidable within the scope of their duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is very busy, and the conflicts and conflicts between them are invisible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, judging from the meaning of the letter, the patience of the capital has been exhausted, and they want to launch a full-scale counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the core issue of command authority, and there is no sign of it being resolved. According to the king's capital, the next battle will probably be quarrelsome. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are close to the water get the moon first. The kingdom's border moved northward, and the most direct beneficiaries were the nobles of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only have the opportunity to expand the fief, but also let their lair change from a dangerous battlefield to a safe hinterland of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The common interests made the northern nobles gradually change from opposing Hudson to cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the good reputation earned by dispatching troops in time to find people regardless of personal gains and losses also played a big role in bonus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wait for Marquis James to come over, let's discuss it first, and then resolve it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance his authority, he did not use less means. The biggest change is that the previous joint meeting of senior military officers has become a three-person meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fewer people participated in the meeting, and the conflicts of interest involved were also greatly reduced. As long as their own interests are not involved, the three of them can basically handle problems objectively and fairly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone below dares to make trouble on purpose, they will challenge the common authority of the three, and naturally they will be jointly suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As a confidant of Caesar III in the army, Marquis James received the news one step ahead of the coach Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having worked together for more than half a year, he also has a good understanding of Hudson's virtues. Past experience told him that there is a high probability that this tricky chore will still fall on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the person in charge of coordinating foreign affairs in the military, he simply couldn't push him away. It doesn't matter if you want to be bad, everyone knows that he is good at communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's division of personnel and powers, including Caesar III, is recognized by Hudson based on his personal ability and actual needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After racking his brains, he couldn't find a clue. The Marquis James, who was in an extremely bad mood, forced himself to come to the meeting with a smiling face after receiving the notice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People who love to laugh will not have bad luck. This is a good habit he has cultivated since he was a child. Even if you know that the front is full of difficulties and obstacles, you will still deal with it with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was born in a noble family, the Marquis James is only a descendant of a distant branch. In addition to bearing a noble surname, it is more appropriate to say that he came from a merchant family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since their grandfather, their lineage has been in decline, and the huge debts left by their ancestors forced them to embark on the road of doing business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A skinny camel is bigger than a horse. The combination of power and money is always the fastest way to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the protection of the family and his good business talent, his grandfather quickly became successful in the business field. By the generation of his parents, he had already become one of the largest merchants in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps they have accumulated enough wealth. In James' generation, the elders feel that their family has enough money and must return to the center of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The talented James, under the golden bullet offensive of his parents, was soon recommended by his family, and was sent to the side of Caesar III who had not yet succeeded to the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James, who had been educated in pragmatism since he was a child, was obviously more able to lower his face than other noble children. He quickly stood out from many competitors and became a confidant of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Caesar III came to power, James directly started his career path, making contributions and overcoming obstacles along the way to obtain his current status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The closer to the center of power, the more disturbed James is. It is not easy to be the king's confidant. While pleasing the king, it is inevitable to offend a group of big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the bad reputation he bears is due to these people, and the remaining half is due to the jealousy of the middle and small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar troubles also exist in Hudson. Especially after serving as the commander-in-chief of the army, all kinds of criticisms have never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that Hudson made a dungeon in the Principality of Moxi in the early stage, and he didn't offend anyone much. The first battle to reach the front line is still rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other nobles can spray him, but the rescued nobles cannot. Even if you don't appreciate it in your heart, you have to put on a show on the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the fact that there are so many nobles who have been rescued, some of them will always say good things to him, and occasionally come out to help say a few good words, which prevents his reputation from being swallowed up by \"jealousy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is always easy for the same kind to cherish each other. The relationship between James and Hudson is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that both of them are rationalists, and they are destined not to be true friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the vast prairie outside the city wall, the three met each other with wry smiles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what they need to face is not only the problem of speeding up the pace of war, but also the destruction of the orc empire. The appetite of the kingdom does not match the strength at hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis James, the pressure is now on you. If you want to launch a major counterattack in advance and destroy the orc empire in one fell swoop, you must get all kinds of reinforcements.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a little embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc empire can be destroyed, the names of the three of them will last forever, leaving a strong mark in the history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that after Hudson calculated all the possibilities, he came to the conclusion: In order to destroy the orc empire, the human race must be integrated first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open the map and you will know that the land area occupied by the orc empire is one-third of the territory of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of millions of square kilometers, such a vast territory, let alone occupying it, it may take several years to just march around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For such an obvious problem, the dignitaries in the royal capital are naturally aware of it. The slogan calls for the destruction of the orc clan, but few take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can defeat the orc empire, but it is the real strategy of the kingdom. Defeating and destroying are two concepts, and the difficulty in the middle is hundreds of times greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the five royal families of the orcs are severely damaged and they lose their control over the orc empire, this multi-racial mixed empire will collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is exactly what Hudson is most worried about. The existence of the five royal families certainly preserved the orc empire, but they also imprisoned the development of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain their own rule, the countless powerful races in the Orc Empire, under their blows, were declining, declining, and destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they are defeated, it is equivalent to letting go of the valve. The orc race without the constraints of the five royal families can reproduce to their heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the human race can occupy the huge territory of the orc empire in a short period of time, in the next few decades, many powerful races will inevitably rise on this land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Solve a hidden danger and create a bigger hidden danger. Hudson really doesn't want to take the risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Caesar III seems to have confirmed this plan and has been trying to push it forward. Even though he, the front-line coach, has repeatedly warned of risks, he still hasn't been able to change the King's determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason Hudson is generally clear, it is nothing more than for the inheritance of the royal family. Caesar III had only one son, but the ability of this son could not reassure him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keep the orc empire, and the orcs will definitely make a comeback in a few decades. The shrewd Caesar III didn't think his son could stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the current performance of Crown Prince Caesar is hard to be reassuring. If it weren't for the kingdom's strict inheritance laws, he would have wanted to practice the trumpet again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heir cannot be changed, so he can only pave the way for his son in advance, and first clear the thunder that may erupt in the future in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for opening the **** for the orcs, and whether they will rise again in the future, he really can't care so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, if you deal with them hard, you can get decades of peace and ensure the succession of the throne to your grandchildren.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The further question is that it is something in the distant future. Who can say for sure what will happen then?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you really think too highly of me. The composition of the coalition forces is too complicated. Just stationed here usually, conflicts emerge endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is on the battlefield, it will be even more uncontrollable. Without a unified command system, the coordination and cooperation at that time will have to be borne by us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong a person's communication skills are, they can't change the nature of the world. Even if he spits out fragrance, he will not be able to unite a group of people with different thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, no one can tell what will happen on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need to do now is to launch a major counterattack as soon as possible and send them to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the hatred between our human race and the orcs, the most basic bottom line, everyone can still abide by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can convince everyone to act together, then act together. If there are no conditions, then each fights his own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the coalition forces, even if everyone kills without purpose, it is enough for the Orc Empire to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom is pressing so hard, and there may be financial problems. I roughly estimated that the daily expenses on the front line will not be less than 80,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consider the price increase brought about by the war and the consumption during transportation. The actual military expenditure should be several times this figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it keeps procrastinating like this, I am afraid that the kingdom's finances will go bankrupt before the war is over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military expenditures cannot be reduced. It's just that the kingdom issued a war bond before and got a large amount of cash into the account, so everyone didn't think about suppressing military expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the front-line coach, it is impossible for Hudson to take the initiative to reduce military expenditures. All he will do is ask for food and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's debt problem, then owe it first! According to what he has learned, once a country embarks on the road of borrowing, it is almost impossible to escape from the debt trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now no one thinks about defaulting on the contract, so they are worried that the debt is too much, which exceeds the kingdom's repayment ability, and they want to urge the front line to speed up the pace of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will do my best! But Your Excellency, are you ready for this war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real dilemma now is not sending troops, but after the army goes out. If the enemy cannot be defeated for a long time, the logistical pressure will be too great! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James said a little nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for Hudson to answer, the Duke of Cavadia on the side said first: \"Your Excellency the Marquis, your worries are unnecessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the next decisive battle, as early as half a year ago, we were making preparations. There are so many dried meat in the tent to dry, which is the best evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to start at this moment, the most important thing is the season. It was the end of August, and the army was attacking at the right time to destroy the orcs' autumn harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we didn't achieve much results on the battlefield, we have brought heavy damage to the Orc Empire outside the battlefield! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Marquis James showed a happy smile on his face, but he was scolding his mother deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, he didn't even inform him of such important news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Duke of Cavadia hadn't spoken out now, he would have been kept in the dark when the army set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, his heart is strong enough to restrain his emotions. If it was a general with a bad temper, and encountered such obvious distrust, I am afraid that he would have to go crazy on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"James, don't think too much. I didn't inform you at the time, mainly because there were too many military affairs, and we forgot about it for a while.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to comfort him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, it is all the fault of reputation. As the king's confidant, whoever reports to the king's capital every now and then, whoever is the coach has to be on guard!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king had known, they were preparing for the expedition in advance, and they might have ordered them to attack earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to delay time and increase his own chances of winning, Hudson has made a lot of efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't worry! Such a trivial matter is not worth mentioning at all. The main reason is that I am too careless. If I pay attention to it, I should have thought of it long ago.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James said rather reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, he is not at all peaceful. Originally thought that his ability was already powerful enough, and he did not win the position of coach because of the game between the king and the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reality slapped him hard. He thought he knew everything about military affairs, but he was still taught a lesson by his juniors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a master who is good at observing words and expressions, James is very keen to capture the sarcasm on Duke Cavadia's brow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he suddenly felt that Hudson was not the only one who was being kept from the truth about Hudson's preparations in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the Duke of Kavadia in front of him has enjoyed the same treatment as him. It's just that he has rich experience and can see through Hudson's calculations at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the so-called concealment is not really trying to hide it from them, but a test of their military capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army reserves a large amount of dried meat in advance, and asks the kingdom for various strategic materials one after another. This is not preparing for war, what else can it be doing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before I was busy making contacts and coordinating the relationship between the major forces, even the obvious exam questions were ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, James couldn't help doubting himself: Such important details have been ignored, so is it really difficult for me to lead soldiers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson shook his head secretly. He recognized Marquis James' ability, but unfortunately he paid too much attention to personal connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a general in the army puts his focus on making connections, he has already set foot on the road of no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Marquis James, who is quite capable, does not have enough outstanding military exploits, so it is really not bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When people's energy is scattered, even if the opportunity is given to them, they may not be able to grasp it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the end of the episode, there was another rift between the three-person command team. Hudson was completely unresponsive to this change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be a coach, especially if you hold the elite of the country, it is even more difficult to be a coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poorly coordinating the relationship between the generals under his command is a sign of incompetence; having a good relationship with the generals under his command is even more of a sin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally the two deputy commanders who were arranged by the king to check and balance himself.

Under the auspices of a cardinal, they sincerely prayed for the blessing of the Lord of Dawn!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a trivial matter is obviously not enough to alarm the Lord of Dawn, the old man, so there are no miracles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little bit of difficulty, obviously it won't bother the magic sticks. If the miracle does not appear, then use magic to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of priests worked together, the sky was filled with golden light, and the air was filled with a sacred atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the holy light, the soldiers who were originally nervous became full of energy in an instant. It was as if all the negative emotions had been cleared away at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was also blinded. Sure enough, it is not without reason that the Holy See has been able to pass on for so many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cult organizations use drugs to mentally stimulate believers, which is as powerful as the Holy Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Blake's triumphant look, Hudson wanted to go up and give him two slaps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is too much hatred, everyone is on the high platform, why is the golden light on his body so dazzling?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Blake is the protagonist today, and everyone is a supporting role. Being able to appear here is all thanks to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of the soldiers, Hudson, like the representatives of the major forces on the high platform, silently chose to write down the account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See wants to spread the faith and reshape their supremacy in the mainland, which is contrary to everyone's interests. Now that they have such a place, it is obviously an eye salve for the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary soldiers at the bottom do not have that much discernment ability. Everyone thought that this was really the blessing of the Lord of Dawn, and the degree of devout faith was going up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the Lord of Dawn has added thousands of devout believers just now, and even dozens of fanatics appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can guarantee that this kind of activity will only appear once in the coalition forces. Anyone who participates in the future will be a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See is allowed to continue to toss like this, I am afraid that it will not be long before the soldiers under everyone's command will be pulled over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a price to be paid for blatant poaching. If you don't take revenge and go back, the bad breath in everyone's hearts may be difficult to swallow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of ceremonies, it was already afternoon. The so-called big army marched out, but the whole army stepped out of the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there are not many troops participating. If a million troops are gathered together, it is estimated that they will not be able to get out today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a joint operation in name, but in fact it is still fighting independently. Only when you meet the main force of the orcs, will everyone cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At midnight, the coalition meeting was still arguing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Hudson wouldn't believe what he said. The army is still discussing how to fight and where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a sequela of a high degree of autonomy. More than a hundred forces representing the human race have more than a hundred ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small and medium-sized forces are okay to say, they just express their opinions and brush up their own sense of existence. Most of the time, he plays the role of a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is a group of big forces. Hudson saw the Holy See and several big kingdoms arguing there, and no one could convince anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a representative of the Alpha Kingdom, he should have participated in the discussion, but Hudson is used to it and is not interested in such meaningless quarrels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason, no matter how sufficient it is, so what?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others disagree, or disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't force others to approve it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't convince all parties, and your fists are not enough to make them submit, then it is a waste of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, it's getting late. If you can't argue about the route of dispatching troops, before you meet the main force of the orcs, you should fight your own way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now let's talk about logistics first. The coalition forces add up to more than one million troops, including 200,000 cavalry. The supplies consumed by the army every day are an astronomical figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the seizures from the front line alone, I am afraid that even half of the material needs cannot be met. I suggest…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson finished speaking, Blake interrupted angrily: \"There is no need to propose, just do as you wish, and the army of the Alpha Kingdom will be responsible for escorting the logistics supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you feel that the troops are insufficient, then add the troops of the Principality of Mosi and the Kingdom of Warhammer. With so many people, it can always meet the logistics of the army, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not very harmful, but extremely insulting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Blake's words, Hudson's face suddenly became gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the combat effectiveness of our own army is indeed quite behind in the coalition army, there is no need to say it so directly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the hundreds of thousands of cannon fodder corps that are holding back, the rest of the kingdom's army can still fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the kingdom's heavy losses in the previous battles, Hudson would definitely go back to the past. Now, forget it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and the Alpha Kingdom has lost more than 60% of its military strength, and it is inevitable that it will be unable to compete with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, don't be angry. Captain Blake's mouth is always ugly, don't take his words to heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the logistics of the army, according to the past practice, your country took the lead in organizing it, and this time is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you need anything, you can mention it to us. If you can cooperate, everyone will cooperate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be persuading a fight, but it is actually fighting. It's a pity that Hudson is only young physically, but his heart has been tempered and beaten by society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now jumping out to fight with the Holy See, even if you win the fight, what can you gain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task of escorting food and grass, he, the host, cannot escape at all. Although Blake's words are stinky, they are also in line with the interests of all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone has come so far, and everyone can't work in vain. If you don't kill a few orcs, how can you go home and pretend to be aggressive?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even better if I could make a small fortune by the way. After all, it is an empire, no matter how poor it is, there is money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the soldiers, when the coalition army arrived at the front line, there were rumors in the army how luxurious the life of the nobles of the Orc Empire was, how much money and supplies they robbed in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the minds of many people, attacking the orc empire now is simply to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not entirely a rumor, because the properties of the two races are different. Many things that are rare and common in the orc empire become invaluable when they reach the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson just secretly contributed to the flames, deliberately exaggerating the wealth of the five royal families of the orcs, and magnifying everyone's greed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. If you don't fool around, there is no way to increase the enthusiasm of the coalition forces!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the question of whether or not they will be cheated later, that also depends on them conquering the royal court of the orcs. Hudson never said that ordinary orc tribes are also very rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured. I will naturally not take such a small matter to heart. I am working hard for the cause of my human race, and there is no division of labor regardless of high or low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just to **** logistics supplies, we have taken over this task. It's just that the situation on the battlefield has changed suddenly, and our transportation of food and grass can't keep up with everyone's speed of action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is too far apart from each other, it may be difficult to deliver food and grass in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So I suggest that when you launch an attack, it is best not to spread your troops too much. The food and grass we transported are only sent to everyone's camp, and you will distribute the small troops below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of arrangement, it is best to carry not less than one month's grain and grass with the army. In case the army advances too fast and the grain transportation team fails to catch up in time, it will not affect the combat effectiveness of the army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaccination is a must. If you don't bring the ugly words to the fore, the army will be defeated in the future, and the logistics will be the target of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone looked at each other, each of them lost in thought. For any army, logistics is always the most important part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay when they are working together. Once everyone is separated, it is unknown whether the logistics team can find their positions in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era without positioning and navigation, traveling mainly depends on the sun to identify the direction. Even the scouts sent out to investigate may get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson's proposal is of great practical value. Everyone pay attention, don't be too troublesome, it can save lives at critical moments!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur reminded with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just watching a movie is not enough. There are too many stories about the boss fighting with the second child and killing the third child.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For its own safety, the Kingdom of Iberia needs more allies. Marquis Olafur didn't mind coming a few more times for such a friendly reminder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the people talking in twos and threes, Hudson shook his head secretly. A group of people are all dramatists, and it is getting harder and harder for honest people to get along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transporting food and grass is hard work, but it is also a beautiful job. Compared with fighting on the battlefield, the safety factor is relatively higher, and the supply of materials is also more sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't do the immoral things of embezzling military rations and shoddy. But it is still possible to take advantage of the opportunity to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to do it, I'm not in a hurry yet. If you want to make a fortune, you have to wait until after the war starts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If there is no objection, then the task of transporting food and grass will be handed over to Earl Hudson. The army of the Alpha Kingdom is at the core, and the armies of the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi are responsible for assisting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil made a final decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is better to fight alone with pig teammates and enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not at all surprised by the reaction of his allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is full of confidence and ready to make a fortune, as if the orcs can be destroyed with a snap of their fingers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For one's own fame and fortune, the drudgery of delivering food and grass must naturally be left to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprises, Hudson was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the coalition logistics. This time there was no dispute. The command of the army can be independent, but the logistics must be unified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a matter of principle. If you don't appoint a responsible person, who will you ask for supplies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"On the wall is the map of the Orc Empire that we drew. The content is not very comprehensive, but it is already the limit of our understanding of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have no control over how to fight when the army sets out, but the transportation route of grain and grass must be planned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now please familiarize yourself with Duke Kavadia of the Orc Empire, and introduce us to the specific situation of the Orc Empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the internal meeting of the Allied Logistics Department, Hudson said with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's funny to think about it. In the absence of a unified command of the coalition forces, the logistics department, which seems to have little power, has actually become the only legal authority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics department, is there really no way to intervene in the front line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not believe that the coalition forces dared to fight all the way regardless of logistics. At most two or three hundred miles away, if it is farther away, it will not be able to take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the enemy sends troops to cut off the food road, the troops on the front line will be hungry. No commander would dare to take such a risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the grain and grass transportation route is determined, the attack direction of the army is also determined in essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone knows that the Orc Empire has many races and is ruled by the five royal families. In fact, their situation is far more complicated than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of terrain, the orc empire can be roughly divided into five parts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are: the orc prairie in the south, the Ula Mountains in the middle, the Nicholas Plateau in the north, the Salar Hills in the west, and the eastern coast is mostly undeveloped swamps and saline land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The complex terrain provides the best protection for the Orc Empire. In all the wars launched by the alliance against the orcs, the final battlefields have always been in the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The end point of most of the time, is where we are now. It's not that the predecessors didn't think about going deeper, the main problem is logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason why we can continue to fight this time is that Beitlun Port has been opened up, adding a sea transportation channel in addition to land transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this artificial port, the Kingdom spent ten years clearing up thousands of reefs and artificially opening up a sea channel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deceive the orcs, keep this hard-won port. Even when the war was most intense, we didn't activate it until the big counter-offensive started! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of this, Kavadia couldn't help but smile triumphantly. In this war, it was he who was personally responsible for guarding the port of Beitlun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous port development process, he also contributed a lot. The greater the role Beitlungang plays, the more he can prove his achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is with these solid achievements that he has established his position in the kingdom, and his prestige has surpassed the other four Dukes of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Duke, think of a way to capture the orc's Fengyue Port and use the sea channel to transport food and grass?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had no choice but to personally lead the team to participate in this war. The Warhammer Kingdom, whose vitality was severely damaged, fell into a mess after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King Joseph II's prestige plummeted, and he was unable to continue to maintain the balance of the kingdom. After the nobles of the western faction gained an advantage, they urgently needed to establish their prestige within the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a kingdom that has been ravaged by orcs to the point of paralysis, nothing can boost the morale of the people more than beating orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, internationally, they also need to brush up their presence to prove that they have also made contributions in this war against the invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old and vigorous Marshal Borg was invited out of the mountain by everyone. All parties barely got together 30,000 troops, and they appeared on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia replied with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was discussed in advance. Before the army set off, the trio had discussed in advance the route of dispatching troops and the transportation route of logistics materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan: part of the kingdom's army and allies share the task of transporting food, and the other part of the kingdom's army participates in the liquidation of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, the plan did not change quickly. In order to combat the prestige of the Kingdom of Alpha, the Holy See proposed at the alliance meeting that all the troops of the Kingdom would be incorporated into the logistics force, which was also recognized by all countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of arrangement, if you encounter a proud and arrogant master, you will have to explode on the spot. It's a pity that I met Hudson, who was beaten by the society, and went on the task directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the insult or not, the most important thing for the current Alpha Kingdom is to preserve its strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Responsible for escorting food and grass!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other troops are in danger, and it is unknown whether the allies will rescue them, but when the food transport team is in danger, no one dares to watch the show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many people in history who sell their teammates; those who dare to sell their own food delivery team are traitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, some people in the coalition army are secretly doing some small business with the orcs. To say that they betrayed the human race for the sake of the orc empire, there are not such stupid big forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Our northern continent has always lacked good ports, especially the east coast area is full of reefs, and the further north we go, the more serious it becomes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fengyue Port opened to navigation three years ago. It is said that the Beamon family spent a lot of money to open it up. Could it be that it was also created by your country? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not his fault for thinking this way, it's really a coincidence. It is reasonable for the Alpha Kingdom to forcibly open a port in the northern border area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the effect of external force, it has always been the landlubber Bimon, who wants to run to open up the port when he is full?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the development of Fengyue Port still failed. Ports did appear, but trade, as expected, did not flourish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, the Orc Empire lacked knowledge of navigation, and the level of shipbuilding was only slightly better than that of canoes. Building a ten-ton boat is the limit of their technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other hand, the harsh business environment of the Orc Empire has dissuaded countless businessmen with their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they are masters with clear hands and eyes, ordinary sea merchants would not dare to do business in the Beastman Empire, so that Fengyue Port has been in a state of depression since its opening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this is just a coincidence. The opening of Fengyue Port is completely whimsical by the old Bimeng Emperor, trying to seize wealth from the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the current situation of Fengyue Port, we can see that the orcs obviously lack knowledge in the field of port construction. Otherwise, as the largest port of an empire, it is impossible not to prosper! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson denied it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you open up a port on your own territory, and no one will say anything about the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Helping the orc empire open up a port is absolutely unacceptable. Even deep down, Hudson thought it was a good thing for his king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that he had made a slip of the tongue, Marshal Borg smiled apologetically. It's fine to do this kind of thing secretly, and it has to be publicly admitted, at least after the destruction of the orc empire, before it can be used as a meritorious promotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether to pull hatred, but politics has always been full of two sides, and everyone only pays attention to the final result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destroying the Orc Empire is a feat. If it fails to destroy the Orc Empire, but allows them to manage Fengyue Port and add a tax-heavy place, it will be a political accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc empire, the human coalition forces had just stepped out of the pass, and the news reached the five royal families. The five emperors were so frightened that they gathered together as quickly as possible to discuss countermeasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    coming!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The darkest hour of the Orc Empire is coming!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the **** revenge of the mainland overlord, no beast emperor dared to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The migration work is not going very smoothly. Many mountain tribes are unwilling to migrate to the grasslands to settle down. It may be that they leaked the news in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there are too many orcs who have failed in the southern invasion, even if we want to silence them, we can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the human race are coming fiercely, and there are not enough tribes responsible for blocking the sword. We must move more orcs to the past, slow down their attack speed as much as possible, and prepare for the withdrawal of the tribe! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The richest part of the Orc Empire is the Orc Grassland in Yimapingchuan, with lush water and grass and rich products, which is very suitable for the development of animal husbandry and agricultural production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the land in other regions is much poorer. Needless to say, the mountains in the central region rely entirely on hunting and picking wild fruits for their livelihoods, and can only support a small number of small and medium-sized tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plateau in the north is full of loess. It is dry and rainless all year round, and it is extremely cold in winter. Only some cold-resistant races can survive for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hilly land in the west is barren and limited by the productivity of the orc empire, so the current level of development and utilization is very low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eastern coast is full of swamps and saline-alkali land. With the productivity of the orc empire, it is natural that they have not been developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the large tribes of the orc empire basically gathered on the southern prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agricultural production has also developed in areas along the river and along the river. Although the output cannot be compared with that of the human race, it has also entered the era of farming civilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is because of these crops that the orc empire can feed a large population. If you abandon the rich prairie and move to other areas with poor land, everyone's good days will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make room for themselves, and to stop the attacking pace of the human army, the five royal families initiated a large-scale migration of races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The majestic Tyrannosaurus Rex, the sensitive yet mighty Velociraptor, the Earthrunner that weighed as much as an elephant... really blinded his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to running on the ground, there are also flying in the sky. In short, Hudson is so greedy for the property brought out by the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aside from these behemoth legions, the quality of individual soldiers of the coalition army is also frighteningly high, and there are almost no ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they knew it, everyone used these to support the scene. That also made Hudson drool enviously, and had to forcefully move his eyes away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't dare to continue watching, otherwise Hudson worried that he would be jealous and lose himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After watching the large troops leave, Hudson, who came back to his senses, realized his gaffe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone's reaction was similar to his. Every aristocrat has a dream of commanding thousands of troops, as a high-level aristocrat, he has to add two words after this-elite!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Now start assigning their respective tasks: Marquis James, you will be responsible for the distribution of food and grass for the army. It is necessary to do a good job in coordination and ensure that the supplies are distributed on time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg, Earl Martins, Earl Pierce, Duke Pias...you are in charge of escorting supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the coalition air force will provide you with safety warnings, this is the orc empire after all, and it is possible for the enemy to bypass the air force's sight to conduct military mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone must be vigilant, and don't give the enemy a chance to take advantage of it. In particular, beware of the enemy sending masters to engage in some means of offering sacrifices to evil gods on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dukes of Cavadia, Agieron, Dias, Ferdinand... Your mission is the most important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only must we take Fengyue Port, but we must also take Fengyue Port that can guarantee navigation, laying the foundation for the army's next attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of tasks are assigned, that is, everyone has work to do, and Hudson is left as an \"idle person\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is only a superficial phenomenon. As the commander-in-chief of the army, his task was not easy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sit in the central army and coordinate the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no problems, everything will be fine. If any accident occurs in any link, he has to be responsible for the aftermath to avoid further deterioration of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, the impatient Duke Pias jumped out and asked, \"Earl Hudson, why am I... in charge of transporting food and grass instead of attacking Fengyue Port?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to say that the nobles of the North were going to attack Fengyue Port, so why did they treat him separately. It's just that when the words came to his lips, he changed his words temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is already reckless enough to fire at Hudson, the coach. If you bring your colleagues along, you will offend many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A discerning eye can see it at a glance. It seems that they are all tasks, and there are also grades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make contacts and not be afraid of the trouble of dealing with interpersonal relationships, the best place to go is to distribute supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to gain military exploits, it is obviously more reliable to attack Fengyue Port. After all, the military exploits are all made by fighting, so where is the credit if you don't go out and kill people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Escorting food and grass, that can only be regarded as hard work. Unless the enemy robs food and successfully defeats the enemy, keeping the food and grass for the army, it can be regarded as a military exploit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of air force support in the sky, the probability of being attacked by a large enemy force is infinitely zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing that as soon as they acted, the nearby coalition forces immediately rushed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance launched this war not only to save the face of the Terran, but also to show off its muscles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only a show of strength to the foreign races outside, but also a competition between the major forces within the human race, or to deter each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt about the enthusiasm for combat. As long as it is a war that can be won, everyone will actively participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the coalition forces in front, even if the orcs come out to rob food, there is a high probability that they will only send a small group of troops to run over to cause damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie of Yimapingchuan, there are at most eight hundred people, and if there are more, they will not be able to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marching on the grassland, there are often more than one route to choose from. In the absence of prior intelligence, to complete the ambush accurately, it depends purely on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After gearing up and preparing for so long, when it came time to make contributions, he was put on little shoes. The Duke of Pias didn't challenge Hudson to a duel, which was considered a face for the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is no distinction between military tasks, but the division of labor is different. We are all fighting for the great cause of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking Fengyue Port is very important, and the task of escorting food and grass is equally important. Especially transporting food and grass on the land of orcs is even more dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are ordinary troops, which simply cannot meet the demand. Especially some high-risk delivery missions on special routes require you, the pillar of the kingdom, to take on this important task! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson retorted righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put the small shoes naked on the bright side, and make them look so grand that Duke Pias almost vomited blood from anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's reasons are still very good, and he blocked all the words he had prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was also surprised that the gentle and elegant coach of his own family was so ruthless in tricking people. For a moment, everyone looked at Duke Pias with sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sympathy is sympathy, and it is impossible to stand up and help. Someone had to do the dirty work, and either Duke Pias was unlucky or one of them filled the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially Earl Pierce, who was on the edge, turned pale with fright. As a potential competitor, what if he was given a death mission?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this worry only lasted for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the five major families in the north being dominant and the rest of the nobles being their vassals, the southeastern province is still full of nobles of all sizes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prosperous Koslow family is full of relatives and friends in the province. Hudson had reason to attack the Dalton family, but he couldn't catch the nobles of the entire province together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arranging the army of the Lochnard family to deliver food and grass, which cut off their way to gain military merit; but arranging the coalition forces of the nobles in the southeastern provinces to deliver tasks is a real care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation of success is strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the fragmented broken soldiers and the military power of the vassal nobles, Duke Pias still has more than 15,000 elites in his hands, who can go to the battlefield to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition of nobles in the southeastern provinces under the command of Earl Pierce has only more than 3,500 people in total, and they cannot afford to lose at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are avenging yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came out, Duke Pias regretted it. Being worn with small shoes, at most, will lose the chance of gaining military merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the dangerous mission Hudson said, that is only a relative term. As a commander, as long as his brain is not bad, he will not deliberately send the troops under his command to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles in the kingdom are watching. If there is a problem with Hudson's military deployment, he will not be able to convince the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge is very important, but this kind of play that hurts both sides is obviously not the work of a wise man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't pierce the window paper, even for your own reputation, Hudson will hide them in the snow at best. It is impossible to really assign dangerous tasks to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Pias, what you said is not nonsense. You and I have no grievances in the past, and we have no grievances in recent days. How can we publicly avenge our personal hatred?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulty What kind of unscrupulous things did you do behind your back, and you secretly made enemies with me? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grievances between the Koslow family and the Lochnard family are all old accounts from a hundred years ago. No one can tell the specific details now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the orc army that destroyed the Koslow family. The Lochnard family only contributed to the flames secretly, so they decided to die rather than save. On the surface, the two did not directly engage in action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the betrayal of the Koslow family, the Lochnard family also destroyed all the evidence, and never admitted it to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The well-known truth couldn't come out of his mouth, and Duke Pias blushed all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson calm down, Pias is just talking nonsense and has never been in contact with him. How can there be any personal enmity between you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If not everyone present was an insider, maybe they would have believed it. But it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not, in short, there must be no hatred between Pias and Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the unspeakable secrets of the Locknard family, Hudson sent troops to meet Duke Pias in time during the previous war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this kind of cooperation has no real meaning, the agreement between them and the orcs cannot be exposed, and they can only accept this favor on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitated for a while, and finally Duke Pias took a step forward and said: \"Sorry, respected Earl Hudson. Please forgive my gaffe just now...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Face cannot be taken for granted. Confronting the coach head-on without sufficient reason is a taboo in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, Your Excellency the Duke is eager for meritorious service, I can fully understand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unwilling to take on the task of transporting food, there is another combat mission here. It was originally planned to be completed by my troops and horses. Since Duke Pias needs it, I will leave it to Your Excellency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before attacking Fengyue Port, we still need a force to go there to create chaos and attract the main force of the enemy to ensure that the port will not be destroyed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The melon-eating crowd who were watching the excitement opened their eyes wide at this moment, looking at Duke Pias playfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want a combat mission, and this time I really have it. It is also attacking Fengyue Port, the only difference is that he wants to play a forward to attract the enemy's firepower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are definitely risks, but it is definitely not counted as death. It's not a decisive battle with the enemy in the past, it's just to attract the enemy out, the test is the general's command ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wanted to refuse, but Duke Pias couldn't say anything when the words came to his lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By this time, if he still doesn't understand that Hudson has tricked him, he will have spent so many years in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the prior communication with the Duke of Kavadia, there was no such task at all. This means that this military mission is completely tailor-made for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I hadn't made a fuss just now, I guess nothing would happen in the future. Now that he has made such a fuss, he has become a forward of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he still couldn't refuse, not participating in the task of transporting food and grass, and it could be said that he wanted to go to the battlefield. If you refuse the striker mission again, it will appear too ignorant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military orders are like mountains, how can they be changed one after another. If I refuse at this moment, I am afraid that none of my allies will support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There is more awe and less intimacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be a general, one must first establish prestige, and this step cannot be avoided. If it weren't for the fact that there were many nobles in the army and the situation was too complicated, he wouldn't have waited half a year before launching it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Duke Pias lost his composure for a while, but in fact, this plan against him has been going on for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Hudson became the head of the Kingdom's army, he has been giving Duke Pias a signal to retaliate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waiting in the unknown is always the most anxious. He was ready to welcome him, but there was no movement for a long time. Duke Pias had already suffered a lot in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how determined a person is, his mentality will collapse after being tortured for more than half a year. It's just that Duke Pias didn't notice this kind of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the scene of the gaffe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no previous foreshadowing, Duke Pias, as a veteran politician, would not foolishly turn his face against the commander in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the performance of Duke Pias is not bad. Originally, Hudson wanted to create pressure and force him to do it first, but unfortunately he was not fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't make a principled mistake, so the hat of \"colluding with the orcs\" naturally couldn't be given away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the big crime of betraying the race, the remaining little tricks can't shake the foundation of a big noble at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighing secretly, Hudson got busy again. Duke Pias jumped into the pit, but the final result is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson is no longer the little noble who led the charge. If he really wanted to go to battle to kill the enemy himself, then the time would be when the army would be defeated like a mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This military deployment, he really hopes to succeed. Not to mention the destruction of the orc empire, as long as they are expelled from the rich orc prairie, that is a great strategic victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the fertile prairie, even if the remaining land of the orc empire is still vast, it cannot support an empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even without the suppression of the five royal families, the rise of the remaining powerful races would still be limited by insufficient resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the threat of northern Xinjiang gone, it only makes sense to go north to recover the ancestral land. If they are harassed by orcs every three days, what's the use of such a bad place?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, the news of the coalition expedition came, and Caesar III was in a state of sorrow and joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war started according to his will, but what happened at the coalition meeting made him feel humiliated again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When did the Alpha Kingdom become unavailable and could only deliver food to the army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he couldn't accuse him of anything, Hudson didn't argue with reason, it was due to the lack of strength of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slapping a swollen face to pretend to be fat is to save face and suffer. With the current military strength of the Alpha Kingdom, there is no confidence to fight for face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really ran to compete with the major forces for the main attack task, he might have to pay for the last family fortune of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the supply of materials on the front line sufficient?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are about logistics. Compared with the orc empire, which has been severely damaged, the Terran Alliance has an absolute advantage. The only shortcoming restricting the performance of the Terran Alliance now is the logistics of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured. In the past six months, we have been paying close attention to logistical issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the front line of Zijingguan, we have stockpiled enough supplies for the army to use for half a year, and the supplies from the rear are still being sent to the front line continuously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the prior plan is completed, even if the war ends in a stalemate in the center of the orc prairie, we can still guarantee the logistics supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a problem with logistics, it will be after the orcs are driven out of the prairie. If this step can be achieved, the orcs will be nothing to worry about! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the founding of the country to the present, this is the first time that the Human Race Alliance has made up its mind to deal a ruthless blow to the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the alliance's plan goes well, the action against the orcs is just the beginning, and similar means will be used to defeat other surrounding alien races one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been the overlord of the mainland for so many years, the major forces of the human race are no longer satisfied with being the overlord of the mainland in name, but are preparing to unify the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. After countless years of development, many areas of the human race are overcrowded. If you don't want to cause internal conflicts, you can only expand externally and grab more survival resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding the legendary factors of the 100,000-year catastrophe stimulated the determination of the top leaders of the human race to do something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This top secret of the human race, except for the most powerful people in the mainland, knows that everyone else is a **** on the chessboard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In previous wars with orcs, most of them were forced to withdraw because of unresolvable logistical problems. I hope this time will be an exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, all the strategic materials of the Kingdom will be given priority to the front line, and if there is not enough, they will go overseas to purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's take the lead together. Recently, we have had a hard time together for a few days, giving up all the important supplies such as sugar and meat products used in daily life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let me set an example first. From today onwards, the palace will no longer supply sugar, wine, and cloth, and the supply of meat products will be reduced by 90%...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to cut other people's food standards, but it is really ruthless to take the lead in reducing living standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, kings and nobles took the lead in living a hard life, and there are many precedents in the Alpha Kingdom. Whenever the war enters a critical moment, in order to ensure the supply of materials on the front line, such a wave will come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as half a year ago, Caesar III played like this once. The days of continuous vegetarian diet almost made him starve to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war zone eased and the supply of supplies became abundant, normal life resumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, Caesar III learned to be smart. He didn't foolishly announce the complete cut off of meat supply, but only reduced the supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured. For the sake of the kingdom's future, it is nothing at all for me to suffer a little bit!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if they had rehearsed, everyone replied almost in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to contradict, the ancestors have come here. From the outbreak of the Great War to the present, except for a few celebration banquets, all the banquets in the kingdom disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be just advocacy, but it is actually enforced. It's just that this kind of coercion is not a legal means, but an unspoken rule common in the noble world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the social atmosphere is thrifty, extravagance and waste is a sin and will be despised by the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic gentlemen have taken the lead in saving, and other classes needless to say. Anyone who dares to commit a crime against the wind is looking for excitement for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything serves the war, and any behavior that contradicts this article will pay a heavy price for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By Xueyue Lake, looking at the clear lake water, Hudson, who revisited his hometown, felt very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to set up a temporary camp here, build a granary on the spot to stockpile supplies, and wait for the enemies in front to be cleaned up before moving forward!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Millions of troops are marching, and it is naturally impossible to **** food and grass all at once. That kind of large-scale material transportation is not economical at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rational choice is to continuously build temporary transfer stations along the way, hoard strategic materials along the way, and continue to re-ship materials according to actual needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xueyue Lake is one of the transfer stations selected by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, but the geographical location is good, and there are three natural rivers available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the water flow is not large, a small boat of more than ten tons can still navigate freely. It is not enough to meet the needs of the army, but the transportation pressure can be reduced by every point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all scouted in advance, and even the ships were brought over with the army. The only regret is: the direction of the army's departure now is upstream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, most of the water flow along the way is relatively gentle, and the river can be rowed forward. The river that needs to be pulled by manpower is not very long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Xueyue Lake, which was originally luxuriant in water and grass, was also a gathering area for orc tribes. It has a unique grassland market, which is a rare prosperous area in the orc empire, but it was patronized by the Northern Expedition Army half a year ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if she escaped by luck, she did not escape the fate of being forcibly recruited by the five royal families and being used as cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc tribes living in this area are all migrated by the five royal families after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of fertile land is obviously not something that everyone can own. If virtue does not match, one will suffer disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of unlucky tribes who migrated from the north and west, just lived a good life for a few days, and ushered in the attack of the human coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific battle scene, Hudson was not able to witness it.

The army cannot stay by the lake forever!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the order was issued to set up camp by the lake to establish a logistics transfer station, a group of northern nobles in the army hurried over to persuade them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing everyone's terrified expressions, Hudson knew there must be a story behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many \"forbidden places\" on the continent of Aslant, but horror is also relative. Many threats are aimed at ordinary people, and there are very few perverts who can threaten tens of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected by the kingdom's officials, the three major dangers of the orc empire are the northern plateau, the western Salar hills, and the Ural mountains in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xueyue Lake is not mentioned in the data at all. He really couldn't think of any danger here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, what horror is in this lake that makes you so afraid?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old enemy who has been entangled for many years, the Alpha Kingdom should have a better understanding of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xueyue Lake covers an area of ​​thousands of square kilometers. If there is a threat to the existence of the army, it should not be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we don't know exactly how dangerous Xueyue Lake is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I went deep into the orc empire to investigate intelligence, I accidentally heard an anecdote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to ancient legend, Xueyue Lake is the place where the gods fell. There is a curse in the lake. Various accidents will happen to the tribes who have lived here for a long time, and then they will decline rapidly until they perish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't have specific evidence in our hands, but the tribes directly under the five royal families have tacitly abandoned Xueyue Lake, which is luxuriant in water and grass and suitable for agricultural production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc tribes living nearby are all small tribes that can't get along with the outside world, so they have to come and settle down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, their tribes were as far away from the lake as possible, at least thirty miles away from the nearest tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every year, these tribes will move to live by the lake only when there is a shortage of crops. Once you're over it, leave immediately! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Baron Kettley's words, Hudson's expression suddenly became serious. The ancient myths and legends may not be true, but the choice of the native orcs cannot be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, a piece of fertile soil that was supposed to be robbed turned out to be a dangerous place that everyone can't avoid. It is impossible to have no problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson's dissatisfaction with the five Dukes of the North suddenly rose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern nobles under my command have only gone deep into the orc empire to do business a few times, and they all know that there is a problem with Xueyue Lake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But among the information provided to him, there is only one sentence about Xueyue Lake: the land is fertile and the water is luxuriant. It was clearly digging a hole for him on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The convenience of water transportation, Hudson does not want to give up. But the danger that may exist in the lake cannot be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the noble children of the northern lands, Hudson asked with concern: \"Is there any more specific information about Xueyue Lake, including folklore?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there are many legends about Xueyue Lake, which can be divided into three categories: water monsters, evil gods, and curses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that if you live here for a long time, you will be contaminated with the unknown in the lake. When I was on a mission here three years ago, I encountered a small tribe that was wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of curiosity, we examined the body carefully, but found no injuries. There are no traces of hands, the only thing that is wrong is that there is some dust on the freshly dead body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After realizing something was wrong, we left quickly. And secretly asked the local orcs, it is said that this kind of thing happens every few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the victims were members of tribes living nearby. Some people died in the wild, others died at home. The manner of death was similar, and no wounds could be found on the bodies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people say that the water monster is killing them, others say that it is the evil gods, and more people think that there are ominous things in the lake, and if they are contaminated, they will be cursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the imperial court of the orcs also sent experts to check it out, but we don't know what happened in the end. Anyway, no tribe from the five major royal families came to settle here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Orc Empire, Xueyue Lake has another name—Devil Lake. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Reno replied with a little panic, as if awakening the terror deep in his heart, and confused Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he still keenly caught a message—there was dust on the corpse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, whether it is an evil god, a water monster, or a curse to kill someone, they are all taken away neatly, without creating a pile of dust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crater Lake!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, these three words popped out of Hudson's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the memory before crossing, there was a message about you about Crater Lake, which happened to be similar to the situation of Xueyue Lake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever a volcano erupts, it will release a large amount of harmful gas and dust, which ordinary people simply cannot resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For orcs who lack knowledge reserves, it is normal to guess blindly when encountering unknown things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to move the camp 30 miles upstream along the Green Jade River. Send people to the lake to investigate to see if there is a crater.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth can be found slowly, but the source of danger must be kept away. In case of bad luck and a volcanic eruption, the army will have to suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the judgment is wrong, it will be even more terrifying. Unknown dangers are far more terrifying than known risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the crystal clear lake water and the schools of fish shuttling back and forth, Hudson always felt something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal circumstances, there should be no fish in the volcanic lake, and the surrounding environment should not be so comfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is a different world, and the rules of the world's operation are also very different. The theoretical knowledge before time travel may not be correct here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, a human army suddenly broke away from the main force and headed towards the coastal area that deviated from the direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the map, leading the team to **** forward, Duke Pias's nerves were tense all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the vanguard of the army, the military tasks and risks he undertakes are the highest in the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although according to the news from the flying dragon cavalry, the orcs did not deploy heavy troops in the coastal area, and there were only some small and medium tribes entrenched along the way, he was still worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who let the news come from the Holy See? If the Kingdom's air force hadn't been severely damaged, he would definitely not have panicked at the news from his own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, Bishop Simon of the Holy See is here to visit.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the guard said made Duke Pias slightly taken aback. Immediately after reacting, he hurriedly ordered: \"Please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the Holy See is not harmonious, but now is the period of joint operations. In theory, the two sides should settle their differences and help each other together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If at any other time, people from the Holy See came to visit with such great fanfare, Duke Pias would have to consider avoiding suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, how are you thinking?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Locknard family, the current situation is not very good. Caesar III has long since eliminated you, but he has not been able to find a chance to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't thought about you, he would not have appointed Earl Hudson, who has a blood feud with you, to come over as the commander of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether this is easy to deal with, your Excellency has already experienced it. Being a pioneer is just the beginning, and there will be more annoying tasks waiting for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson is best at boiling frogs in warm water. If it takes too long, the Lochnard family will suffer a lot! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon tried his best to provoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inevitable that Caesar III had opinions on the nobles of the North, but it would be an exaggeration to say that they should be eliminated quickly. Even if you really want to do it, it can't be now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the military power of the Alpha Kingdom greatly damaged, no matter which faction it is in the country, they dare not provoke internal fighting at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the last family property is lost and foreign enemies are peeped, then it will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The Holy See, which has been eyeing the Alpha Kingdom for a long time, has been looking for an opportunity to interfere in the Kingdom's internal affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you have taken the matter too seriously. Your Majesty is wise and mighty, and will never do things that hurt loved ones and make enemies happy at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Earl of Hudson, do you think I'm afraid of him? So what if he is the commander of the coalition army, there are still so many nobles in the army watching!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, even if I promise to cooperate with you, it will have no effect. With the strength of the Lochnard family alone, they are simply unable to control the situation in the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias replied a little nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the great aristocracy, he is also a \"firm\" royalist, and has no good impression of the Holy See. However, the benefits promised by the Holy See were too great, which shook his will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the plan of the Holy See is completed, the Locknard family will be the most powerful family in the kingdom. In addition to being unable to ascend the throne directly, the power in his hands is not much less than that of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the success rate of the plan is not high enough. Even if the previous plans are successfully completed, it will be difficult to control the kingdom with the strength of the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if other families will object, but the newly rising Koslow family will definitely jump out and fight them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of comprehensive strength, the Locknard family is several times, or even ten times, that of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the game of the big family is not only based on the overall strength, but at extreme moments, the military strength in hand is more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the military strength of the two families is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in the past years, the Lochnard family has not only had one enemy left by the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They want to control the power of the kingdom, and the enemies who are driven into a hurry are entirely likely to take risks and join hands to give them a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, rules are only rules if everyone abides by them. You can't destroy it yourself, and expect others to continue to abide by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is no need to worry. Your family is not enough, so let's bring in a few more allies!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the Northland have been united for so many years, I think your Excellency must have a way to drag them into trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the power of your five major families, you can basically suppress the nobles in the south. If you can't do it, you can bring in a few more allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are stable enough and don't violate the core interests of the southern border nobles in the early stages of taking power, civil war will not break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency the Duke, think about it carefully, right now is the best opportunity. Once the guys in the south regained their strength, the situation will be very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of recovery speed, they are much faster than you. Once you let them recover first, it will be your end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things happen as they happen, and no one can undo them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon warned with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many broken things about the nobles in the North, and it is not surprising that they have a handle in the hands of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family's reputation is already bad, and Duke Pias doesn't mind exposing some dark history. What really worries him is that there will be no pie in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See kept saying that it would help them control the Alpha Kingdom. This spirit of selfless dedication really moved him too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Bishop Simon said, some things cannot be undone once they happen. Now what they have to do is—regicide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are not the protagonist, just creating opportunities for the people of the Holy See, that is killing the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For any orthodox nobleman, the inner impact is huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See can be indifferent. There are not only one or two kings who have been killed by them in history, and they don't care about the life and death of Caesar III at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Duke of Pias is different. The five major families in the Northland are connected with each other, and they are just a combination of interests. If it involves killing the king, he can't guarantee whether the other four will follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this kind of thing is exposed, it will be their end. Don't say that the enemies of the Lochnard family will not let them go, and even the vassal nobles under their command will have a high probability of fighting back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect the support of the Holy See to play much role. You must know that the collapse of the Holy See's rule back then was sending a king to the barbecue grill, which triggered a wave of anti-Holy See in the aristocratic world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really exposed, it will be too late for them to throw the blame, so how could they come out to carry the thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearing the charge of regicide, the Pope couldn't bear it either. This is a taboo that all monarchs cannot tolerate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as someone is willing to take the lead, everyone will definitely not mind forming a coalition army to attack the Holy See and pull out the danger on their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, now is not the time. Why don't you help us take Fengyue Port first and severely damage the Orc Empire?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the hidden dangers in the north are not cleared first, once the kingdom falls into chaos, the pressure on our family will be too great! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias tentatively proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing in cooperation is trust. As the weaker party, Duke Pias needs to consider more issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Holy See, as long as Caesar III died, most of the plan would be completed, but for the Lochnard family, it was just the beginning of a new trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to control the government, you can only infiltrate slowly, instead of just rushing in and becoming a powerful minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in the early stage, you have to be quiet, pretending that you have no preparations. Where there is a little overstepping, it is easy to be linked with the regicide case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, they were not prepared to cooperate with the five major families. After all, the strength gap between the two sides is huge, and they are not equal allies at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, killing the king is a technical job. Without the cooperation of internal personnel, the killer would not be able to touch Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The killer sent by the Holy See has been lurking in the capital for several years. None of them found an opportunity to get close to Caesar III, but lost a lot of manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, I can only find partners in the Alpha Kingdom. If it's anything else, it's easy to operate by bribery, but this time is an exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the friendship is on weekdays, as long as they show the slightest intention of killing the king, the other party will immediately turn against them without leaving any sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The thorn has not been removed for a long time because the thorn and the flesh have grown together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regicide is such a dangerous job, not many people dare to think about it, let alone take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the Holy See had something to do, and the Lochnard family and the royal family had too much grievances, he would definitely report it to the king as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, since the Holy See dared to conspire, the partners it was looking for were naturally having problems with Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't want to participate, you are happy to see Caesar III die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, as long as this kind of thing is not reported at the first time, it will only rot in the stomach later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Pias showed a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth. The gaze towards Xueyue Lake was also full of murderous intent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This mistake seems to be Hudson's deliberate plan, but in fact there is Caesar III behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battles, nobles from all over the kingdom suffered heavy losses, but the strength of the five major families in the North was relatively intact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the soldiers successfully evacuated by the Northern Expeditionary Army, the five major families accounted for half of them, which essentially broke the original balance of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the northern nobles can be suppressed now. That is because the major factions have united. In fact, the southern nobles are divided into multiple groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention whether they can unite, even if it can be done, Caesar III is unwilling to see this scene happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a lot of effort to dismantle the noble group. How could it be possible to tolerate the pressure from the nobles of the North to allow the nobles in other parts of the kingdom to unite again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in this war, the territory of the Alpha Kingdom expanded further north. If you don't take action to suppress it, it will be the northern nobles who will gain the most benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's attack on the Lochnard family was not only because of family grievances, but also because of the general situation in the country, with the support of the king and a group of southern Xinjiang nobles behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forces involved are too wide, and Hudson occupies the position of coach, so Duke Pias naturally cannot take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Northland noble group still launched a silent counterattack, and concealing the matter of Xueyue Lake was one of the measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter how many people are killed, anyway, the loss is heavy, and the Terran Alliance is responsible for the bottom line. The key is to pull Hudson off the horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no major emergency, according to Hudson's steady military deployment, it is impossible to be kicked out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of accident can only happen in the rear. After all, the only offensive mission of the Kingdom army, the army responsible for carrying out the mission is mainly the nobles of the Northland, and they cannot catch their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking up a letter with a pen, after the cronies finished sealing it, Duke Pias rushed to the head of the guard not far away and ordered: \"Paul, give this secret letter to Duke Kavadia!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that the Holy See wants to kill the king cannot be leaked. As nobles in the Northland, there are also differences of interest within them. Duke Pias can't guarantee that everyone is of one mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important task now is to take Fengyue Port and earn enough military exploits for the family. In order to take away enough cakes in the next carve-up feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether to take the risk of cooperating with the Holy See, Duke Pias has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything depends on whether the plan goes well. If Hudson can be taken down and replaced by one of his own people, the situation will be completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has taken the initiative and avoided the subsequent political suppression, so there is no need for him to go to extremes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now adopting the procrastination decision, it is Pias's innermost hope that the Holy See will not be able to bear it anymore, and find other forces in the country to join forces to help pull out the thorn in the flesh of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, there is a mysterious underground palace in the lake, which is full of altars, enshrining an idol with a human head and a snake body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the underground palace, we found countless white bones, as if there was a battle, but there were traces of man-made destruction at the scene. Perhaps the horror of Xueyue Lake originated from this mysterious palace! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson was taken aback. There is actually a mysterious underground palace on the island in the lake, so the previous speculation about the volcanic lake is probably false. Could it be that the horror really comes from the underground palace?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the sudden appearance of a **** with a human head and a snake body made Hudson even more puzzled. In his memory, he didn't know that there was such a **** in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, in the myths and legends of the previous life, there are many similar gods, and they are all over the mythology system of East and West.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon Hudson calmed down, and the inherent concept killed people. It is naturally impossible to build an underground palace in the volcanic lake in the previous life, but this is an extraordinary world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to keep the underground palace in the crater. Theoretically speaking, it is only necessary to arrange a magic circle to block the entrance of the volcano.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the energy consumption may be relatively large, especially when the volcano erupts, it is not so easy to press the magma back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the most indispensable thing among volcanoes is energy. If this power can be used to maintain the long-term operation of the magic circle, it is not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the guess is correct, then the previous encounter with the orc tribe would be easy to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic circle is not omnipotent. Its main task is to protect the underground palace. With the erosion of the years and the natural movement of the earth's crust, it is normal for a few small gaps to appear nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge volcanic eruption was suppressed by the magic circle. Some small gaps still have magma ejected from the lake, causing natural disasters in local areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the circumstances of lack of cognition, being mistaken by the orcs as a curse or evil god, that makes sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are fish in the lake, so it is better explained. In the continent of Aslant, there are creatures living in the high-temperature magma, not to mention lakes with slightly damaged water quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this lake is still a living lake. The natural purification ability is also leveraged. No matter how many harmful substances there are, they will quickly become invisible under the uncanny workmanship of nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson had the idea to find out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, is there no danger in this lake?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Ben Xiong has checked it himself, and there isn't even a monster inside. If there is any danger, the people you sent out will not come back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cub stretched, yawned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you sure I'm not in danger?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is dangerous or not is always relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An adult Earth Bear, even if he fell into the magma, he would take a hot bath. At most, the water temperature is too hot, making it uncomfortable to wash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not dangerous for Bear Stearns, but if Hudson goes there, I am afraid that there will be no bones left in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put up the magic shield, at most let him hold on for a few more seconds, so that he can know how he is walking towards death step by step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Be careful, you should be fine. It seems that there are a few evil guys sealed inside, but they have all become energy bodies and can't get out at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are lucky enough to break out, they will be even more unlucky if they meet you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what Bear Stearns said, Hudson instantly had a bottom line. Losing the energy body of the physical body, isn't that just giving him experience?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The compass in the body is a big energy devourer. No matter what evil **** it is, it is the food of the compass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, all the magic crystals and cores captured by the army entered the compass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Absorbed countless energies, the compass space is still empty, as if it will never be filled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evil gods who are terrified by the outside world are a great tonic when they come to Hudson, provided that they do not come in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go, let's go and see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson pulled Bear Stearns off his shoulders. Mounts are used at such critical moments. Compared with rafting, it is safer to ride a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fly slower!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of friction between the magic shield and air resistance was like thunder, and Hudson was so frightened that he hurriedly asked the cub to slow down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the most unscientific place on the continent of Aslante. Powerful monsters are hardly affected by air resistance, but people can't, or ordinary people can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened specifically, Hudson couldn't figure it out. Even after searching through the books in his hands, he couldn't find a definite answer. He could only attribute it to the privilege of the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or in other words, if the strength reaches a certain level, it will breed an ability in itself, which can greatly reduce the influence of air resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Here we go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Bear Stearns' reminder, Hudson slowly opened his eyes and looked at the unfamiliar island in the lake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area of ​​the island is very small, and the part above the water is only equivalent to the size of two football fields, which is not suitable for human habitation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the island, except for a few towering old trees, the ground is completely bare, as if it has been deliberately treated by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small area, it is no wonder that the entrance of the underground palace can be easily discovered, and it is clearly exposed to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he set foot on the island, Hudson realized that it was unusual. Vaguely, he felt the existence of enchantment on several ancient trees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With apprehension in mind, Hudson slowly stepped into the underground palace, and Hudson felt a unique pressure, and now he can play at most one or two points of 100% of his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, there was a voice that kept telling him: Don't shoot here! don't make a move here...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to remind him, his strength has been suppressed so badly, even if he had the guts, he would not dare to do anything in such a weird place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is also the reason why the underground palace can be preserved. After all, the strong always cherish their lives, and they have always kept a respectful distance from such unknown and mysterious places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going forward along the tunnel, one altar after another appeared in front of Hudson, and the surrounding walls were also covered with murals, the most eye-catching one was the idol with a human head and a snake body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion. Hudson always feels like he's seen that idol somewhere, but he just can't remember it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the murals on the surrounding walls, it seems to be telling about this war, but the protagonist of the war is not human beings, but legendary giants, dragons, demons, angels, monsters, undead...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my mind, I searched through the history books but couldn't find any records similar to this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is too little information in his hand, only the content on the mural, Hudson really doesn't know what is recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are written records around the murals, but it is a pity that Hudson's knowledge is limited, and he doesn't know these winding pictographs at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, have these words been passed down?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the short history of the rise of human beings, Warcraft has dominated the mainland for a longer time. Before the rise of various races, the earliest masters of the mainland were monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of the oldest race, the Earth Bear is definitely one of them. It's a pity that this race has a lot of power, but it doesn't have the intention to fight for hegemony on the mainland, and it's not even active in making bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the desire to reproduce is stronger, no matter how difficult it is to reproduce, you can become the second dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is a prehistoric text! It seems to be about the end of the era, when demons and angels invaded the mainland, and all races united to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the devil and the angel aren't rivals, how could they be united?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such war in the inheritance memory of Ben Xiong, either?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The picture clearly shows that the Earth Bear participated in the battle. If there are ancestors involved, this part of knowledge will definitely be recorded! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It really refreshes the view of Xiong Sheng!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there a possibility that demons and angels were not opposed in ancient times, but became mortal enemies only because of what happened later?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the vicissitudes of the murals, it can be determined that this underground palace has existed for countless years. The magic circle guarding the underground palace has been able to operate until now, and the owner of this place is definitely not easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for such a big man to make up a story to fool us younger generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all a thing before the last epoch, whether the content is true or not, it is no longer important now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for your inherited memory, it is even simpler. Either it was erased by someone, or the Earth Bears who participated in the battle all died on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recall carefully, is there an ancient war in your inheritance memory, and is there any information recorded in specific content. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson made up his mind directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he is not an aborigine, otherwise he would definitely be numb by the contents of the mural.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that there was indeed a war, but it is really far away from the current time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that in that era, there were no human races on the mainland? Even the Lord of Dawn and the God of Beasts have not risen yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these memories are very little, and they are just a simple mention, which should be deleted by the ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, our inheritance memory capacity is also limited. To add some content, it is necessary to delete some unnecessary things. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the confused bear eyes, Hudson wanted to laugh. Inheritance memory capacity is limited?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sounds right, but in fact, the inheritance memory of the Earth Bear family is far from the limit of their brain capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the last chat, Bear Stearns boasted that after he became the bear king, he would put the history of bear life into the inheritance memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to leave a legacy memory, the lowest threshold is the bear king. This is also the reason why Bear Stearns has a lot of common sense and lags behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the number of earth bears is too rare, and the probability of a bear king is really not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Xiong Sheng's growth process can be artistically processed and put into the inheritance memory for later Xiong to admire and learn from. Why delete the ancient inheritance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that this kind of ancient secret is useless in normal times, but once it comes in handy, it can save the bear's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Something must have happened behind this, causing the Earth Bear to give up this part of the inherited memory; or an external force intervened to forcibly erase this part of the memory of the Earth Bear family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    History has been reduced to memory, and the current Aslante continent is no longer a continent where even gods can swim freely. The rules of the world have changed, and there is simply no room for those superpowers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With doubts in his mind, he walked near the idol, and a seductive voice came from Hudson's ear: \"Break this statue, and I will give you supreme power and help you dominate the world!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounded like a big villain, making him seem like a fool, Hudson rolled his eyes directly\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It also \"gives supreme power to dominate the world\". If you really have this ability, you can just come out from under the statue. Why make it so complicated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who are you? Who sealed you here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretendingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he did not forget to distract and suppress the compass that was about to move in his body. There are not many opportunities to peep into the secrets of the ancient times. It is not too late to test a few words first, and then let the compass swallow them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all those damned demons, they used despicable means, paid the price of dying together, and sealed me here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Child, as long as you let me out, my great Lord of Light will make you the king of the world!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you smash this statue, the whole world is yours. Everything in the world lives for you and dies for you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do it, boy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Lord of Light finished speaking, Hudson replied: \"Okay, wait a moment!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally suppressed compass was suddenly released, and a huge attraction went straight to the Lord of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just spit out a single word, and the Lord of Light, who spoke so loudly, turned into a ball of pure energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled slightly. I don't know if it's because I've been sealed for too long, my brain is ruined, and I'm not professional enough to even make up nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evil demons paid the price of their lives to seal the light, which is simply nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many demons hiding on the mainland, Hudson has never heard of that demon willing to sacrifice his life to destroy the light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it was the strong men of all ethnic groups who made sacrifices one after another in order to seal the evil spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to ask a few more questions, but thinking of this evil god's mouth full of lies, even if he asked useful information, he couldn't believe it was true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it was a matter of countless years ago. Whether he knew it or not had little effect on him, so he simply dealt with the evil **** first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the era of the Lord of Dawn, even if he is really the Lord of Light, he will still be treated by the evil god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the increased energy bar in the compass, Hudson secretly sighed: This wave is not in vain! With the selfless dedication of this \"Lord of Light\", he is almost catching up with all his gains in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to leave, suddenly a phantom appeared on the idol, and when he opened his mouth, Hudson was frightened to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You finally came!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 293": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 293: bad check\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 293 Bad check\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's finally here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is he pretending to be a ghost, or did someone predict in advance that he would come here?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could ask, Xu Ying suddenly trembled and said frantically, \"You are not him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are not him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Repeating this sentence over and over again, can you still have a pleasant conversation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Senior, who is he you are talking about?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help interrupting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seemingly aware of his loss of composure, the phantom said unsteadily, \"He, that's him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's him, and it's not him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Xuying's nonsensical words, Hudson was completely confused. He doesn't study philosophy, so \"it's him, it's not him, it's really blinding Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But reason told him that there was no need to argue with a wisp of remnant soul. Especially in this kind of mysterious palace, it is very risky to go against the master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I didn't expect it to be the end of the era in a flash, and a hundred thousand years have passed by like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the current world rules are much more stable than those of ancient times, and there should not be so many terrifying monsters coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Boy, it's almost time for a big purge again. If you don't want to die, get stronger quickly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alright, it's time for you to leave. Don't disturb my slumber unless he really returns! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, a man and a bear appeared on the lake. Fortunately, Hudson reacted quickly enough to catch Bear Stearns' bear hair in time, otherwise he would fall into the lake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turned his attention to the island in the lake again. The original island was sinking rapidly, and several ancient trees suddenly came alive, turning into treant guards and rushing into the underground palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the tumbling lake water, only one person and one bear were left on the lake, staring at each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson only has in his mind: \"The end of the era, monsters, and cleansing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to ask for more information, but thinking of what happened just now, he really didn't dare to take the risk of disturbing the owner of the underground palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There have always been legends of catastrophe on the continent of Aslante. After each catastrophe broke out, the civilization of the continent would retreat significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many continental overlords have been reduced to sacrifices of catastrophe, and have since turned from prosperity to decline, and gradually declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that a hundred thousand years are approaching, deep down in his heart, Hudson has long guessed that this time will be unusual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be \"cleaned up\", which is too scary. A cleansing of all the races on the mainland might cause countless races to disappear in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are probably very few races that survived the last major cleansing safely. As for the races that appeared later, it was more like a restart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is a native or an alien species, no one can tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is hidden behind this, Hudson can't even imagine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the fault of luck. If he traveled a few hundred years earlier or a few hundred years later, he wouldn't bother to worry about these problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened to be at this juncture, so I had to face it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is that the big cleansing does not mean death. There are also many races that have survived, and they are even alive and well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, is there any information about the Great Cleansing in your inheritance memory?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the murals, it can be seen that the Earth Bear family also survived the last catastrophe. Such an important message, if there is no accident, the ancestors will definitely leave a legacy memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I mentioned a sentence: Great Cleansing—Dangerous! I don't know which irresponsible bear it is. I don't know such important information. Please record it in detail!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Bear Stearns' complaint, Hudson shook his head secretly. Perhaps this is not irresponsibility, but involuntary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, it was not in vain to come out this time. Not to mention adding some energy, I also accidentally peeked out a hint of information about the Hundred Thousand Calamities from the prehistoric ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although you don't know what the enemy you need to face, it is better to prepare in advance than to be unprepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back in the barracks, Hudson's mind returned to the battlefield again. As the general manager of logistics, he needs to deal with daily affairs, which is quite a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Duke of Cavadia led the troops to the expedition, and the Marquis of James was coordinating with the major forces on the front line. There was no third deputy commander to share the deployment work in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decentralization of power to the nobles below again, Hudson dared to think about it, but unfortunately he didn't dare to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the name is not correct, the words will not go well. Without the appointment of the kingdom, Hudson appointed a person in charge, but there was no way to convince the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case something goes wrong accidentally, he, the coach, will be the first to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the progress of the various armies, Hudson quickly realized that something was wrong. The resistance of the orcs was much weaker than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, almost all the people who come out to fight the coalition forces are local tribes, or orc tribes that have been relocated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armies of the five major royal families played very few battles. Every time they made a move, they were as fast as lightning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for some small forces that were grouped together and suffered a lot of losses on the battlefield due to insufficient cooperation, the large forces were hardly damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cursing the orcs as \"counsels\", Hudson had to admit that the orc empire also had strategists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is: every mile the orcs retreat, the logistics of the coalition forces are stretched by a mile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc tribes along the way have pitifully low productivity. Even if they were all taken away, it would be difficult to provide much supplies to the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the harder the coalition forces kill, the happier the enemy will be. The loss of a large number of vassal tribes seemed to have weakened the strength of the orc empire, but it also eliminated the hidden dangers of the rule of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of the human coalition forces, the remaining orc tribes, no matter how reluctant they are, can only bite the bullet and join hands with the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy wants to exchange space for time. This is a blatant conspiracy. Even if he sees it, Hudson can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the orcs respond, this war must continue. Without a bright enough record, the Terran Alliance can't close the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where is the army of Duke Pias?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the front line, Duke Pias, who attacked Fengyue Harbor by surprise, asked angrily, \"What's going on?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't the people in the Holy See say that the main force of the orcs had withdrawn?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why is there so many enemies stationed in an unimportant port? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asked three times in a row, but no one could answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is stronger than expected, and the task of attracting the enemy has been successfully completed. The only problem is: the enemy is too strong, and he was caught and beat up by the vanguard as soon as he came out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to inform the Duke of Kavadia, we need reinforcements!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reacting from the brief panic, Duke Pias ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to retreat. To retreat at this time is to leave the back to the enemy, which can easily lead to a big rout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most effective measure is to line up to meet the enemy and stand by for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, thick smoke billowed in front of him, hurting the eyes of Duke Pias, and Fengyue Port was on fire!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is destroying Fengyue Port!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, there is nothing Pias can do now. From the start of the surprise attack failure, it meant that he lost the initiative on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a moment, he thought of \"Holy See\". This mission was still relatively secretive, and it was not notified to allies other than the kingdom army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that there has always been a secret relationship between the nobles of the North and the Holy See. In order to make the operation smoother, Duke Pias asked the Holy See for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the kingdom, except for the nobles in the North who must have contact with the orcs because of their interests, and the nobles in other regions can't participate in the smuggling trade, naturally they will not be overwhelmed and go to establish contact with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to leak the news, it is difficult to pass the information to the top orcs in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This action was a surprise attack. Now that an accident happened, the first object of suspicion of Duke Pias was the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost instantly, Duke Pias understood that this was caused by the fruitless communication with Bishop Simon last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The word \"drag\" made the Holy See realize that only by pushing them to a dead end can the two sides cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fengyue Port was burned down, it was just a trivial matter. The key is that the enemy destroys ports and waterways, and that is fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to repair the port, not to mention the waste of time and money, the key is that it takes a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the strategic value of the port cannot be brought into play, and the combat achievements of this operation will be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For other northern nobles, they lost a share of military exploits, at most, they lost a piece of cake when they divided up the feast after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias is different, the current coach is his family's sworn enemy. If he failed to capture Fengyuegang's hat intact, there is a high probability that it will be pinned on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect someone to help you speak up. Someone has to take responsibility for strategic failures. Either he will bear it, or all the northern nobles will bear it together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such an extra crime on his head, when the spoils are divided up after the war, the Lochnard family can be kicked out logically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realized this, it was too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When making cakes, people think there are too few people; when sharing cakes, people think there are too many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good choice for all parties to be able to kick out a family to share the cake. You can't expect that everyone will sacrifice their own interests to give them a hand?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the friendship is, it's useless. Lochnard is not at the end of his rope. It's just that he missed a chance to share the cake, but it can't arouse everyone's sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After cursing angrily, Duke Pias had no choice but to swallow the rest of the words back into his stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the Holy See involves the conspiracy of \"regicide\", so you can't talk about it with your subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But deep down in his heart, he has already greeted the whole family of the Holy See. It's so deceitful, to force him to go into the water for the La Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more this happened, the more uncertain Duke Pias was. The main reason is that the ally of the Holy See is too cheated. If you cooperate with them, you will be cheated to death if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much the king suppresses the Lochnard family, they are still a big family in the kingdom. At most, it is difficult to develop and grow, and it has not reached the point of death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once word of the \"regicide\" gets out, no matter what the final success or failure, the aristocratic group will not tolerate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family has a big business, and it is really difficult for him to make up his mind to participate in this high-risk, high-yield gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, seeing the continuous battle reports from the front line, the five emperors are also under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We can't go on like this. The enemy's attack speed is too fast, and it will take time for the tribe to transfer. We must hold them back first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any strategy requires a price. Ordinary orc tribes give up, so they give up, but their own people can't give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the five royal families, the Beamon family has the least pressure on the transfer of tribes. Because of the sparse population, the evacuation was completed first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Followed by the Eagle family. Although they carried a lot of property and couldn't fly away, their population was not large, and they were almost transferred now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining three tribes will be tragic. It is no fun to organize the migration of millions of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even as early as half a year ago, the implementation has already started. Up to now, the tribes that have completed the evacuation are still less than half of the total population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current evacuation speed, they will have to struggle for at least another year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't be faster, the long-distance trek will cause a lot of losses, if you speed up, few of the cubs in the tribe will be able to reach their destination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the human coalition forces are coming fiercely, and the tribes along the way are useless, and there is no way to buy them enough time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We have already destroyed Fengyue Port, and temporarily cut off the enemy's idea of ​​transporting food by sea, so we should be able to delay their marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's hard to say. With the strength of the human race, it would not be difficult to restore the port if a group of high-level magicians were gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only two ways to delay the enemy's progress without a decisive battle with the enemy:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either organize troops and attack their army continuously along the way, directly delaying their marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either arrange manpower to go deep into the enemy's rear to wreak havoc and hinder their grain transportation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Behemoth family has completed their evacuation, but the current orc empire needs to help each other. Without the support of allies, they would not be able to stand up to the allied forces of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Bimon, aren't we already working on these two plans?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all done, but the effect is not very good. Perhaps because of lack of experience, or perhaps because of lack of strength, the teams sent out to cause sabotage basically never return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people to attack the army, always love to be bitten by the enemy, and can only bully the weaker teams in the coalition army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sneak attack on grain and grass is even more tragic. Most of the troops didn't even find the grain transportation team, but they were found by the enemy in the sky and ushered in the encirclement and suppression of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very few teams have completed the latent work. Unfortunately, the route of the enemy's food transportation team is not fixed. In many cases, there is no trace of the enemy for many days in ambush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by insufficient intelligence. After losing the air superiority, the orc army was restrained everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't look at me like that, the Ying people have done their best. Protecting the safety of our heads is already the limit. We don't have the strength to go deep behind the enemy lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is the overlord of the mainland. If our Yingren clan alone can suppress their air power, why should the human race dominate the mainland? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingren Huang stared back unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to be ashamed of, they can't beat the human race in the air; the other four races can't beat the human race on the ground either. They are all losers, so don't laugh at anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't mean to sneak attack on the prairie, but to send a small group of troops to go deep into the Alpha Kingdom to carry out a sneak attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can see that the enemy is protecting the grain road to death. There is no opportunity to take advantage of, even if it succeeds occasionally, it will not have much effect on the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real weak point of the enemy is their rear. The troops of the Alpha Kingdom are all on the front line, and the domestic grain transportation team has almost no defensive force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our people sneak in, even a few dozen elite soldiers can destroy a grain transportation team!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the stakes are high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to destroy the enemy's heartland, each team should not have too many people, everything can only be done by yourself, and you can't be bitten by the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex slowly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this is not a good choice. Now sending troops deep into the enemy's rear, basically there is no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the current Orc Empire, sending death squads deep into the Alpha Kingdom to do things has become their only choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the dispatched team can come back, as long as there is trouble in the rear, it can affect the enemy's logistical supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Disaster!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy hoarded a lot of food and grass along the way, and sent people to make trouble. If they want to affect the front line, it will take a few months at the earliest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short time, we have to find a way to entangle with the coalition forces. Unless a sneak attack can be organized to take away the enemy's grain and grass transfer station on the grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is almost impossible. According to the information we have collected, it is the Earl of Hudson who is currently in charge of the delivery of food and grass in the enemy army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is familiar with this person. The use of soldiers is the most insidious and cunning, and it is not easy to exploit his loopholes! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can you be unfamiliar, mentioning Hudson Beamon Emperor and Xiongren Emperor, almost exploded on the spot. The faces of the other emperors were also ugly, as if they wanted to swallow Hudson alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter how difficult it is, we must try it! If the plan fails, we can only call a large army to fight the enemy, and rely on large-scale battles to delay time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the success or failure of the war, we will suffer a lot. We can't win the human race by fighting consumption. Even if all the enemy troops on the grassland are wiped out, more enemy troops will come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last solution is to retreat all the way and continue to lengthen their front, so that the ethnic alliance will find that continuing this war will not be worth the loss! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, the news that the army occupied Fengyue Port and the port was destroyed, spread to the kingdom together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sent along with this bad news, in addition to the apology from the front-line generals, there is also a solution proposed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum it up in one sentence, ask the Human Race Alliance for help, and organize high-level magicians to come and repair the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really embarrassing for the high-ranking magician master to act as a coolie to repair the port, but this is indeed the most effective measure at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy destroyed the waterway and replaced it with ordinary people for construction. I don't know that it will be done in the Year of the Monkey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be changed with a group of high-level magicians. If there is no suitable channel, one can be smashed by magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the benefit of the human race, if you want to persuade everyone to do coolies, it seems that you can really do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Francis, I will leave it to your Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask the alliance for magician support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed must be fast. With their efficiency, reinforcements will not be able to reach the front line without waiting for a few months! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all common. Any alliance formed by multiple forces will not be very efficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is not enough to seek the support of the wizard. Since the reduction of interest rates, our bond sales have been hindered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current battle situation, this war will not end in a short time. With our financial reserves, we simply can't last until the end of the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado said with a frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, financial resources are insufficient, on the other hand, the interest rate is high, and he is powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Borrowing is a pleasure for a while, and repayment is a crematorium. As Minister of Finance, Marquis Delgado thinks about borrowing money and repaying money every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the current bond rate?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous bond sales were very hot, and everyone rushed to **** them as soon as they were launched. More than 30 million war bonds were sold out in just a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, when the Alpha Kingdom printed bonds, it was time for the Terrans to counterattack. The market is full of confidence, and there is no fear of default at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    10% risk-free bonds, the big nobles whose money is moldy in the warehouse, naturally don't mind taking it out and running it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Four percent!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado said as a matter of course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reducing the interest rate is also a last resort. The annual interest on the previous debts alone is as high as more than three million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the high interest rate continues to be maintained, there is a high probability that the post-war Alpha Kingdom will be overwhelmed by debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi next door is an example. Even if all the nobles in the country share it together, the finances are still under pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's try the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the Alliance refuses to pay, then let them help us sell the war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talk more about our difficulties, and exaggerate our economic losses when necessary, and make them believe that the kingdom's financial resources have been exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without new infusions of money, we will not be able to continue this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the major forces in the alliance that after defeating the Orc Empire, they don't want even an inch of the land and kingdom they seized, and give them all as spoils of war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III proudly painted cakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In recent days, Hudson has been soft on the good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's a game of good news. There are so many good news from the major forces, as if they made an appointment to show off to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those big forces, one family is bigger than one family. It's like a beheading contest, the number of enemies wiped out is more than one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson thought he was hard-hearted, but after reading the content on the photo stone, he realized that he was too kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Race wars, nothing to blame. Cruelty to the enemy is also a responsibility to one's own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he couldn't bear it and killed all his allies, Hudson still agreed with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to show off your record, there is no problem at all. Master Hudson is very happy to act as a green leaf to set off their sturdy record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little false name, take it if you want it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the reason why Master Hudson didn't stir up any waves in his heart was because everyone killed the orc cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of low-level military exploits, if the number of beheaded people does not bring tens of thousands, they would be ashamed to show it to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to take it back for publicity, you still have to kill a large number of orc royal families to cause a sensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From enlistment to the present, in the countless battles Hudson commanded, the orc army annihilated was not one million, but seven or eight hundred thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are still very few records that can really be shown. The main reason is: too few main orcs have been wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this \"less\" is also relative. With the cumulative record of annihilating tens of thousands of orc royal families, Hudson surpassed many of his colleagues and temporarily ranked first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jose, draft papers for these guys separately, congratulate them on their great victory on the front line!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what Hudson said, Jose looked depressed. Originally, I thought that if I won this opportunity to enter the army, I would be able to fight a turnaround and wash away the black pot on my head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the Royal Army has started the business of transport teams, so there is not much room for development. After a battle, it was snatched away by the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, even if he wanted to gain military merit, he had to act with the royal army. If you hang out with the nobles of the Northland, there is a high probability that you will never return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a loyal minister of the king, he naturally wanted to preserve his strength for the royal family, so the royal army was left early to look after food and grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to gain military exploits is gone, but that is only for Jose personally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the royal family, they regained the lost ground in this war, and they have already eaten and drank enough, and the most important thing next is to digest the results of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without credit, you can only earn hard work. Handling official documents for Hudson became his main job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing in this state, it is estimated that when he goes back to discuss meritorious deeds and rewards, he will be able to win the title of an honorary knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't dislike the low title, that's how the rules of the game are formulated. If you want to obtain a title, you must either inherit it or go to the battlefield to obtain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without military exploits, you can't even think about making progress if you just spend a lifetime of qualifications. Even if you are hanging out with the king, you have to go to the battlefield to feel your presence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules are so rigid, just to maintain the kingdom's \"martial arts\" spirit. It is clear in the form of the system that nobles must go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Your Excellency the Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should have been a good thing to hang out with the coach. But Jose was very depressed. You must know that when the two met for the first time two years ago, he was the coach in charge of coordinating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a smart person, he naturally knew what Hudson wanted to attract him. However, as an aspiring lord, he still prefers to hang out with the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at him in a state of desperation now, in fact he did it on purpose. This time, he was sacrificed for the crown prince. How could the royal family not make up for it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the smart Jose didn't choose to accept the compensation, but decided to start over and keep the favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the busy Jose, Hudson shook his head secretly. Both of them knew what the other was thinking, and neither was willing to pierce the window paper, so the matter came to a stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wall of the king is not easy to dig, and the wall of the great nobles in the country is also not easy to dig.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of his status as the coach, Hudson has mobilized many talents from the army to listen to him, but unfortunately none of them are willing to defect to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, smart people have many ideas. Everyone is weighing the pros and cons, and everyone prefers a comfortable life to working hard from scratch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are what Hudson can't give. Compared with the prosperous big cities owned by a large number of nobles, the mountainous land is a remote country. When it develops, I don't know what year and month it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not surprised by everyone's choice. This is just like the previous life, where people had to choose between first-tier big cities and small towns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eating, drinking, entertainment, development platforms, and personal treatment are all at a disadvantage, and it is inevitable that they cannot attract talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is stingy, it's that he has too few chips in his hands and can't give others what they want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First-class talents were not found, but second- and third-rate talents were recruited. Basically, they are guys from minor aristocrats who have no titles to inherit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, who is short of people, as long as he is a talent, his background is not important. He never refuses any nobleman who intends to join him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the way to the present, it can be said that the bricks and tiles are complete, and now there are only a few \"big beams\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by the war. After the war, every family has to repair their houses. Now they have started looting “building materials”, so that Hudson can't get the “beams”.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the name of the coach, which attracted some talents to join him, it is estimated that even these \"bricks and tiles\" would not have Hudson's share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because you can't dig it out doesn't mean you can't use it. At least during his tenure as the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson was still able to command these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, if a few assistants are arranged to study with him, everyone still has to sell him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As much as you can learn, count as much. Even if a hundred people are arranged to go out, only one can become a talent, that is blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the greatest significance of Hudson as the coach is that he can openly use the resources of the kingdom to cultivate talents for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he follow along, Hudson also arranged for his own people to exercise in various key departments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not cause a backlash, the most important thing is that he did things properly. Even if they want to train their own people, they usually don't arrange principal positions, and even deputy positions are rarely arranged, and more of them follow behind to do odd jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to train the team, Hudson also worked hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Touring the camp, a special team in the distance caught Hudson's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the interests are touching, and there are still caravans who dare to go deep into the prairie at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone over to question, which chamber of commerce are they from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are you doing going deep into the orc prairie at this time? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as when the Principality of Moxi was fighting, in order to deal with the spoils, Hudson had dealt with the local Chamber of Commerce a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, those chambers of commerce only reached cooperation through the connection of local nobles. Someone guarantees the transaction from the beginning, and there is no risk of being wiped out halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The caravan in front of me is obviously different. If it was a chamber of commerce group in the kingdom, nobles would have come to say hello.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doing business behind the army is all about being humane. Hudson bets they would never have made it out of the prairie alive if no one was behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you bet on the integrity of the nobles, forget it! The forest is big and there are all kinds of birds. Although there are many honest knights, there are more greedy and cruel nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson found that he seemed to have grasped a business opportunity to get a share of the war fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The frontlines are constantly reporting good news, and countless tribes have been destroyed. The coalition forces must have a lot of spoils to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The businessman can do this business, he can do the same, and he can even do it more beautifully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too ugly to go directly to the market to do business, and it's a troublesome thing to sell the supplies, and it might end up in your own hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be different if we were looking for several chambers of commerce to cooperate and build a commodity trading platform for all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what business you do, you may lose money; only as a platform, you can make a steady profit without losing money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What needs to be paid is mainly to provide credit guarantee, and the labor cost of the venue can be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is this sale, no one has come to grab the business yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many big men in the coalition army, they are all fighting on the front line, and they may encounter the orc army at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A place where there is no guarantee of security, it is naturally impossible to be a commodity trading center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, I saw Tom walking towards this side with a middle-aged fat man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were two strong men behind him, carrying a box, but they were detained by the guards a hundred meters away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, this is Sir Xavier, the head of the Catesya Chamber of Commerce, and he came to visit you specially!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Tom finished speaking, the middle-aged fat man hurried forward and saluted Hudson: \"Xavier, the fifth-level deacon of the Catesya Chamber of Commerce, sends his regards to the respected Earl of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the box at the back are some small gifts we prepared, please accept them, Your Excellency Earl! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reaching out without hitting the smiling face, the fat middle-aged man in front of him is obviously planning to spend money to avoid disaster. In order to dispel Hudson's greed, he even used the banner of the Catesya Chamber of Commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that he made a wrong calculation this time. Hudson sent someone to stop them, not for the sake of making a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Xavier, I am familiar with the name of your chamber of commerce, but haven't you been active in the southern part of the mainland all the time, when did you open up your business to the orc prairie?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the four major chambers of commerce in the mainland, the business of the Catesya chamber of commerce is spread all over the entire continent, but the main business area is still in the southern mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we are here mainly at the invitation of Marquis Sunil to help the Frankish army deal with some minor troubles!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xavier replied neither humble nor overbearing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the fifth-level deacon of the Catesya Chamber of Commerce, he can be regarded as the middle and high level of the Chamber of Commerce. There are not a few big nobles who have dealt with them, and their mentality has long been tempered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh! Your headquarters is in the Frankish Kingdom, and it is only logical that you have some friendship with Marquis Sunil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main purpose of inviting you here this time is to tell you: In order to facilitate the coalition forces to deal with the spoils, I am going to build a commodity trading platform to provide you with a safe trading place. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson bit the word \"safety\" very hard. As long as you are not a fool, you know that this is the point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brows were slightly frowned, and Xavier's cloud turned clear in an instant, and he asked Hudson with a smile: \"Your Excellency, don't worry! We will definitely come to support at that time, it's just a matter of cost?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Catesya Chamber of Commerce is famous, it can't deter the wolves. Even if the best mercenary group is hired, going deep into the orc prairie this time is still full of dangers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Marquis of Sunil is endorsed, there is no guarantee that someone will not be able to withstand the temptation of interests and lay hands on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is done cleanly and does not leave obvious evidence, it will be very difficult to track down afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Xavier knows, there are already more than ten chambers of commerce that have had accidents on the grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In-depth investigation is required, the murderer is the \"orc\". Complaints are meaningless, everyone is busy fighting, and there is no time to care about the life and death of a caravan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, building this trading platform is mainly to facilitate free trade and make friends by the way. I won't charge commissions and the like!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be proud and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the mainland practice, platform companies charge commissions based on transaction volume, but this time the situation is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transaction object involves many nobles in the coalition army, and the commission is directly drawn from the transaction amount, which makes it easy for everyone to think that this is making money from their pockets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take a direct commission, it doesn't mean you can't make money. Compared with the naked interests on the surface, making money secretly is more in line with Hudson's character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a businessman, Xavier doesn't think that Hudson spent so much effort to build a trading platform just to make friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Xavier, don't be too surprised. To build a trading platform for free, I really want to make friends with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As you know, I am also a lord. During the development of the territory, it was inevitable to encounter many troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens that many troubles here can be solved by everyone. As friends, it is also necessary to help each other! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xavier, who was still uneasy, returned to smiling in an instant. The exchange of interests is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was really free stuffed pie, he would not dare to eat it when it was delivered to his mouth. The big nobles don't have fuel-efficient lamps, and if they get the benefits of free, the price they need to pay is often even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of transaction that puts demand on the surface is more reassuring. It is not convenient to talk about the specific details of the transaction now, but Xavier knows that the transaction has a high probability of being completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency is right, friends should benefit from each other!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, to establish a commodity trading platform, the most important thing is strength. If everyone joins in, it will easily affect the reputation of the platform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For everyone's benefit, it's better to…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Xavier finished speaking, Hudson knew that the fat man in front of him was full of bad water. Talking about strength and keeping silent about reputation is nothing more than wanting to reduce competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Xavier, you can rest assured. The Chamber of Commerce that is qualified to handle the spoils for the army must be well-known.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering large transactions, it is inconvenient to carry so many gold coins, and it is inevitable to keep accounts. This has higher requirements on the reputation and strength of the chamber of commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to paying a certain deposit, at least three nobles in the coalition army must obtain guarantees, and they must prove to us that the chamber of commerce has a complete sales network.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For caravans that cannot meet the conditions, in order to enter the trading venue, in addition to paying a deposit, we will also issue risk warnings. We recommend that you all use cash transactions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is discriminating. It's really such a big business. Without sufficient political background and strong financial strength, it is impossible to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An army's spoils, no matter how discounted the price is, is still a big deal worth tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of gold coins, which is not suitable for all cash settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Requiring all transactions in cash is actually a kind of euphemistic persuasion. Make it clear to those businessmen who have no background, don't come here to participate in this kind of business blindly, otherwise they will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The struggle in the commercial field is much more cruel than the dispute in the noble circle. It's all about naked interests, and there's no room for any warmth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The profiteering business depends on whose hands it is. Forcibly blending in businesses beyond one's ability, one is lucky not to lose everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are considerate! It's because my vision is too narrow, I only think about the issue of reputation, and ignore the reality...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said so, but he didn't think so in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In essence, they are all raising the threshold of transactions. The difference lies in the way Hudson handles it, which is taken out and framed. There is no one-size-fits-all, completely blocking the way for small and medium-sized chambers of commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 295": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 295: live to die\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 295 Living to Death\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A letter of invitation was sent out, and Hudson got busy again. To build a trading platform, you need to prepare far more things than you think.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only need to prepare trading venues, but also need enough and powerful merchants, and need enough sellers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Businessmen are the easiest to deal with. As long as the interests are big enough and safety is guaranteed, they will rush over by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troublesome thing is the \"sellers\", who are all nobles, and many relationships require Hudson to personally come forward to communicate and coordinate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, dealing with spoils is also a problem that the coalition forces just need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caravans have accidents on the way one after another, and fewer and fewer merchants are willing to take risks, resulting in a large backlog of spoils in everyone's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain the mobility of the army, many nobles had to give up some large trophies and only pick the most valuable ones to take away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson let out the news, some nobles who had harvested too much booked warehouses in advance, and even some impatient people sent people to deliver things directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson had to order overnight work to build a temporary storage warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging the Knights' camp, Captain Blake is very worried now. After robbing dozens of orc tribes in a row, the Holy See army also accumulated a large amount of spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the chamber of commerce under the Holy See was also arranged to handle it. Unexpectedly, Hudson suddenly made this happen, which made his own chamber of commerce dare not come over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the matter, why did you say it well, why didn't you come suddenly?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a system, even if he has a high position and authority, there's nothing he can do with those guys. After all, his life in the Holy See is not easy, and he cannot continue to make enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Annoyed, more like a powerless vent. If their own chamber of commerce does not come, cashing out the loot in their hands will become the biggest problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't turn against Hudson, he could still send someone to the trading center to find a buyer. At this time, if you go to the door, who knows if you will be cheated!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, don't be so angry, let's discuss things slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sacred Chamber of Commerce refused to come, it was a last resort. The front line is too dangerous. In the past month, they have already had two caravans robbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, after the Earl of Hudson built a trading platform, the risk of going directly to the front line is even greater! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon calmly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The caravan of the Sacred Chamber of Commerce was robbed, Blake was clearly aware of it, he sent people to the scene to investigate, and finally all the clues pointed to the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the enemy did it, the investigation ended without a problem. At most, they would cut down a few more orcs on the battlefield to vent their anger on the chamber of commerce, and they had to bear the losses themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is there to worry about, don't they dare to rob our chamber of commerce?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon, please tell the person in charge of the chamber of commerce that we will put magic marks on the products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone robs them, once the goods are out of the market, we can follow the clues to find the murderer and help them recover all their losses! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said domineeringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the top power in the mainland, he has the confidence to make a promise. It's a pity that Blake is facing his own people, and this kind of promise has no effect at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, don't embarrass others. If someone dares to rob us, do you think they will use the normal way to sell the stolen goods?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influence of the Holy See in the Alpha Kingdom is extremely limited. Even if the stolen goods are found, it will be difficult to trace them all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson wants to build a trading platform, so let him do it, anyway, we also need such a place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy Chamber of Commerce has already received an invitation to settle in. Only some specific details have not been negotiated, so there is no need to continue to toss. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Simon said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both belong to the camp of the Holy See, and the internal forces are also chaotic. The fact that the Judgment Knights did not deal with Hudson does not mean that the Holy Chamber of Commerce also has a grudge against Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it belongs to the Holy See, the Holy Chamber of Commerce is a commercial organization after all, and the first thing that comes to mind when considering issues is profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the Judgment Knights, there are many dangers along the way, and they can only do business with this family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they enter the trading platform, the sellers they face will be the coalition of the entire human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially, the threshold of the platform is high enough to eliminate a large number of potential competitors. With the strength of the Holy Chamber of Commerce, it is enough to get a big piece of fat from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Blake's idea, it is no longer considered in the category at all. It's nothing more than trying to lose face by judging the Knights, and it won't harm the interests of the Holy See, so why bother with money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You... you guys, if you do this, you won't be afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake swallowed the words before he could finish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking stock, he couldn't find a reason to change the decision of the Holy Chamber of Commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the barrel of a gun is strong, the money bag is not vegetarian. He made a fuss over this, and it was himself who suffered in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, do you really want to lead the team there in person? You must know that this trip goes deep behind the enemy's rear, and the journey is full of dangers!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig has the commonality of Beamon—paranoia, once he decides something, nine bulls can't pull it back. As a think tank, Clark only felt tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, it can be said that going deep into the enemy's rear to destroy is basically a task of ten deaths and no lives. Any clues left behind will be strangled by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how empty the interior of the Alpha Kingdom is, it still has the strength to strangle a few orc squads. If it really doesn't work, at most tens of thousands of troops will be dispatched to go back to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous arrival of reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance, even if the battle line is stretched, the advantage of the Human Race on the battlefield is still expanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the five royal families would rather pay a high price to relocate their clansmen than confront the human coalition force head-on, is enough to explain a lot of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex's authority is getting stronger and stronger, and those competitors have been tormented enough. Although I kept a low profile as soon as I came back, it is inevitable that I will not be hated by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once I let him clean up those few, it will be my turn next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Alex is the emperor of the Beamon clan, as long as he wants to find fault, there are plenty of ways to torment me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply take a task and go out to avoid the limelight. On the day of his return, it is estimated that the imperial court was almost cleaned up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A prince who has lost his influence in the army is the best Prince Beamon. I still have this political awareness! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said in a low tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But whenever there is a third way, he will not choose to take risks. But there is no way, he had already asked himself to be responsible for the migration of the tribe, but unfortunately Alex rejected it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he continues to stay in the army, he is a hidden danger that threatens the imperial power. No matter who is in the position of Emperor Bimeng, he must be cleared of this hidden danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the time of war, for the sake of the unity of the Beamon clan, Alex's hands and feet were bound, otherwise the butcher knife would have chopped at him long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passively waiting to die is not his style. Butzweig would rather fall on the battlefield than die in the midst of internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying in the country and continuing to lead troops, Alex will only be more afraid of him, but it is better to take the initiative to ask Ying to go deep behind the enemy lines and make a risky gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he can come back alive, he will be considered a smooth landing in this political turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A prince who gave everything for the Beamon family, even if it was just for political propaganda, Alex had to confess him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a change in the imperial court in the future, he still has a chance to fight for the position of Emperor Bimeng with the created character design.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Alex is old. More than twice his age, Butzweig could have slowly boiled him to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, since you have made up your mind to go south, I will not advise you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If His Highness's trip was just to avoid disaster, there is still a 60 to 70% chance of getting out. If you want to make meritorious deeds, I'm afraid... ten deaths and no life! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a counselor, he has to act with Prince Butzweig. If the boss hits the street, he, the younger brother, won't survive either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current persuasion is not only to save Prince Butzweig, but also to save his own life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I'm not a fool. The war has progressed so far, and the empire has lost. No matter how hard we toss behind the enemy, it can't change everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, the population loss of each of the five major royal families has exceeded 20%, and the proportion of young and old is even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this strategic shift, the strength of each ethnic group will be further weakened. The rear is good for defense, but those barren lands will also restrict our development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race changes its strategy and supports several powerful races, we will wait for the civil war every day! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the top secrets of the Orc Empire. If he wasn't too depressed and needed someone to confide in, he wouldn't say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, I'm afraid this kind of thing will really happen. The human race is best at sowing discord, especially our neighbor is Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout his actions since he took the throne, sowing discord and playing with balance are all his usual methods. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark analyzed in as calm a tone as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe immersed in it, Prince Butzweig did not get angry, but nodded and said: \"You are right, as long as Caesar III is still alive, we will face these situations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the specific executor, I can guess. Caesar III appointed the young Hudson as the commander of the army, clearly preparing for the destruction of the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculate the age and know that at Hudson's age, he can at least be entangled with the empire for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wise and calculating king + the young and enterprising commander, in the years to come, we will never have peace again! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the defeat of Dapes, Prince Butzweig has passively turned into a blow. Perhaps he has boasted too many times, and now he believes it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that were originally irrelevant, but after he made up his mind, they were pulled together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, do you want to assassinate Caesar III?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark asked in shock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing a human king is a debt to the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the question is how easy is the king to assassinate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the identity of an orc, I guess he was wiped out before he even entered the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, we don't need to do it ourselves. The empire will send experts to carry it out. With my strength, I am not worthy of being an assassin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to implement it, you don't need to know for now. At that time, there will be someone to help create opportunities. This time, the empire is taking advantage of others! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war has changed too many people and things. Compared with the high spirits before the war, at this moment he is only left with sadness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that they are being used as a knife, the Orc Empire has to thank the other party for the opportunity with a smiling face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the assassination is successful or not, it is impossible for the masters involved in the attack to come back alive. All possible traces of exposure will be erased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the Orc Empire needs to pay is: After the assassination is completed, take the initiative to shoulder the responsibility of the assassination, and must not disclose any information about the collaborators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contract documents have been signed, and the five emperors are all contract makers, and they can't go back on their word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if you want to leak the secret, it is difficult. High officials of the empire, including Prince Butzweig, do not know who the real collaborators are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few insiders are bound by the power of the contract. You can't pay for your own emperor in order to divert hatred, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Clark. You should also go down and prepare. No one can say whether we can come back alive this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First arrange the family members, so as not to cause accidents for us, and make our wives and children feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you need anything, you can tell me. Although my prince has passed away, I still have a bit of face in the imperial court! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I saw two figures passing by just now, and they disappeared from sight!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, the face of the bearded captain changed. In the ordinary world, you may suspect that you have misread it, but in the extraordinary world, it is completely possible to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either the enemy masters passed by, or there were really ghosts. No matter what kind of situation it is, it can bring a fatal threat to this patrol team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't think about it, keep patrolling!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he said so, secretly he has decided to go back and report the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make a mistake, it will be a waste of work. If the enemy's master sneaks in, something big will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The patrol team was lucky, the weather was calm along the way, and nothing happened except for a few howling wolves in the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the bearded captain reported the news, turmoil had already occurred in the barracks, and the two patrol teams did not return to the camp on time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of accident has not happened before. But it was all because of sudden bad weather, which affected the speed of the patrol, or was attacked by wild animals halfway, which delayed the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is obviously different. Not only did the team fail to return on time, even the distress signal was not sent out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officer on duty realized that something was wrong and immediately reported to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to send out the Second Legion to conduct a comprehensive search within a radius of 30 miles. Please follow along with the enshrined regiment and find the missing soldiers!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"yes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone dared to go to his barracks to make troubles, it was like breaking ground on the head of Tai Sui. Vaguely, Hudson felt something was wrong again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orcs wanted to attack, they had to pick weak spots to break through. What's the use of running to him to get a few patrolling soldiers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to sneak attack?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is bragging, there is no main force of orcs with more than one legion, and coming here is to give him military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of thousands of horses want to sneak in, but that only exists in a dream. The coalition forces on the front line are not dead, no matter how blind they are, they will not let tens of thousands of enemy troops slip away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially with the air force patrolling in the sky, on the vast prairie, tens of thousands of soldiers and horses have nowhere to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the time when the coalition forces set off to the present, the number of orcs who successfully infiltrated the team at one time was more than a thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And just about to come out to do something, accidentally exposed his traces, and was slaughtered by the coalition forces who heard the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a small group of troops sneaking in, and Hudson was more willing to believe that these guys went the wrong way and accidentally bumped into his territory by mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the route map of the food delivery team hanging in the tent, Hudson shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, each food **** team has at least one regiment of troops, and there is an air force patrolling overhead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if an orc squad launches an attack, the nearby human coalition forces can come to support in time. At least the Air Force can arrive as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from Griffon Cavalry, the load capacity of Yalong mounts is obviously much higher. It is no problem to sit two or three more people on a flying dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of this that the infiltrated orc team dared not make any moves during the day, and only came out to move around at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marching in a dark environment, it is difficult to find the target, let alone accurately figure out the strength of the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the offensive was launched in a daze, and then the battle was ended in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the number of sneak attack teams sent by the orcs, the record achieved is really touching. Anyway, Hudson, the captain of the transportation team, has never felt the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong with the orcs, but he didn't know what was wrong, Hudson could only order to strengthen his guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, along with the Alpha Kingdom's request for help, another dispute broke out in the Human Race Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike in the past, this time it is not a dispute of consent or not. All-out war has broken out, and our own troops have gone to the front line to fight, and support is a must.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to the number of masters that need to be dispatched, everyone disagrees again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to clear a channel in the ocean, ordinary magicians are not even qualified to participate, and only a very small number of high-level magicians have this ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the amount of work, to complete the cleaning work in a short period of time, this technical work requires the cooperation of several high-level magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is much more difficult to invite these mage masters to do coolies than to send them to the battlefield. Even if the leaders of the major forces go out in person, they can only persuade them with good words, or they may be scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how difficult it is, we have to solve it. After rounds of quarrels, we finally reached a preliminary consensus. Just as they were preparing for in-depth communication, a new proposal from the representative of the Alpha Kingdom broke the tranquility of the venue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ask for money\", this is much more difficult than asking for people. Everyone knows that war is a gold-swallowing behemoth, and it is destined to be a protracted war to destroy the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the alliance takes over this burden, it will be responsible for it to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    10 million, 20 million, 30 million... These layouts are all small, without the expense of hundreds of millions of gold coins, it is impossible to complete this epic task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention anything else, from the outbreak of the war to the present, the total military expenditure of the four kingdoms of Alpha Kingdom, Moxie Duchy, Warhammer Kingdom, and Orton Duchy has exceeded 100 million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the outbreak of the war, this was a number that no one could have imagined. But with a war, it was squandered like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number is equivalent to the entire population of the above four countries, and each person contributed two gold coins of war funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual ratio should be higher. Because of the war, the population of the four countries has dropped significantly, and the corresponding per capita share has also risen accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to raise funds, the Principality of Moxi first issued war bonds, then the Kingdom of Warhammer issued post-war reconstruction bonds, and then the Kingdom of Alpha issued war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only Principality of Orton that has not borrowed on a large scale is because they have spent too much time in the war and have not had time to spend the huge military expenditure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Predrag, didn't your country just issue a war bond, why are you short of money again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning of the year, bonds worth more than 30 million gold coins were printed, and bonds worth 20 million gold coins were issued recently. The Alpha Kingdom has surpassed the Principality of Moxi and has become a veritable debt king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the military expenditure is a bottomless pit, it can generally be estimated one or two. It is obviously impossible to spend so much money all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, our second batch of bonds is slow to sell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe we have reached the limit of the market, or maybe the market is worried about our repayment ability. In short, people are no longer enthusiastic about buying our war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, all our military expenditures come from the funds raised from the bond at the beginning of the year, and two-thirds of it has now been disbursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The market is right to worry about our repayment ability. The orcs did not engage in a decisive battle with the coalition forces, but deliberately shifted to the rear in an attempt to continue to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been dragging on like this, no one knows how long this war will last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that the Alpha Kingdom has suffered heavy losses in this war, and there is a high probability that its post-war financial revenue will be cut in half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom's debts continue to expand without limit, it is very likely that in the end, we will not even be able to pay the interest on the funds! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Predrag said without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a direct showdown, and the Alpha Kingdom has financial problems. If it is impossible for the alliance to reach out, it will be difficult for them to guarantee the logistics of the frontline army for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in their hearts, after secretly calculating an economic account, everyone looked at Earl Predrag with sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanting the Alpha Kingdom to raise the bond interest rate, everyone dismissed it in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is not a matter of interest on funds. If the debt continues to increase and accumulates to the end, I am afraid that even the principal may not be able to be recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No money, no money. Compared with Lao Lai who refuses to repay his debts, this kind of debtor who really has no money is the most troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being nervous, there is peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the responsible attitude shown by the Alpha Kingdom, it is obvious that they are concerned about the debt issue and have no intention of showing it to be bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you actively deal with it, there is a solution. In particular, the Alpha Kingdom has regained a lot of lost land. As long as it regains its vitality, debts will no longer be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Predrag, the Alpha Kingdom is the biggest beneficiary of the destruction of the Orc Empire. To be fair, you need to pay compensation to the Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the benefits that your country can obtain, we only ask your country to bear military expenses, which is not too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that your country has financial problems, you should actively take measures to solve them instead of passing the responsibility to the alliance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Monteson said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Holy See was worried about how to suppress the Alpha Kingdom, but now he was able to watch his rival fall into financial crisis, he was too happy, so how could he extend his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we have already taken measures. The bonds have been printed, but we can't sell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As we all know, the wealth of the Holy See is the highest in the entire continent. If His Excellency the Bishop can represent the Holy See and subscribe for this batch of war bonds, we will never trouble the Alliance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Predrag replied with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a well-known fact that the Holy See is rich and powerful. However, the main reason is the wealth of the former Holy See. It has been living beyond its means for hundreds of years, and its old capital has been almost eaten up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for making money, the Holy See would not have conflicts with governments of various countries. Half of the current notoriety is a legacy of history, and the other half is caused by conflicts of interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the income on paper alone, the financial revenue of the Holy See is still the highest in the mainland. However, it is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the senior officials of the Holy See are used to the current luxurious life. If you want them to lower their living standards, that is the biggest heresy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is sophistry! If your country raises the bond interest rate...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the words came to his lips, Bishop Montesson swallowed them back. This is a paradox. If you follow the other party's preset routine, no matter how you answer it, you will be wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bonds cannot be sold if the interest rate is low, and if the interest rate is high, even the principal may not be kept, so it is even more difficult to sell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone misses the good old days when the Mosi were peddling war bonds. Not to mention the high interest rate, the repayment ability is still guaranteed. Directly levy a repayment tax and forcefully apportion it to the nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same operation cannot be copied in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi people can bear it, it is the moment when the country is ruined and the family is destroyed. If they don't accept it, the family will be destroyed. Even if it harms their own interests, the nobles can only hold their noses and admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the era of major counterattacks. Even if the war is forced to end early because of lack of money, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom can accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, if you want to cut flesh and **** blood from them for a long time, you don't even think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, ending the war ahead of schedule, the embarrassment is everyone's embarrassment. If the Terran Alliance can afford to lose people, the Alpha Kingdom can also not care about face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, both of you. Everyone is for the supremacy of the human race. There is no need to quarrel over trivial matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has financial problems and is unable to afford the high war expenses. This is a realistic problem that urgently needs to be resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the war will continue. All races in the mainland are looking at us, if it ends in such a dismal situation, how can the dominance of the human race be stabilized?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the shortage of war funds, the Alpha Kingdom also proposed three solutions. In addition to the first two, there is another one that is to auction the land of the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't rush to refuse, the natural conditions of the orc prairie are relatively good. As long as there is no threat of orcs, it can also become fertile ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we don't need these lands, there are still future generations who need them. If you miss this opportunity, it will be difficult to acquire so much high-quality land in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III tried his best to sell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the representatives present are all old foxes, no matter how much he fools around, everyone will not move like a mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the potential development value, the current orc prairie is just a piece of white land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to develop it, you don't know how much resources you need to invest. The benefit is only to be able to arrange for a few younger generations, for the whole family, there is no substantial improvement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all a lesson of blood. How many nobles are left now that were fooled by the Alpha Kingdom to take root in the north?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have suffered a loss once, and I want to come a second time. It's a pity that everyone has learned their lesson and is not interested in the big cakes drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene was left cold, and Charles III was helpless. Everyone is unwilling to invest a large amount of resources in the orc prairie, and he himself is also unwilling to spend money in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large investment and long return period are only one factor. What worries him the most is the safety issue. The orcs all retreated all the way and never fought a decisive battle with the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the five royal families of the orcs successfully evacuated from the prairie, the difficulty of destroying them suddenly increased several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is a big matter, and everyone can't decide for a while. I think it's better to put it on hold and discuss it after the war is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the war funding gap, the Alliance will subsidize part of it, and the remaining funding gap will be raised by the Alpha Kingdom itself. Everyone contributes to buy the war bonds issued by them first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lower the interest rate, the lower it is, who made us all allies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's about the hegemony of the human race, and we can't count these small accounts! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Djortevich opened his mouth to smooth things over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I want to see Charles III's jokes, the current situation must focus on the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the second largest kingdom of the human race, Iberia is also a beneficiary of the continental hegemony system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with their own real interests, the little emotional dispute with the Frankish Kingdom is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A solution that is close to muddy, although all parties are not very satisfied, it is also a solution that everyone can reluctantly accept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few poor ghosts who were also victims of the war, the representatives of the remaining major forces finally chose to accept after whispering to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of millions of gold coins are an astronomical sum for any country. After dismantling and sharing among hundreds of forces, the numbers suddenly became acceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the money is still loaned out and can be recovered in the future. It is nothing more than the rate of return, which is so low that it makes people speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's right, the Alpha Kingdom's war bond rates have dropped again. A few days ago, there was still an annual interest rate of 4%, but by the time it was submitted to the alliance meeting, it had dropped to 1%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The super-long repayment period of 20 years, coupled with the 1% annual interest rate, no wonder no one cares about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the pitiful interest income, perhaps feeling that the previous performance had lost points, Charles III waved his hand and said proudly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all for the supremacy of the human race. We will not charge interest on the 1.8 million war bonds subscribed by the Frankish Kingdom this time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The income of a mere 18,000 gold coins per year is equivalent to the income of a wealthy baronie, which is really not in the eyes of Charles III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a small price that is not costly, I can exchange for a good reputation for myself, and by the way, I can also shorten the relationship with the Alpha Kingdom. No matter how you look at it, it is not a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Frankish Kingdom is so righteous, and Iberia can't be ambiguous. The interest on our 1.5 million bonds should also be waived!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Djortevich said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing is not losing. As the second kingdom on the mainland, it has always competed with the Frankish kingdom, and it cannot lose in terms of momentum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bosses have made a good start, and the next step is to test the relationship between countries. In the blink of an eye, dozens of forces that have a good relationship with the Alpha Kingdom expressed their willingness to give up interest income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson, who was just eating melons and watching the excitement, suddenly found that the eyes of the people looking at him were not right, and instantly realized that the situation was not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I was cheated again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Bishop Montesson immediately greeted Charles III's family deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a religious organization, the Holy See should have taken the lead in this kind of prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, because of the grievances with the Alpha Kingdom, it affected his judgment and missed the best opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention being robbed by Charles III, he was also generalized by a group of mainland countries. No matter what choice he makes now, he will inevitably be criticized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder everyone is cooperating so actively. At first, I thought that the Alpha Kingdom had solved the problem, but I didn't expect that they came for the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Exchanging the price of 8,000 gold coins for a chance to attack the prestige of the Holy See is **** money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The order he gave was \"to see people when you are alive, and to see corpses when you are dead.\" Unexpectedly, what was finally found was a pile of bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    have all become bones, and the identity of the deceased is naturally impossible to define. As the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson can't do anything to disturb the rest of the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Take it down, so that it can be buried alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigation into the disappearance of the soldiers has come to an end, but the problem of the infiltration of the orcs has not yet been resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the infiltration of large groups of enemies, this kind of squad is the most difficult to deal with. Just find a bush to hide, and you can hide it from the air force in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson added: \"Tom, send an order to order all troops to clear the grass and shrubs within five miles of the camp, and the grass and trees must not exceed five inches.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a stupid method, but it is the most effective defense. Without cover, the enemy launched another sneak attack, which was bound to reveal their tracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are exposed, you can use breath tracking to find people in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trade fair is just around the corner, and Hudson really doesn't want to cause trouble. If the orcs sneak in and cause damage, where will he save his face?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dark night, dozens of furtive figures came under the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the one with the lights on on the left is Bloodmoon Castle. As long as you turn over from here, you can enter the hinterland of the Alpha Kingdom unimpeded.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what his subordinates said, and glancing at the towering city walls, Prince Butzweig felt sad for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally these areas were the territory of the Orc Empire. When he was stationed at the border, the location of the governor's camp was behind the Blood Moon Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sadness cannot change the fact that it is occupied by humans. According to past experience, as long as the human race built a city in the local area, they rarely brought it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time they seized the seven northern provinces of the Alpha Kingdom, it was at the price of betraying their allies. If it weren't for the betrayal last time, they wouldn't have fought alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's change the place, this is the enemy's military base, it is not suitable as a breakthrough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has not occupied this land for a long time, and the defense line cannot be built so quickly. If you follow this line of defense, there will definitely be new breakthroughs! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the top executive of the Orc Empire, he naturally knows exactly where the human defense line has been repaired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he pretends not to know anything in front of his subordinates, and asks everyone to search all the way along the defense line, which is obviously deliberately delaying time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People cannot help themselves in the political arena. Prince Butzweig, who took the initiative to ask for a job, never dreamed that Alex \"valued him so much\" and directly arranged for him to assassinate Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was already dangerous enough to go deep behind enemy lines and wreak havoc. Now let him take someone to assassinate the king, it is clear that he is not going to let him come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People have to bow their heads under the eaves. When he was in the imperial court, he could only grit his teeth and take on the task. Now that they're all out, naturally they can't be foolish enough to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't refuse the task, can't delay the time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For such a terrible event, the assassins sent by the Orc Empire must not be the only team. As long as it is dragged to other teams, it can also be considered as completing the task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all fail, drag Alex to see the Beast God. Anyway, this is deep behind enemy lines, and all kinds of accidents may happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the enemy is obviously prepared and is waiting for us to be caught. It is difficult to keep secrets by forcefully crossing at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about I go west, cross the prairie, pass through the kingdom of ice and snow, detour all the way through the Kingdom of Warhammer, the Principality of Moxi, and then enter the Kingdom of Alpha? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark suggested along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the longest route, the hardest route to take, and the safest route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ice and snow world in the west does not belong to either the human race or the orcs. Most of the people living in it are the ancient survivors and some cold-resistant monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number is not many, the strength of these guys is not weak at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remarkable strength, coupled with the harsh natural environment is not conducive to the action of the army, making the world of ice and snow a paradise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One word revealed Prince Butzweig's true inner thoughts. No matter how the situation develops next, it is right to go to the world of ice and snow and hang on first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all assassins are as reluctant as Prince Butzweig, and there are also many orcs with dreams, crossing the city wall and starting a new journey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lucky ones sneaked into the capital safely; the more unlucky ones brought death on themselves before they understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there are many teams responsible for sabotage, helping to share the pressure, otherwise their actions will be exposed in advance before they officially start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are on the move, and other forces are not idle. In a small farmyard in the Northland, a fierce quarrel broke out among the high-level members of the July Club.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has been going on until now, not only has there been no chance of revenge, but it has made this dream farther and farther.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundations of the five major families in the Northland are far deeper than they imagined. Apart from leaking the news to the orcs and completing the assassination of a duke, they have achieved nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of messy plans not only failed to make them flourish, but made their names even more notorious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs are too useless. So many opportunities have been created for them, but they have been wasted. They deserve to be exterminated!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A young man said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For revenge, they all gave their all, but in the end they watched the five major families grow more and more prosperous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, against the background of the heavy losses of the nobles in the kingdom, the five major families in the Northland showed signs of going further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Collen, be reasonable. Anger doesn't solve any problems, it only makes them more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous series of failures, in the final analysis, we put our hope of revenge on others, hoping that the orcs can help us destroy the five major families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it turns out, this doesn't work. If we want to truly destroy the five major families, we still have to rely on our own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, someone paid a big price, let us find the Assassin Organization to place an order for us to assassinate Caesar III! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing about killing the king, everyone's expressions changed drastically. Everyone only wanted to kill the five major families in the Northland, but they didn't plan to kill the king together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are the children of nobles. No matter how poor they are now, they have experienced some family education. It is very clear what regicide means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leader, this is absolutely unacceptable! We are all children of the kingdom's nobles, how could we do such a rebellious thing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The leader, the three elders are right, you can't do regicide! Most of the people here are uneasy and kind, and want to kill us in July...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rush of persuasion made the old man turn pale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a retelling, without even saying that it would be done, and it attracted such fierce opposition. If it is really implemented, I don't know what kind of backlash it will cause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"President, do you mean to find an opportunity to blame this matter on the northern nobles?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi's words caused a different light to flash in the eyes of the people who originally opposed fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They cannot do regicide. But if the northern nobles did it, they would have no pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that such a big event, even if you want to frame it, is not so easy to operate. If they are not careful, they will be found out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they get involved with the regicide, not only will they themselves suffer, but even the families behind them will also have to be pulled out of the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you leave the Alpha Kingdom, it is useless. The countries on the mainland have surprisingly unanimous positions on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who plays the game of killing the king, he will be hunted down by the whole continent. The history of the human race has been passed down for countless years, and there are very few kings who were assassinated to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are all ignorant, I told you to read more, but you just didn't listen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you can't even understand the good and bad words, it's because you still call yourself the sons of nobles! When did nobles turn into big bosses! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the prestige is just an illusion, deep down in his heart he is also panicked. If it weren't for the help of his subordinates to help out, he really didn't expect to blame the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with IQ, it is purely an inherent concept, which prevents him from breeding such outrageous thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, there is no need to wait until now, it has been used countless years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the disguise is dismantled, it can still sow discord. Anyway, the relationship between the king and the nobles of the north is not good, and the two sides will fight more fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such an interruption, everyone lowered their heads. There is no moral pressure in their hearts to frame the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Chairman, there are as many assassin organizations on the mainland as a feather. But there are very few who dare to take this kind of order and have the strength to complete the task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our July Society also belongs to the dark organization, it is different from them after all. Among the assassin organizations we have dealt with, none of them can meet the requirements!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, we don't know the origin of the mysterious person behind the scenes who asked to place the order on his behalf. What if he sells us out after everything is done? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a slave trader who is not afraid of heaven and earth, this time he is really afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Framing and framing is easy to say, but this is an extraordinary world, and there are many extraordinary investigative methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes the dead can speak, let alone a group of living people. It doesn't matter what link leaks, as long as it is involved, the July meeting will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If they can hide, so can we. Find a few chess pieces that we secretly control in the five major families, and let them place an order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, let them take all the rewards and deposit them in the Assassin's Guild. As soon as the person comes out, kill them immediately!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to check, let them go to the five major families to check! Regardless of whether the charges can be settled on their heads, they can bear it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the July Society, but almost at the same time, several cult organizations in the Alpha Kingdom received \"sponsorship\" from the mysterious person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of a sudden, the underground world boiled up. With the surging undercurrent, the storm went straight to Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the sunshine of autumn, Hudson warmly entertained every guest coming and going. This is the third day since the trading platform opened, and the turnover has already exceeded the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just what Hudson guessed from the smiles on everyone's faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a purely public welfare organization, the platform does not even charge commissions, so naturally it will not inquire about the specific turnover of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eleven chambers of commerce that have entered the trading platform are all big chambers of commerce with strength and background, and each of them was negotiated by Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about making friends, there is absolutely no insider trading. At most, it is between friends, giving each other a certain amount of care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the secret contracts, this explanation would be more convincing. It's a pity that Hudson has always been skeptical about the friendship that the merchant said, and finally chose a secret agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a nobleman, a verbal agreement is probably enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Hudson didn't want much, he just agreed that in the next ten years, the materials purchased from major chambers of commerce must be settled at cost prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reassure everyone, he even made a promise: All materials purchased at cost prices will only be used for his own use and will not be taken out to hit the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the materials here are not only ordinary commodities, but also some things that are rarely seen by the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transaction, the most important thing is win-win. There is no doubt that this wave is a typical resource exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, do you really want to sell all the bonds in your hand?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    became friends, and many things became easier. For example, now, Hudson is carrying a box of war bonds, asking everyone to help cash them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To tell you the truth, I am not optimistic about the repayment ability of the Principality of Moxi. The bond interest they promised is too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only my 1.28 million bonds, the interest on the funds that needs to be paid every year is as high as 160,000 gold coins. And their total debt is more than thirty times that figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the interest they need to pay on the funds every year will not be less than six million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, their annual financial income before the war broke out was only six or seven million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just interest, and the principal needs to be repaid?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they promised to collect a repayment tax from the nobles across the country. However, most of the territory of the Principality of Moxi has been reduced to a battlefield, and it is still barren. How can the noble lords pay taxes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, they can still rely on borrowing new ones to return the old ones, but problems will definitely occur after a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if a group of creditors can accept the debt extension, this is actually a good deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, my situation is special, and I have to raise funds for post-war reconstruction in advance. Even if I know that holding these bonds for a long time can make me a fortune, I can only reluctantly sell them now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said half-truthfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problems facing the Principality of Moxi are all on the surface. It didn't cause the creditors to panic, that's because there has never been a precedent of a country defaulting on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The debt extension proposed by Hudson is already the worst situation that everyone can think of. Under normal circumstances, as long as they take a breather, the Moxi people will continue to pay their debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he could not mention these risks. It's just that the representatives of the chamber of commerce present are all elites in the business field, and they can't hide it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if you don't warn about the risks, if these risky assets are held by the major chambers of commerce, won't they all have to be charged to him when the debts explode?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is not difficult to help you deal with this batch of bonds. However, the premium cannot be too high, after all, we have to consider risks!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purple-clothed old man said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doing business, how can there be no risk?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with private lending, the war bonds of the Principality of Moxi are considered high-quality assets in the capital market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when gold and silver were used as currency, there was almost no inflation, and a stable income of seven or eight points was enough for everyone to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war bonds issued by the Alpha Kingdom before, the ten-point interest rate was looted, which is the best example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Gustav, if you are worried about bond risks, you can transfer the risks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Procure strategic materials from the coalition forces. When paying, everyone can tentatively use bonds to settle the settlement and see everyone's reaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a war bond, the war belonging to the Mosi is over. With the credit endorsement of the Principality of Moxi, these bonds can be used as gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, these gold coins are also assets with their own income. Among them, the highest interest rate is as high as 30% per annum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are worried about risks, and now take this high-yield bond to the Principality of Moxi, they definitely don't mind paying it in advance, and you can even talk about paying a premium.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all friends, and there is no need for us to talk about such nonsense. This business was also split up, and one family only had hundreds of thousands of bonds, which is not a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone uses their professional experience to estimate the prices of bonds with different interest rates. I also estimate the prices myself, and write them on parchment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your average price is higher than my quotation, or not lower than 5% of my quotation, how about this business being concluded at the average price? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can sell the high-risk bonds in your hands, it is considered good. What's more, it is still sold at a premium, no matter how much the premium can be, it is a blood profit for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long-term holding, unless exchanged for bonds of Alpha Kingdom. Even if he can't pay it, he can take it out to deduct taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is the risk he is most worried about. In the hands of the moxi nobles, they also hold a large amount of war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the end of the two-year tax holiday, Moxi nobles who have no money in their pockets will most likely use these war bonds to offset the repayment tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it impossible for the family not to recognize the bonds that they have initiated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currencies are all gold and silver, even if you want to play with currency devaluation to reduce debt, it is not feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the \"repayment tax\" that should have been collected to repay the debt turned into a pile of war bonds, it was the time when the debt of the Principality of Moxi was thundering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this thunder, the longer it drags on, the more powerful it will be. Who let the Principality of Moxi keep enough cash flow for the treasury to deal with the crisis after the war ended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When awarding meritorious officials and paying officials' arrears, all of them are given in bonds?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the outside world, the debt of the Principality of Moxi is more than 30 million gold coins, but the real debt figure is only known to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 298": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 298: assassination case\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 298 Assassination case\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the average price given by the chambers of commerce, Hudson nodded in satisfaction. The price is slightly higher than his estimated price, and it can be seen that everyone is still saving face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    1.28 million bonds discounted to 1.5 million gold coins, no matter how you look at it, it's a lie. However, in this price, the premium of more than 90% is the bonus brought about by his position as commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, where the class is stable, everyone is now a partner, and there is a high probability that they will be a partner in the future. This is how the circle is established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For large chambers of commerce, going out to do business has always been \"politics first, business second\". If you don't understand this point, no matter how big the deal is, it will be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that this 1.5 million gold coins is also only wealth on paper. He has to wait for everyone to sell the bonds before he can get the money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not worried about this. Even if the Moxi people want to have a thunderstorm, they will not immediately have a thunderstorm. At least this year's interest payment is still guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the premium is high, but the interest payment time for some bonds is coming soon. At the latest, after five months, you can also get cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just five months, you can get back 160,000 interest. The capital premium of 220,000 gold coins seems not unacceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, the debt will be thundered, and the one who will be tricked will only be the last successor. I don't know how many times it changed hands during the period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the limited channels in hand and the huge amount of bonds that could not be realized in a short period of time, Hudson would not ask these Chambers of Commerce for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the bond price of the Principality of Moxi will continue to rise in the capital market for a period of time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart nobles will find a reasonable time to sell the war bonds in their hands to cash out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, in addition to the war bonds of the Principality of Moxi, Hudson also holds 500,000 war bonds of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has nothing to do with economic returns, buying these bonds is purely a political necessity. The king and the great nobles took the lead in paying for the subscription.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It could have been sold together to cash out, but Hudson didn't do that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the great nobleman of the kingdom, he may not be optimistic about the Principality of Moxi, but he must be optimistic about the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the kingdom's finances are really going bankrupt, the great nobles can only grit their teeth and stay with them. It seems a bit tragic, but this is exactly what Hudson appreciates most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the ruling class of a country cannot share the difficulties with the country, then the country is destined to be unable to withstand wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The greatest significance of the existence of the trading platform is not how much benefit Hudson has reaped, but to stimulate the enthusiasm of the coalition forces in combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, everyone killed the enemy on the front line mainly to pretend to be aggressive and show off their bravery. Now there is another reason added-profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other things may be imaginary, but the spoils are real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Orc Empire is generally poor, there are always rich people in a country. Ordinary orcs don't cover their bodies, but this does not affect the silk and satin of the tribal leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only goods can be cashed out, slaves are also a good deal. In the past, it was inconvenient to carry and could only be solved with a single knife, but now it is earned as soon as you catch it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the coalition forces killing all directions on the battlefield, the Kingdom army is also eager to try, but Hudson forcibly suppressed everyone's desire to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After defeating the orc empire, the Alpha Kingdom was the biggest winner. If it came out to grab the spoils with its allies, it would be too ugly to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the coalition army can kill all directions, that's because they are all the elites of the major forces, and most of the kingdom's army are serf soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to **** the food and grass, and go to the front to fight the orcs. What if the enemy pushes back?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, what Hudson needs is stability. The coalition defeated the orcs, and his credit for transporting food and grass to support the army's logistics was stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to kill the enemy, you have to wait until the coalition forces have severely damaged the enemy's main force before going to make up for it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beat the dog in the water, Hudson is the professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the old site of the Beamon Royal Court is ahead. It's a pity that the gang of **** Beamon burned down the camp before they evacuated, and now there are only ruins left!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Adjutant Jose's introduction, Hudson was speechless. It has forced people to abandon the imperial court and run away, can they still be expected to stay in the old capital politely?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if there are ruins and desolation, as long as the Bimon Royal Court is underfoot, it will be a great strategic victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics troops moved all the way to the royal court of the orcs, and the advance speed of the coalition forces on the front line was even faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current speed of progress, a little more optimism can occupy the orc prairie within the year and force the orcs to a truly bitter cold place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter, the ruins are good! The ruins are just pushed to be rebuilt, but since this is the Bimon Imperial Court, let's keep it for now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe His Majesty the King, when he is in the mood for elegance, will come over in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to the Duke of Cavadia, telling him that the grain hoarded in Fengyue Port can now be arranged for transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another wharf is left for merchant ships. All merchant ships with a pass issued by the headquarters can use this pier! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the power of magic is powerful. With the current productivity, to clear the waterways in the sea, it must take years as the unit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the high-level magicians went there, and in just a few days, they completed the task of clearing the waterway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of an additional sea transportation line, the logistics that were originally a bit difficult will soon be revived with full blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just didn't know what the orc executives would think. They carefully selected a group of elites from the army, and after paying a heavy price, they mixed into the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just started to show off, the transportation route of the human race changed again. The inland transportation in the early stage was because a large amount of strategic materials were hoarded in the inland areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the materials in stock have been consumed long ago. The Alpha Kingdom can only supply one-third of the army's logistics, and the rest comes from overseas purchases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to cut off the transportation line, unless they can go all the way from north to south, cross the Alpha Kingdom and move on, destroying all the coastal cities of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Catch the assassin!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sharp voice instantly caused chaos at the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the protagonist, Caesar III has been surrounded by guards for protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of assassins who appeared suddenly were blocked by the masters of secret guards before they could rush over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the guards who kept coming and the assassin who exposed his identity, he suffered heavy casualties in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the banquet, the five orc masters who managed to get in with great difficulty were already in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They haven't done anything yet, how did they get exposed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't panic, before the alchemy potion expires, we are no different from ordinary humans. Just look at the direction the soldiers are going, and we will know that we are not the ones who were discovered!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person headed by said forcefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's find a chance to do it, since an assassin has been exposed, the enemy will definitely conduct a strict investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how we cover up, there is still a slight gap between us and normal humans. As long as the enemy conducts an in-depth investigation, exposure is only a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he escapes this search, Caesar III will be vigilant, and it will be difficult to get close to him next time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessed an assassination in person, Caesar III had no expression on his face. This is the seventeenth time he has been assassinated since he took the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the previous assassinations were almost all discovered and resolved by the city guards before the assassination was carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the first time in his life that Caesar III was so close to the assassin. It's a pity that although these assassins were lurking well, they still exposed their identities in the moment before launching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Catch alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Caesar III finished speaking, five figures suddenly appeared and came straight to his position. In an instant, the guards who stopped in front went to meet the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Caesar III's face turned ugly. There were obviously two groups of people involved in the assassination. Compared with the guys in the front, the assassination skills of the five killers in the back were obviously much more immature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Manipulative business, can't stand strong strength. Seeing that there were fewer and fewer guards around him, Caesar III couldn't help feeling a little flustered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, take a break for now.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Grand Duke of Newfoundland's words fell, Caesar III suddenly had a dagger on his back. The one who made the move was actually a maid without any strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone could react, the maid who succeeded smiled slightly, and suddenly fell to the ground. A stream of foul-smelling blood slowly flowed out from the corner of her mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, everyone was dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one would have imagined that the maid who had been with Caesar III for many years would actually be an assassin?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally a well-prepared fishing plan, but unexpectedly caught a very poisonous catfish, and the venom sprayed out counterattacked the fisherman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when everyone was panicking, a holy light magic fell on Caesar III in time, temporarily saving his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking a closer look, Archbishop Tyron's face changed drastically, and he said in a panic: \"There is an unknown toxin on the dagger, and ordinary treatment methods are useless, you must use the forbidden spell of the light system!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister, quickly send someone to summon the high-ranking priests in the city. The rest of the people guard here first, and don't let anyone touch His Majesty's body. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland nodded immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, everyone quickly reacted. The safety of Caesar III was personally guarded by a group of bigwigs in the court. At this moment, no one could believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was going wrong, the chief guard personally led the team to attack the assassins. If you don't show up, it's over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king had an accident under his protection, and this responsibility has exceeded his ability to bear. Even if the assassin is taken down, the guilt can only be slightly mitigated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Target succeeded, withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the sound landed, not only the assassins on the field rushed out, but also dozens of figures jumped out of the crowd, fleeing frantically to the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene fell into the eyes of all the princes and ministers, and they were even more furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a diplomatic banquet, so many assassins were mixed in, it was like putting the face of the Alpha Kingdom on the ground and ravaging it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not only the princes and ministers who were flustered, but also the envoys of various countries. Many people were surprised to find that the assassin brought it in by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the \"Assassination of the Emperor\". If you can't explain it clearly and you are suspected of assassinating the emperor, you will be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only will the Alpha Kingdom not let them go, but their own king will also seek their misfortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone's biggest expectation is that Caesar III must not die. As long as people are still alive, it is just a \"king assassination case\", not a \"king killing case\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there is only one word difference, but the consequences are very different. It was my bad luck to be involved in the assassination of the king. If it turned into a murder of the king, the whole family would be implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a critical moment, a white-haired old man gritted his teeth, took out a small bottle from his arms, stepped forward and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Archbishop Tyron, it contains the water of life. Do you think it can play a role in your majesty's injury?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't be done without spending money. Although today's banquet was arranged under the leadership of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, he is the Crown Prince's deputy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Caesar III is rescued, although he will still be held accountable, but for the sake of his contribution to the water of life, at least one life can be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Archbishop Tyron grabbed the vial, opened the cork, and a strong breath of life rushed directly towards his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After checking and confirming that there was no problem, it was immediately poured into Caesar III's mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, he reached out and pulled out the dagger of Caesar III's descendants. Immediately afterwards, another spell was cast, which stopped the bleeding for the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is seriously injured, and one drop of the Water of Life is not enough. If you have collections, please donate them quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forbidden Curse of Holy Light, although the healing effect is fast, it has strong side effects. It is better not to use it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Little Caesar, I remember there are still three drops in the royal treasury. Go get it right away, if there are any omissions again, I'll take your skin off! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Tyron said with a stern look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar, who had been dumbfounded for a long time, responded hastily: \"Okay, uncle! I'll take someone to fetch it right away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a child of the royal family, he naturally heard the intention of Archbishop Tai Lun's maintenance. He didn't want the outside world to implicate him in this assassination case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he was also very speechless. This banquet was specially prepared for fishing. All the defense work was checked by him personally, and finally reported to Caesar III for approval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to mix in so many assassins was naturally agreed upon by their father and son in advance, and he deliberately pretended to be careless to lure the assassins into the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by the huge bounty offered in the underground world. Knowing that someone was buying his life, Caesar III was not one to sit still, so he deliberately set up a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity to take all precautions. I didn't expect that the maid who had been serving Caesar III for more than ten years would actually be a killer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that a maid who can serve the king must not only have an innocent background, but must also be of noble origin, and there is almost no possibility of being bribed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter has come to this point, and it is too late to regret. This wave of assassins was drawn out, but Caesar III was seriously injured, and he, the crown prince, added another \"cap of incompetence\" to his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanations are meaningless, mistakes are mistakes. The nobles have always only recognized the result, and the process is not important to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we will look at the survey results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just judging from the situation at the scene, there are several waves of assassins. God knows how many black hands are behind this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the inspection has been relaxed, all those who can appear at the banquet must be nobles, and they must be good nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many fake nobles mixed in, it would be impossible to complete without the cooperation of domestic forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This news is really shocking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were so many assassins mixed into the banquet, and the last one who succeeded was a maid, really...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no words to describe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were only a few hundred guests in a diplomatic banquet, but nearly a hundred assassins were mixed in. This is no longer an assassination, it is clearly a siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can put so many assassins in, apart from the king and crown prince, there is no third person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Caesar III had only one son, Hudson would have suspected that the crown prince wanted to kill the king and seize the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the information collected by the family, the reason why so many assassins were able to mix in this banquet was mainly because His Royal Highness the Crown Prince was negligent and did not strictly check the identities of the guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it always feels a little fake, even if the crown prince is negligent, the guards guarding the palace should not be negligent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small number of assassins who sneaked in as guests and handymen, the rest of the assassins mainly sneaked in as ministers from various countries and close followers of ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all close people, and it is impossible for these people to not find out. It is also unrealistic to say that they deliberately provided convenience to the assassins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happens, they will all be implicated. It would be fine if nothing happened to His Majesty, but if something happened, their whole family would suffer. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal for nobles to have rebels, but to say that they are all rebels would be nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Caesar III loves to toss a little bit, this does not affect that he is a wise king, and his reputation in the aristocratic circle is not low at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the big nobles don't like this kind of monarch, but the small and medium nobles support it very much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The crown prince should have nothing to do with this assassination case. I have dealt with him. Although he is a little idealized and his heart is not broad enough, he will definitely not commit regicide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the great nobles in the country, there are many people who want His Majesty to die, but almost none of them dare to kill the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination case was most likely caused by external forces, and the domestic nobles were at most contributing to the flames behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, Viscount, I don't know if you have noticed that this assassination is a bit of a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A real assassination doesn't need so many killers at all. Even if it is to disperse the strength of the guards, it is not worth sending so many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, it is too childish for a maid to injure His Majesty. The most important thing is the murder weapon, which is just a dagger for His Majesty's daily meals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are plenty of colorless and odorless poisons, and there are many poisons that kill in one blow. Why use unknown toxins?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, as a close maid, I really want to murder His Majesty. I don't think there is no better opportunity than usual. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson looked towards the direction of the capital, his eyes filled with countless doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many unreasonable things in this assassination case. Almost caught up with the case of \"Zhengde drowned, Tianqi fell into the water\" in the previous life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that the person who made the move this time does not seem to want Caesar III to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, do you think this may be His Majesty's bitter plan, and you want to use it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Viscount Oran finished speaking, Hudson hurriedly interrupted: \"Your Excellency, Viscount, this is impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, there is only one son of the Crown Prince. Even if it is a bitter trick, it will not take advantage of the reputation of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know that the crown prince's reputation in the country is very average. If he is involved in the assassination case, even if he succeeds to the throne in the future, it will be difficult to establish his prestige in the country!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really acting, those assassins alone are enough, there is no need to add superfluous and get stabbed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, Hudson suddenly understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal rhythm, there will not be so many assassins. If there are multiple forces taking action and coincidentally get together, then everything is possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two of them looked at each other, everything was kept silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the forces involved, this chaos will have a major impact on the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the newly rising challengers, turmoil in the kingdom is not terrible, what is terrible is a pool of stagnant water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, Pius VII looked at the information in his hand and showed a long-lost smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, he has not been stabbed by those kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III is undoubtedly the most active of them. If it weren't for the weak strength of the Alpha Kingdom, it is estimated that Charles III would not be the first to declare the pope illegal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ulisse, the Holy Hand did a good job this time, and kicked another stumbling block for my Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to tell the orcs that it's time for them to go. Warn them, the next scene must be acted a little bit, if there is any omission, prepare to be exterminated! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being connected with orcs doesn't mean he likes orcs. From the standpoint of the human race, the orcs are also enemies of the Holy See, but this enemy is not a threat for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Short-term cooperation, that is just their use value. When their use value was lower than the trouble they caused, Pius VII also didn't mind killing them with one kick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Caesar III was rescued and returned. Our mission...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Ulise could finish speaking, Pius VII interrupted with a smile: \"It's right that you're not dead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Caesar III really died, it would break the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A kingslayer, how could he end well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, I didn't think the rabble could get things done. If you really want to kill Caesar III, why do you need to involve the rats in the underground world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My Holy See is not short of those dead soldiers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many loopholes left, who do you think Caesar III will track down in the end?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were enemies in the first place, and they were involved in the assassination case. How long can Caesar III endure them? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See has too much hatred to overwhelm itself. It is only one assassination case, and it was not done by their own people. They can completely handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom were miserable. Caesar III could not do anything to the Holy See, but there was no shortage of means to torment them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of assassination case is messy and involves a lot of people. It's okay if we don't investigate it in depth. A lot of nobles will definitely be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassination is just a means, intensifying the internal conflicts in the Alpha Kingdom is what Pius VII wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulise was speechless. He originally wanted to say that he didn't arrange the maid killer, but now it's unnecessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't take the credit for delivering it to your door. As for the truth of the matter, there is no truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aftermath of the assassination case is still rippling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic prison in Canglan City was full for the first time since its construction. The original noble suite has now passively become a multi-person room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of grievances, complaints, and rants, but at this moment they all seem futile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the matter is investigated clearly, as a suspect, he can only stay inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king was recuperating, and the investigation of the assassination naturally fell on the crown prince and the ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, judging from the current investigation, the assassins come from multiple killer organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that someone placed a huge reward in the underground world, two million gold coins, two magic cores of sacred monsters, and an artifact of unknown function, which led to this large-scale assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After in-depth investigation, it was found that these rewards were offered by three different forces. Not long after the assassination, the reward was withdrawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All insiders were silenced, and this clue was basically broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to allow so many killers to sneak in, there are obvious loopholes in the guarding work of the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We were just about to investigate the responsibility, when suddenly 28 Guards officers and soldiers committed suicide, all of them were the guards responsible for the safety of the capital that day. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naturally, all the clues will not be cut off, but the content of the investigation is too shocking, so the clues have to be cut off for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only foreign forces were involved, but also many nobles in the kingdom. A little carelessness will be used by people with high intentions, causing unpredictable consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some clues found on the bright side, who knows if they are true or false?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Framing and framing this kind of thing is too common in political struggles. If it was deliberately arranged by the black hand behind the scenes, wouldn't it be the enemy's wish?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, this isn't the only thing we found, right? At least one of the masterminds behind the scenes is definitely an orc. Let's dig out the rest slowly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He already knew the results of the investigation, and now what is said on the table is all information after artistic processing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real situation is far more complicated than this. Many domestic nobles are suspected of participating in the assassination case. There is no evidence to prove that they are behind the scenes, but it can be inferred that they knew about it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the royal family, failure to report is betrayal. It is a pity that these messages cannot convict these people at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the involvement is so extensive that even if evidence is found, it cannot be presented now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The basis for turning around is strength. The suspected nobles together accounted for almost 40% of the kingdom's strength. Lift the lid, and the Civil War begins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is still fighting, if there is civil strife in the rear, it is not in the interests of the kingdom at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a quarrel regardless, it is still unknown where the neutral nobles will stand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the young and energetic crown prince, forbearance is a shame. Especially in this case of assassinating the king, he was labeled as incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after calming down the army, Hudson received the news that the Orc Empire was responsible for the assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic officers who had finally settled down became active one by one, clamoring for revenge for the king, which made Hudson's scalp numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn political correctness!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly complained, this is the first time he discovered that political correctness can be so disgusting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces are killing all directions in the Orc Empire. As long as you do the job well, you are making a contribution to revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One by one, they were arguing and clamoring to go to the front line, regardless of the importance of the task at hand. The officers below can mess around, but Hudson, the coach, can't. It is his responsibility to ensure the logistics of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"boom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The document in Hudson's hand was thrown heavily on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"have you had enough?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If it's not enough, you guys will continue!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You keep saying that you want to avenge His Majesty, but in fact, you don't even listen to His Majesty's orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    OK!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has grown up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to seek revenge from the orcs, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then I will fulfill you today!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adjutant, responsible for counting the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who want to go to the front line come and sign up, and I promise to send you to the front line. If you can't cut off the heads of the five great beast emperors, you don't have to come back! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Hudson's words fell to the ground, the noble officers who had been clamoring calmed down instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just shouting slogans, how can it be taken seriously?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the high-ranking military officers of the Kingdom present were present. Except for Hudson, the youngest one was in his thirties, already past the age of sophomore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, everyone just wanted to take advantage of the trend and gain some political prestige. It's a bit embarrassing to meet a serious coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they were sent to the front line and acted as the pioneers of the coalition forces, I don't know if they could avenge the king. Anyway, Caesar III can arrange their funeral affairs for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, don't we avenge His Majesty?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias stepped forward and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides have already turned their faces, and they don't care about adding an extra sum. If there is an opportunity to add obstacles to Hudson, he will naturally not give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty's order: The Kingdom's army should do a good job in logistics, ensure the supplies of the frontline army, and do not attack without authorization!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias still can't understand such a straightforward order?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jumping out in such a hurry to go against His Majesty's order, what is your intention?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to cover up, what ulterior secret? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Avenging the king is a show of loyalty, and strictly implementing the king's orders is also a show of loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A typical magic confrontation, on the issue of political correctness, both sides have played to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that Hudson is the coach, so he inherently takes more initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You...you...you are spitting blood!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said pretending to be annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the beginning, he was guilty of the assassination of Caesar III, but now that he is general Hudson, he can't keep acting this scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Hudson said sternly: \"I don't care what you think, there are military orders on the battlefield. Anyone who dares to violate the military orders will be killed without mercy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces are already doing the revenge for His Majesty. No need for some self-righteous guy to go to the front and make trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all true. Since the Orc Empire announced that it was responsible for the assassination, the coalition forces have stepped up their offensive against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many teams that want salted fish have also become busy in recent days. It is obvious that the big bosses in their respective countries have put pressure on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various documents condemning the atrocities of the orcs are now flying all over the sky, as if they will not stop until the orc empire is destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that everyone is strongly dissatisfied with the assassination of Caesar III, and they want to tilt their anger on the orcs. In fact, it is the patience of all parties, which has been worn down almost, and they want to end this war with no visible benefits as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the wallet of the Alpha Kingdom will be drained. If the war continues, it will be everyone's turn to pay together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Smart people know how to use strength, and Hudson is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the military strength of the Alpha Kingdom, it is difficult to do anything to the orcs, but it will be different if it is replaced by the human coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you are in a hurry to call us over, isn't it just to reminisce about the old days?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake asked provocatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't know the purpose of Hudson's convening of this military meeting, but based on the support of the enemy, he opposed the choice, and he had already made up his mind to sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake is worrying too much, everyone is busy with the front line every day, no matter how ignorant Hudson is, he will not come to everyone at this time to talk about the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason for inviting everyone over this time is for the upcoming war. The Alliance Council has decided to speed up the pace of the war, and everyone must have received similar orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current development of the war situation, in a short period of time, we simply do not have the ability to destroy the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So I discussed with the Marquis of Sunil, Marquis of Olafur, Duke of Danguot... and others, and concluded that the current tactics are too old and cannot meet the immediate needs of a quick solution, and a slight adjustment is necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direction of the adjustment is very simple, that is to change the current tactics of exterminating the orcs and allow the orc tribes to surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the price of accepting their surrender, the orcs must accept our adaptation and command, and contribute to the overthrow of the evil orc empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson smiled and glanced at Captain Blake, which was regarded as a counterattack to his provocation just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interfering in the command of the coalition without authorization is a political taboo. All major forces have their own independent military command, and the most annoying thing is that others stretch out their hands randomly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to change the tactics of the coalition forces, Hudson has not been idle these days. Every day, I'm either selling my own tactics, or I'm on the way to sell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the Lord of Dawn still takes care of him. After struggling with words, he finally gained the approval of a group of like-minded generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the team that agrees with the new plan expands and feels that it can change the decision of the Terran Alliance, today's proposal was made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, this new combat mode, I have communicated with Earl Hudson in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We agree that the current style of play requires too much loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After comprehensive analysis of various tactics, we finally found out the best way to reduce the loss of the army - use orcs to fight orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been on the front line for so long, it is estimated that everyone has discovered it. The orcs are called a clan, but they are actually composed of multiple races, and the blood and blood feud between them is no less shallow than that of our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we promise: support these cannon fodder races to rule the Orc Empire after the war, they will stand up and join us in destroying the evil Orc Empire! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil added along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The method of combat is not important, the key is to be able to reduce your own losses. Using orcs to consume orcs is much more worry-free than using your own family to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how heavy the casualties are, there is no need to worry about follow-up troubles. When he returned home, he would only be greeted with flowers and applause, not a group of crying family members of the nobles who died in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Sunil, according to your opinion, the orc empire still belongs to the orcs, and we are only equivalent to replacing them with a ruler.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone mobilized the people and came here from a long distance, for the foundation of our human race, not to help the orcs change their dynasties! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captain Blake mocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right or wrong is not important, now oppose for the sake of opposing. No matter how good the other party's reasons are, he must persist to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake doesn't need to worry, if they want to master the orc empire after the war, they have to live until after the war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they survived by luck, the big deal is to just draw a piece of land for them and let them rebuild the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We only promised to support them in ruling the orc empire, but we didn't promise what kind of orc empire we would give them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one stipulated that the orc empire must have a population of over 100 million. Tribes of a few hundred can be called empires if we like.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many orc races, and one family counts as a family. As long as they are willing to join them, they can give them an orc empire and let them close the door and enjoy themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are not enough, one tribe and one orc empire can also be discussed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire has a vast territory, and we don't need to eat it all. It is enough to take away the southern prairie, and the remaining areas can be assigned to them to establish an independent country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget about the Ula Mountains in the central part, there is a paradise for monsters, and they used to only feed monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think the Nikolai Plateau in the north and the Salar Hills in the west are both good, and it is no problem to arrange thousands of \"orc empires\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just to reassure the hearts of all races in the mainland and let them know: our human race will not kill all other races! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur's words shocked Blake a lot. The collusion between the Kingdom of Frank and the Kingdom of Alpha has already driven the Holy See crazy. When will the Kingdom of Iberia join in?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three most powerful kingdoms on the mainland are close together, what about the Holy See?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even worse is that there seems to be a string of kingdoms behind, which also support this plan. Nothing was done, and the Holy See was isolated by these kingdoms again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the matter, Blake knows it without thinking about it. A group of small countries who are used to doing things on the wall can only support the proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else, he is the only opponent. Even the few countries that are secretly controlled by the Holy See will not stand with him as the opposition at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tactical adjustment of the Terran Allied Forces directly affected the strategic deployment of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the coalition forces no longer slaughtered and turned to political inducement to surrender, the resistance of the orcs was instantly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless orc tribes were \"voluntarily\" defected after the human coalition forces approached the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the transformation, he immediately acted as the pioneer of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small number of diehards who were extremely hostile to the human race were soon forced to meet the beast **** under this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the careful training of the five royal families of the orcs, the hard-headed orc tribes have become history, and the rest are smart \"beasts\" who know how to advance and retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hand with big cake + one hand with big stick, at this moment, the racial talent of the coalition forces is full. A group of nobles came to the stage one after another to show off their big tricks of painting cakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of the Leading Party, the advance speed of the coalition forces has become even faster. The pressure came directly to the orc royal court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The allied forces of the human race are crazy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear King roared almost roaring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human coalition forces are pressing every step of the way, and the younger brothers are constantly defecting, which makes him feel the crisis of genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult for the human race alone to destroy the five royal families, but it would be hard to say if someone from the orc empire cooperates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things, once the opening is opened, it can never be closed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Xionghuang, calm down first. We have considered this worst situation beforehand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those races are not of one mind with us. When the human race stops killing them, surrender will become the norm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the cunning humans promised to support them in rebuilding the orc empire. With the brains of those idiots, it's only a problem not to be fooled! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagle Emperor spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the sadness between the eyebrows, which proves that he is not as optimistic as he said. Many things can be resolved without being anticipated in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is playing Yangmou, but any orc tribe with a little ambition will know how to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they knew that the human race was taking them as cannon fodder, everyone still couldn't resist the temptation. Who let them hang out with the five royal families, and they are also cannon fodder?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he was destined to be cannon fodder, he naturally chose a generous master to join him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making military exploits, the five royal families can at most allocate a piece of pasture for them, but the human race can directly give them a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps after these races grow up, they will become a new threat to the human race in the future, but that is also a problem for the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All countries are easy to split, but difficult to unify. A single race can still be divided because of interests, let alone a mixed empire composed of different races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of Hudson's splitting method, all the orc races went to establish independent countries, and in the future there will be a spectacle of thousands of countries in the northern part of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you provoke them, the orc races that are already in the food chain will not be able to stop unless you fight to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least for decades, no orc race can have the strength to unify all races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor, thanks to such a big incident, you can still sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't do something, we're doomed. If you let me know which **** came up with the dirty trick, I will take his soul out and burn it for ten thousand years!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Xiong, there is no need to look for it. You are also familiar with that **** who came up with dirty tricks, and he is now at the top of the empire's reward list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have offered a reward for 100,000 sheep, 30,000 cows, and 1,000 slaves... Do you want to add more rewards? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said half-jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life is hard, but there is always life. If you don't find some fun for yourself, you will collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone's laughter is high, even though they know it's a joke, or only the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor is laughing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to laugh out loud is naturally because the core members of the Yinyue Wolf Clan completed the transfer first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining werewolf tribes are mainly ordinary werewolves, and only a very small number of bloodlines have returned to their ancestors to be eligible to become a member of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, no kidding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my opinion, the current situation in the empire is far from as bad as you imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems very simple for the human race to split up the empire, but the premise of all this is the decline of our five families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our strength is preserved, even if the enemy splits the orc empire, we can unite the empire again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the competition is patience. As long as our clansmen have completed the transfer, we can slowly spend with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the human race coalition forces have been stationed on the grassland, after they leave, we can fight back at any time and take back everything that belongs to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this opportunity must be grasped well, and we must pass the limelight before talking about it, and we can no longer stimulate the human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said with lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    learn from mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having personally experienced the power of the human race, he has completely given up on the position of the overlord of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor is right. The situation is not yet time to be pessimistic. This wave of human offensive seems to be very fierce, but in fact it also indicates that the end of the war is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination of Caesar III has lifted the cover of the power struggle in the Alpha Kingdom. The struggle that was originally kept in the dark has now been brought to the fore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal conflicts alone are enough for him to keep busy. No matter how much he wants to destroy us, he must first settle the internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Caesar III could graciously express that he would not pursue the matter, he would have to have the confidence of those big nobles. Now that the seeds of doubt have been planted, both sides have to lose one side to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the insistence of this main combat faction, the already vacillating Terran Alliance will soon be shaken in its determination to destroy us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keep dragging on, and the heavy logistics will overwhelm them. We have a lot of time to grind, the big deal is to give them the prairie first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex pretended to be proud and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, he had greeted the entire Hudson family. It's really too bad, it's obvious that they want to kill the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were not many vassal tribes as resources to continuously provide them with supplies and wealth, the life of the five royal families would not be so nourishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

His face was rosy, and he didn't look like someone who had been seriously injured at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one mentioned anything about the assassination case. After the Orc Empire declared that it was responsible for this, the Alpha Kingdom officials also directly identified it as the orc.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who were suspected of participating were released one after another after a series of investigations because there was no real evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything returned to normal, as if nothing happened, but the undercurrent became more and more turbulent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one thought that Caesar III would swallow his anger after such a big thing happened. The more there is no attack, the more panicked everyone is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the nobles who were suspected of participating, even the big shots in the court were nervous, lest this fire would burn on their own heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tension filled the air, but Caesar III remained unmoved. The search for the real culprit has come to a halt, and no one has been held accountable, including the officer in charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you all read the battle report from the front line? The speed of the army's advancement is very good. It seems that our Earl of Hudson has worked hard this time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III's half-smiley words confused everyone. Is this satisfied with Hudson or not?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking that they didn't understand the king's true thoughts, everyone dared not answer easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knew that Caesar III was simmering with anger and urgently needed a chance to vent, and no one wanted to touch this bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why don't you talk anymore, isn't the frontline fighting well?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that there was no way to escape, the Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Alfiero, replied anxiously: \"Your Majesty, the battlefield is volatile. It is naturally great that Earl Hudson can think of using orcs to control orcs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he has a good relationship with Hudson. If he wants to help speak out, as the Minister of Military Affairs, he must give a fair and objective evaluation in order to convince everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is military or political, using orcs to deal with orcs is in the interests of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only flaw lies in this strategic plan, which came out too late. If it was used earlier, it would be another scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is not a reason to criticize and accuse. It is already very remarkable to be able to come up with such a countermeasure and promote it in time among the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, tell Earl Hudson to make persistent efforts. Be sure to teach the orcs a hard lesson in the shortest possible time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Caesar III immediately caused an uproar in Qun's mind. Every word of the monarch is inevitably subject to political interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a \"lesson\", not total destruction. Obviously Caesar III has shaken his determination to destroy the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when encountering such important matters that determine the future destiny of the kingdom, he would discuss with everyone first, but now he is acting arbitrarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of the assassination finally began to ferment. No matter how he acted on the surface, Caesar III was still pierced with a thorn in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe not for everyone, but for the nobles suspected of participating, Caesar III must have lost trust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes in the court directly affected the front line. In recent days, Hudson has clearly felt the strangeness in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the prestige accumulated during this period, he can only barely ensure that the troops complete the tasks on time, and more of them have exceeded his ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, has the struggle for the royal capital started so soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The intelligence network of the Koslow family has just started and has not yet penetrated into the court. To understand the situation in the capital, Hudson had to rely on the strength of his father-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also an equivalent exchange. The Hollisle family provided him with information, and Hudson also used his power to provide them with convenience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It hasn't broken the skin yet, but judging from the current situation, the outbreak is coming soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In advance so early, in addition to the previous assassination, the more important thing is that in this war, the kingdom has gained too much benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The new defense line in the northern border was built by you alone. You should know how much land the kingdom has harvested this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now as long as the orcs are seriously injured, this part of the benefits can be eaten by us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the country are gearing up, wanting to get a share of it. Next, a battle between dragons and tigers is inevitable! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the general situation, the Holliser family is vulnerable. Originally thinking of using this war to re-emerge, he even decided on the direction of development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately something went wrong at the last minute. During the breakout battle, the kingdom's standing army suffered heavy losses, and the strength of the Holliser family in the army was naturally also severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, this was nothing. All the great nobles lost together, which means that no one was injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the family private army he worked so hard to build was also brought into the gutter by Earl Pierce, and the entire army was almost wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time he thinks of this, he can't help but look at Hudson enviously. People with great luck are different. Others have suffered heavy losses in wars, but the Koslow family has become stronger and stronger in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Koslow family, which was at the bottom of the middle-class nobles, directly stepped into the ranks of the great nobles under the leadership of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he is his own son-in-law, otherwise he very much doubts whether he will be jealous enough to doubt life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, rest assured, no matter how much trouble they make, they will have our share, it's just a matter of the size of the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the background of the Holliser family and the harvest this time, it should not be a big problem to return to the ranks of the great nobles. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most important ally of the family now, the Holliser family must be stabilized. Otherwise, even after entering the circle of great nobles, there is not even a guide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountains are about to rain and the wind is full!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the order from the king, Hudson made a decisive decision-selective execution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to fight the orcs, but the prerequisite is to preserve strength first. As the commander-in-chief of the army, now he can only continue to win and cannot have any major defeats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Hudson can do, he has already done it. Not only has it become famous within the kingdom, but it has gained a lot of popularity even if it looks at the entire Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps after countless years, he may also be deified and become one of the few epic heroes in the history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I hope! The military achievements of the Holliser family are still lacking. Even if all the connections are mobilized, there is no obvious advantage compared to the competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, let's see if we can create an opportunity later, let us go...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor condition, short and weak.

Don't look at how fast the coalition forces are advancing now, if it's really our people, I'm afraid it will be another situation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has become frightened, and it is impossible to let them be careless and divide their troops at will. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to create combat opportunities, but the problem is that as far as the remnants of the Holliser family are concerned, a Beamon cavalry regiment can wipe them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including members of the Koslow family, he did not deliberately arrange the task of earning military exploits. Not only because Hudson needs to be fair and strict, but also because he cannot afford unexpected losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities are reserved for those with strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am too greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, just pretend I didn't say anything. The current Holliser family can no longer stand the toss. If they lose the last family property in their hands, no matter how great the military exploits are, it will be useless! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said with lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, he realized how dangerous his thoughts were. If you go to the battlefield when your strength is weak, no matter how good the fighter is, you will not be able to grasp it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like Hudson's strategy of \"using beasts to control beasts and splitting the orc empire\", it was clearly planned by himself, but in the end he shared it with the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't want to eat alone, it's because the kingdom's army has a limited stomach and cannot swallow this cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson was appointed as the coach before the Northern Expeditionary Army suffered heavy losses, there would be nothing wrong with the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A piece of military exploits that can become the \"Marshal of the Human Race\", let it go out as soon as it is said, this kind of decisiveness that is not procrastinating, made the Viscount Oran admire him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Viscount, don't worry too much. Now the situation faced by each family is similar, and the Holliser family is not at a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What determines the distribution of benefits after the war is essentially no longer on the battlefield, but more on the upcoming political game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination case put the dispute in the capital on the table. Those big nobles involved are the ones His Majesty will suppress next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the five major families of the Northern Lands, who already had grievances with the royal family, but now that new and old grudges are added together, His Majesty will never spare them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holliser family is willing to give up their current foundation and come to northern Xinjiang, obtain the fiefdoms of several counties, and take charge of the power of a province, it will be no problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, benefits and risks are directly proportional. Even without the threat of orcs, the conditions in the northern border area were not as good as those in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To develop these lands, the manpower, material resources, and financial resources required are astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, the Koslow family decided to stay in the southeastern province. After the war, at most, they would only try to take back the ancestral land from the Lochnard family. Even if the other areas of northern Xinjiang were given to me, the Koslow family would not be able to develop them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson analyzed rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what choice the Holliser family makes, he will support it, but the Koslow family will not go north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to going to the north to start over, he would rather stay in the southeastern province and fight with the Dalton family. It's not that Hudson has no ambitions, it's that the family background is too shallow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core factor is population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the branches of the Koslow family are evacuated and all the connections that can be used are used, at most hundreds of thousands of people can be gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small population, the land of a county can be settled. Even if it is a little bit reluctant, at most it will eat the land of two or three counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of moving these people there alone can bankrupt Hudson. Instead of rushing forward blindly, he might as well nest in the mountainous area and smash into the swamp behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the mountainous territories are earning money. Even if the war is over, the annual income is not low. With a little effort, you can make ends meet and embark on a positive cycle of developing the territory with the income from the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I'm afraid your plan will be difficult to achieve. The ancestral land of the Koslow family is in the hands of the Lochnard family, and they will not hand it over as a last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the Northland are united in the same spirit, and their situations are all similar, so they will not see such precedents appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family will also try their best to send you to the Northland. With their influence among the nobles in the southeastern provinces, most of the nobles in the seven southeastern provinces will support them politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You rise too fast, beyond the capacity of all parties. After the war, they will inevitably find ways to limit your development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because you made a decisive move before and made most of the nobles in the kingdom owe favors. Otherwise, what the Koslow family is facing is not restricting development, but suppression from all sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Holliser family is not much better. Although we used to be old aristocrats, there are not many who are willing to see us go back to the old relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we have been in business for countless years, we can only keep most of the great nobles in the kingdom neutral. Politically, it's hard to support you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran replied with a wry smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Koslow family is willing to go to the Northland, then the Hollisle Family can also recruit several other middle-level nobles in the kingdom to form a group to build a foundation in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Hudson as a powerful thug, even if they teamed up with several other families, the Holliser family could not compete with the five major families in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, rest assured, judging from the current situation, it will take several years at the earliest for the Dalton family to restore their peak military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If other factors are considered, the recovery period will be longer. Before that, they were just giving me political trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a big deal. After the war, I will go back and concentrate on managing the fief, and will not participate in the disputes of the court. Anyway, they dare not provoke a military conflict! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The halo of famous generals is used at this time. A name alone can deter many enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without full confidence, he had to be careful when playing outside the game, lest he, the \"young and vigorous famous general\", be irritated, and directly overturn the table and drag the Dalton family to die together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As long as you know what's in your mind!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said enviously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has the strength to pull the Dalton family to the end. No matter how bad the situation is, it can't get worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large families can pass on through the ages, and what they compete for is long-term, and they rarely act on their own will. Unless it is absolutely necessary, he will not easily overturn the table and gamble the entire family's wealth and lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the situation on the battlefield worsened, the five royal families of the orcs also accelerated their pace of retreat. In a hurry, they don't even care about the health of the elderly, women and children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many tribes experienced a large number of attrition during the evacuation. Even though the priests tried their best to treat them, they still couldn't prevent the tragedy from happening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After chasing and fleeing, the battle line was quickly pulled to the edge of the orc prairie. At this moment, the five royal families of orcs have retreated to the Nicholas Plateau in the north and the Salar Hills in the west.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal contradictions that were originally covered up gradually intensified. The barren west and north cannot afford so many orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without many orc races to exploit, not only did the orc nobles lose their luxurious life in the past, but even the daily supplies of many small and medium-sized tribes became difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opposition to evacuation, calls to fight out to regain lost ground, are also rising in the Orc Empire, causing the five emperors a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is the consumption of materials while sitting on the mountain. Just experienced a big migration, many tribes are divided into raw land, it is difficult to have a large output in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also many loopholes in the organization. Many farming tribes were classified into plateaus that were not suitable for agricultural planting; some nomadic tribes were also classified into mountainous areas that were not suitable for large-scale grazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officials sent by the imperial court are either wrangling with the tribes below, or on the way to wrangling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the problem of material distribution, many tribes even fought. Even if it was forcibly suppressed, the seeds of hatred were planted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is a bit bad, and our prior estimates were insufficient. The land in the western and northern regions is barren, and it is difficult to feed too many people. The clansmen are now complaining and complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, I'm afraid I won't be able to suppress it later! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the family with the best preserved strength among the five royal families, the lion clan has retained the largest core population, and also encountered the greatest trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a large enough land is allocated, it is difficult to meet the actual needs now. In order to ensure supplies, they have even started hunting other orc races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lion King, don't worry too much. This kind of hard life won't last for too long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are under a lot of pressure now, and the pressure from the Terran Alliance is equally high. Opening the map, one can see that it is thousands of miles away from Fengyue Port to here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the transfer of materials from the rear is added, the daily consumption of materials by the human race is also an extremely huge number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary human soldier fighting on the front line must invest at least five times the manpower to transport supplies in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, the current main source of military expenditure for the Terran Allied Forces is still provided by the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To maintain the consumption of millions of troops on the front line, the daily expenses are astronomical. I don't think Alpha Kingdom's financial resources can last for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military subsidy of the Terran Allied Forces to the army has been increased to 20%. If the war continues, this ratio will continue to climb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few human nations in the North that have blood feuds with us. Most of the human race countries participated in this war only because of racial interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom will bear the military expenses in the front, they are just helping the scene, so there is no big problem. Now it's my turn to pay for it, and I have more ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we only need to beat the human coalition forces to make them realize that we are not easy to bully, and this war should be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, we must also grasp the degree of it. It is necessary to make the human race feel pain, but not to stimulate the glassy heart of their mainland overlord! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the sparse population, compared to the other four royal families, the logistics pressure of the Beamon family has become the smallest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the evacuation was completed first, the seized land was basically good, and most of the clansmen were properly resettled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, less material pressure does not mean that Alex has less mental pressure. As Emperor Bimon, he hasn't had a few days of comfortable life since he succeeded to the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, apart from scolding his dead father, he was worried about the future fate of the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it easily, but deep down he knew very well that it was easy to give up the orc prairie, but it was not easy to get it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race can organize a coalition once, and then they can organize a second time. The newly occupied orc prairie is the face of the continent's overlord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the future can be slowly abandoned, but in a short period of time, the human race must be held in the hands to prove the achievements of the contemporary monarchs to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overlord's face + the monarch's personal name before and after his life. Anyone who dares to touch this taboo will be severely beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Bimon, your thinking is too simple. If you want to hurt the human coalition forces, and you can't sweep the face of the human race, how can you fight this battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, the Terran coalition forces now have the upper hand. Even if we pull the battle line to the current position, we are still at a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to reverse the situation, you have to put them in first, find a way to dismantle them, and then use the terrain to slowly consume them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Damn the Holy See of Dawn, since we declared responsibility for the Assassin case, they have cut off contact with us, and their previous promises may not be able to be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can support us is the joint pressure of all ethnic groups on the mainland. It's a pity that the dragon we bought was unreliable, and was seen through by the human race early on. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The allies are unreliable, and the orc empire, fighting alone, has reached the time of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defection of a large number of cannon fodder has put a strain on the strength of the five royal families. The drudgery that was originally undertaken by the cannon fodder race can only be done by their own people now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc race, which has always been oppressed, has become the vanguard to attack them under the dual drive of hatred and interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That dragon is still of some value, he offered to help contact the Shanghai people if he could add more money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, we still have to rely on ourselves if we want to get the help of the Sea Clan and cut off the sea transportation line of the Human Clan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingren Emperor said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to find the Sea Clan, but the question is, why should the Sea Clan help them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Creatures in the sea, except for a few amphibians, are not suitable for survival on land. Even if they can occupy the entire Aslant continent, it doesn't mean much to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the Sea Clan invaded the mainland, mostly because of their beliefs. Now that the gods are not manifesting their holiness, and there is no order from the oracle, everyone will naturally not be full and looking for excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interest stimulus?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving the entire continent to others may not necessarily be interested in them. After all, if you swim well in the water, no fish or shrimp wants to become a salted fish or a salted shrimp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, there are local conflicts with the mainland races, which are revenge caused by provoking the nearby sea tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Now I can't give an accurate answer, I can only tell you that the logistics department has done its best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the nearest Fengyue Port is more than 1,500 miles away from the front line. It would be fine if they were all plains, but now they have entered the mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poor natural environment and muddy roads, together with the destruction of the orcs, are all important factors affecting logistics transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now that it is raining continuously, it has increased the difficulty of transportation. After the weather improves, the transportation speed should be able to speed up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the dramatic changes in the terrain, the logistics of the coalition forces began to have problems. Delays in the distribution of strategic materials are common.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original half-monthly release has now become once a month. Even the requisition of materials, from the initial door-to-door delivery, to now each army has to send its own people to the transfer station to collect them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and all that the Alpha Kingdom can mobilize has been mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson still lacks manpower in his hands. In order to ensure the timely supply of logistical materials, he even proposed to the kingdom to outsource part to the caravan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chambers of commerce that are currently active in the Orc Empire come here with a full load of strategic materials, but they still cannot meet the needs of the frontline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the transportation of supplies is slow, don't you know what to do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake asked again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there was no deliberate targeting, the Holy See still suffered a lot in the distribution of logistical materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics transfer station is always relatively far from their location. Every time I receive supplies, I have to run hundreds of miles recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing controversial, pure luck. Who made the Holy See distrust the logistics department and was unwilling to provide the army's offensive route in advance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Holy See refused to provide it, Hudson could only pretend not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other troops are usually tens of miles away from the transfer station, and the farthest will not exceed two hundred miles. The only exception is the army of the Holy See, which is often transported over long distances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of smooth logistics and material support, this distance is nothing. But now the logistics are gradually unable to keep up with the speed of the army, which is a great disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accidents often occur during transportation, and there is no guarantee that all supplies will arrive according to the quota. Some materials have a large loss, and some materials have a small loss, and they are not controllable by manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearby troops took away the supplies first. For the Holy See army, it depends on what is left in the warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luck eats meat, bad luck eats bran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the hole was dug by himself. Blakela had no shame in sending the marching route over, so he could only complain about the lack of logistics support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course there is a way, but the cost is a bit high. Captain Blake, you know that the kingdom is exhausted by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See can provide more support, we will immediately increase the number of mercenaries to ensure the supply of materials on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the kingdom is well prepared, and the army will not be short of supplies in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the orc prairie, we have already stockpiled enough supplies for the army to consume for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem now is that it cannot be shipped. Even though you are only a few hundred miles away from the orc prairie, the food we transported will consume 35% of the consumption of this distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning. As the front advances, more and more supplies will be consumed halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics force is short of manpower. In the rear kingdom, men, women, and children are already fighting together, and cannot provide more civilians for the front line. Now I can only ask you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson solemnly bowed to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Hudson is conflicted. He not only wants to solve the orc threat once and for all, but also wants to end this endless war as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persisting until now, the predicament was put on the table, because the kingdom did not want to let go of this opportunity to severely damage or even destroy the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice now is to completely drag the Human Race Alliance into the water. Unleash the power of the entire human race and wipe the orcs from the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson's tricks are not strong enough to fool all the old foxes. The main reason is that the rest of the orc empire is rotten land, which is really unattractive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the relatively fertile orc prairie is unsalable at auction, let alone these rotten lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since occupying the orc prairie and stepping into the northwest region, the desire of the coalition forces to fight has declined sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the richness of the prairie, the orc tribes in the Northwest are poorer than the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by insufficient resources, when the local tribe develops to a certain extent, it will be automatically split. Most of them exist in the form of small tribes, and there are very few tribes with more than 3,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is so poor that there is no hope for loot or anything. If you want to make a fortune now, you can only head-to-head with the main force of the orcs of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, the human coalition forces chased the orcs, it was easy. But the situation changed when entering the mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the natural cover provided by nature, aerial reconnaissance is no longer omnipotent, and the orcs also have the ability to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not much loot was won. On some battlefields, the human coalition forces were ambushed several times by the orcs taking advantage of the terrain, and suffered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the battle at this point, the Terran Alliance can declare a complete victory to the outside world. Anyway, the benefits are gone, and the face of the human race has also been recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current battle, to put it nicely, means that everyone uses troops cautiously;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the large number of orc cannon fodder troops in everyone's hands, which have not been consumed, it is estimated that someone has proposed to withdraw the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way. In order to attract the orc Hanhan to join the group, everyone has given too many promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to Hudson's proposal to support a group of orc races to establish their own country independently, in the process of specific operations, some more operations were added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they can't keep their promises, and they can't openly breach the contract, then they can only be sent to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Non-my family, its heart must be different!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively chose not to see this unscrupulous practice of everyone, and let everyone toss about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone has seen the contributions of the Alpha Kingdoms, and it has indeed reached its limit to be able to send so many supplies to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson's proposal, I think it can be considered. Either we send more people, or spend money to hire more mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current orc tribes are mostly entrenched in the mountains and forests. They are often not suitable for large armies, but more suitable for mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only in terms of logistics, more mercenaries can be used; when it comes to the battlefield, we can also introduce mercenaries to participate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this war, although the orcs took the initiative to invade, it was Charles III who pushed for a comprehensive counterattack in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a political commander-in-chief, Marquis Sunil knew very well that this was the first war launched by the outside world after his boss came to power, and he had to win beautifully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the results, it is now possible to choose to end. But from the perspective of the process, it is far from meeting the psychological expectations of the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting all the way, the coalition forces seemed to be sweeping all over the world, but in fact they didn't even have a significant victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What everyone can do, naturally cannot highlight the power of the First Kingdom on the mainland. But wanting to win big, the enemy is unwilling to cooperate, and Marquis Sunil is also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't show off the kingdom's military power, but you can barely make do with showing off the command ability of the kingdom's generals. He managed to **** this errand from a crowd of competitors, so he couldn't make a trip in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Sunil's proposal is very pertinent, fighting in the jungle, mercenaries are professionals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those mercenary regiments that have been active in areas such as Warcraft Mountains and Elven Forests for a long time are the best among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this war, the mercenaries also made significant contributions. I think the alliance can raise a sum of money to reward the head of the orc royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For mercenaries who have made great contributions, we can also consider appropriate titles and rewards! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately echoed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the method is, as long as it can severely damage the orc empire, he will support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil can propose to let mercenaries join the war, so Hudson will naturally confirm the proposal. Anyway, the Alpha Kingdom has no money now, and the money can only be paid by the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title reward, that would be even better. The land under their feet is a ready-made fiefdom, enough to accommodate countless new nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, it's easy for you to say! Using a large number of mercenary regiments will increase military expenditures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, mercenaries vary from good to bad, and it's okay to do odd jobs along with them. It's a joke to expect them to be the main force in combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance's money is not blown away by strong winds, we can't squander it like this! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Captain Blake finished speaking, he felt a murderous aura coming from behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reacting, he scolded himself for being stupid, and was so busy refuting Hudson that he forgot that there were members of the mercenary guild here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the words have already been spoken, and it's too late to take them back. As a representative of the Holy See, even if he said something wrong, he is not allowed to apologize on this occasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mere mercenary guild, whose comprehensive strength can only rank in the mid-range among the many major forces of the human race, is not worthy of his bow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The proposals of Marquis Sunil and Earl of Hudson are very good. In the coming war, we can fully play the role of mercenaries to a greater extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about financial issues. It is a matter of the righteousness of the human race. I believe that the mercenary regiments all over the mainland will not be so morally inferior that they will take advantage of the situation and rob them at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone agrees, our mercenary guild can publish it for free without taking any commission. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adolf said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of the entire mercenary world was at stake, and he, the representative, had to stand up. It's a pity that the power of the Holy See is too great, after all, he dare not offend the Holy See too deeply, and the counterattack is seriously insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, you are too picky. There are indeed many scum among the mercenaries, but they are only a very small part after all. Most of the mercenary groups are worthy of recognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, Captain Adolf, when the human race was in crisis, he immediately led the team to support, which is enough to prove their enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think everyone should discuss as soon as possible, come up with a specific implementation plan, and report it to the Human Race Council for approval. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having turned against the Holy See a long time ago, Hudson would naturally not show mercy if he had the opportunity to attack their reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the fire broke out, the tension between the Holy See and the Mercenary Guild was completely settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe you won't turn your face on the bright side, but secretly holding grudges is indispensable. Maybe at some point, the Holy See will be able to suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Lord Maxim, this is the reward we have prepared. I don't know when we can contact the Sea Clan?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elder Yingman asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeking help from the Sea Clan, no one knows if it will work, but you have to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the way back, the Terran coalition forces are still hot on their heels. Judging by that posture, he was not ready.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the Holy See, as long as the human race wins a big battle to satisfy the purpose of the major forces of the human race to show off their force, the coalition forces will return home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of unreliable information, the five emperors simply don't believe it. The human race has always been cunning, what if they spend all their money to cooperate with them in a fight, and finally turn their faces and deny them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have never happened in history. Rather than entrusting fate to others, it is better to control it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Xiaoying. Benlong is doing business, so there is nothing to worry about. Isn't it just contacting the Sea Clan, what a big deal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You wait here. After I pack up my things, I will take you there to meet the people of the Sea Clan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, I saw the dragon tail flicking all the treasures in the cave, rolling them up and sending them into the giant mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head can be broken, the blood can be shed, but the treasure cannot be lost. Every gold coin in the dragon's hands is their life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't feel safe to put it anywhere, only by swallowing it into the space in the abdomen can the dragon feel at ease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he was in the cave, Maxim disliked the old man's flying speed too slowly, grabbed him with one claw, and galloped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Free rides are not easy to ride. The lightning speed caused the old man Ying to faint in the air. Obviously, flying races cannot afford such super speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying all the way to the surface of the sea, looking at the rough waves, Maxim stopped suddenly: \"Oops! It seems that they were robbed too hard last time, and this group of murlocs didn't wait for the great Lord Maxim to come over. Just move away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Maxim's words, the eagle-eyed old man who just woke up fainted again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of him was a dizzy dragon, but now he is simply stunned by anger. Thinking that he was so wise in his lifetime, he would actually believe the nonsense of a red dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to Maxim boasting that he has friendship with the Sea Clan, he can draw a line from him. I didn't expect that the so-called friendship is to have robbed the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
