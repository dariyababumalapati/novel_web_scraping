A year ago, Hudson would not have dared to do it so ostentatiously.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     It is different now. Under the banner of developing the Near East, some slightly out-of-line behaviors can be accepted by everyone.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The previous method of selecting elite soldiers, teaching them the method of cultivating fighting spirit, and screening out soldiers with the qualifications to cultivate, is now obviously unable to meet the requirements.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Hudson had already completed the military's aptitude test in private, and all soldiers who were qualified to practice had received the practice methods.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     It was a pity that there were too few people with the qualifications to practice, and even fewer with good talents. After screening the tens of thousands of troops in the territory, including a group of reserve soldiers, there were only more than 4,000 people with the qualifications to practice, and only half of them were worth training.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"google-auto-placed ap_container\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <ins class=\"adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1074058122108724\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor: transparent;\">\n    <div data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-left=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-right=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-border-top=\"\" id=\"aswift_4_host\" style=\"border: none; height: 280px; width: 1200px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block; --darkreader-inline-border-top: none; --darkreader-inline-border-right: none; --darkreader-inline-border-bottom: none; --darkreader-inline-border-left: none; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor: transparent;\">\n    </div>\n   </ins>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This ratio is far lower than that of the children of nobles.

It is similar to selecting seeds. The seeds with the largest and fullest grains are likely to produce crops with better yield and quality.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The fathers of noble children awakened their talent for cultivation, and the essence of their lives was sublimated.
