The body can't lie, the weird scene made Li Mu swallow the words that came to his lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of me really doesn't look like filming. As a prank, that's even more impossible. As an ordinary salaryman, Li Mu didn't think that anyone would make such a big scene for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crossover!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea came to mind, a strange memory spewed out of his mind, before he could struggle, Li Mu fainted magnificently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pastor Quinn, how is the situation in Hudson?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A middle-aged man in gorgeous clothes asked with concern. Beside him was a lady with red and swollen eyes, waiting for the answer with a rather complicated expression. There are expectations and resentment, but they are well hidden, looking like a mother who cares about her son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Baron Redman. God will bless his followers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of backlash was successfully cleared, and Master Hudson has awakened the seed of life, but the energy consumption is too large, and he fainted temporarily. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pastor Quinn said a little tiredly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he did not perform the healing technique easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him just a junior pastor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as long as he is a priest, he is a high-level talent, at least in Tielun Town.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the only priest and pharmacist in the territory, Pastor Quinn is still very prestigious. Usually, when he sees a doctor, he uses the medicine he made up to make up for it, and he does experiments by the way. Only the most important people in the territory are worthy of his magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Great Lord of Dawn bless Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you Pastor Quinn...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said a little excitedly, and the sadness on his face instantly disappeared without a trace. If it weren't for the cultivation of the nobility, I'm afraid the performance would be even more exaggerated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off the pastor, Baron Redman turned around and told the maid: \"Take care of Hudson, and notify me immediately when he wakes up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe seeing that Baron Redman's mood improved, the lady beside him couldn't help pleading: “Redman, since Hudson is fine, should we put poor Lesser down first?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if he had been poked in the sore foot, Baron Redman, who was originally in a good mood, instantly became clouded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up! You spoiled it all. You secretly exchanged your brother's life essence, and passed on the thousand-year reputation of my Koslow family, all of which have been ruined by this bastard!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson's fate, I would have killed this beast. Let him hang on, who dares to let him down, hum...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tears are a woman's most powerful weapon. If it was normal, Baron Redman would have already retreated, but everything is different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Baron Redman walked away without saving the baroness at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the hospital bed, Li Mu, who was slowly waking up with the memory of the original owner fused, finally confirmed that he was not dreaming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he saved the universe in his previous life, and he caught up with such a lucky thing in time travel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, Li Mu would rather go back and continue 996. Time-traveling or whoever likes to come, just come!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson Koslow\", the third son of Baron Redman, is Li Mu's new identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, although this background is not rich and powerful, it is also something that he could not strive for in his previous life. If you work hard with this as the starting point, you will not worry about not having a wonderful life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this world is not normal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the political structure is somewhat similar to that of medieval Europe, it is only an appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight, magic, priest, wizard...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elves, dwarves, orcs, sea people, undead...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occupations and races that only exist in games and novels are all real in front of us now, so this world is doomed not to be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accustomed to the peace of modern society, suddenly came to a chaotic world of \"the strong prey on the weak\", no one can adapt to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being afraid of pain, Li Mu didn't have the courage to try to die. After struggling in the hospital bed all night, he reluctantly accepted the fact that he had become \"Hudson Koslow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Set a small goal first - to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world where religion is rampant and mixed with mythology, any abnormal behavior may lead to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to get on the grill, Hudson's identity must be maintained. Everything else is easy to handle, but words, deeds and behavior habits are not so easy to imitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson didn't know whether to be grateful or resent the cheap brother who was still hanging on the pillar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for that unlucky Tie Hanhan who secretly replaced the original owner's life essence, it probably wouldn't be his turn to occupy the magpie's nest, and he might have escaped this time through time travel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also benefited from this accident, which provided him with the perfect excuse. After experiencing the great stimulation of life and death crisis, the behavior and habits have changed, which makes sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sorting out the messy memories in his mind, Hudson had a preliminary understanding of his situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The third son of Baron Redman, he has two older brothers and one older sister, and three younger brothers and two younger sisters. The tragedy is that the baron's wife is now the second.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's the same in ancient and modern China and abroad. When you meet your stepmother, you can imagine that Hudson's situation will not be too good, otherwise there will be no such thing as a bad boy stealing life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is that the current baroness is not of high birth, she is the daughter of a merchant. Although she is wealthy, she does not have much confidence in politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this marriage of power and money, Baron Redman undoubtedly occupies a dominant position. The fact that the Hudson brothers were able to grow up safely is the best proof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the perfect inheritance law, the title of title is definitely not up for grabs. No matter how powerful the baroness's bedside wind is, Baron Redman will not be able to replace the older ones with the younger ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hope for titles, but resources are up for grabs. In this world where the weak are prey to the strong, money does not mean everything. Precious cultivation resources and political resources cannot be bought with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the aristocratic system of Gonghou Bozinan, the baron himself is in the lower reaches, so how many resources can he have?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman is particularly capable of giving birth. With so many sons, how can he have enough resources?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially as the brothers grow older, this kind of conflict has become increasingly intense. This life liquid turmoil is the result of intensified contradictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two elder brothers in front successfully awakened the seeds of life, became knights, and entered the kingdom's army to serve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was Hudson's turn, the situation changed. The life essence, a strategic resource that assists in awakening the seeds of life, is naturally monopolized by the empire and the church.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even nobles have a limited quota, and they can't be exchanged if they want to. In order to get the life essence in advance, Baron Redman got a lot of favors, but he was forced to delay for a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this delay, the younger brother Lesuer, who is not much different in age, has also reached the age of awakening the seed of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to jump in line, even if Lesser is the most beloved son of Baron Redman, no matter how fierce the baroness's pillow is, it is still a family rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I missed this opportunity, I don't know how long I have to wait. I don't know which nerve is wrong, and the unwilling Lesur actually secretly changed the life essence in a whimsical way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the results, it is obvious that Lesser's plan ended in tragedy. The life essence was saved, but Hudson was sure that it was destined not to be used by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After staying in the hospital bed for two days, Hudson was almost moldy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without mobile phones, computers, and any entertainment activities, living in bed is simply hell-like torture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for worrying about being a devil and being sent to the grill as a devil, he wouldn't bother to pretend to be sick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past two days, important people in the castle have all visited the sick. With his super memory, Hudson can guarantee that he will not admit the wrong person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is enough. In this world of aristocrats with strict hierarchy, as long as the relationship with the upper class is properly handled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large glass of animal milk, a piece of bread, a fruit similar to a tomato, some sauces, butter, and a piece of barbecue, is Hudson's breakfast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this kind of luxurious treatment is obviously not something that an ordinary son of a baron can enjoy every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the words of Pastor Quinn have played a role. If the energy is exhausted, nature must make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just stepped out of the door, and within a few steps, he bumped into the baroness who was walking towards him. It was obvious that someone had tipped off the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to delve into this kind of thing. As the hostess of the castle, it is too easy to buy a few confidantes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you're fine, it's great! The great Lord of Dawn bless you, you know, I've been so worried these days...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson believed half of what the Baroness said. In the past few days, she was indeed very worried, but she was not worried about the body of the original owner, but worried about her own son hanging on the pillar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has been in a hospital bed for the past two days, Hudson is not ignorant of what happened in the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I learned from the maid that on the day of the incident, Baron Redman, who was furious, caught Lesur and beat him up. Even the baroness who went to persuade her was whipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe he felt puzzled, or maybe he ordered people to tie Lesur to the pillar in order to give an explanation to all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't occupied the magpie's nest and replaced Hudson, it is estimated that Lesul's wave will follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Switching life essence\". At a young age, it's just a prank; at an older age, it's murdering my brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Awakened life seeds are full of dangers. In ancient times, there was no one out of ten. It wasn't until the greatest alchemist in the continent of Aslante, Kempey, invented the life essence, that the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the success rate has been increased to half, even if the awakening fails, one life can be recovered, unlike the ancient times, it is either success or death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the birth of the life essence, which greatly increased the success rate of awakening life seeds, and the knights blessed by the gods gradually became the mainstream of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, whether it is really \"blessed by the gods\" needs further research, anyway, it is recorded in history books.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the knight who awakened the seed of life did gain benefits. It not only improves the physical fitness, but also greatly increases the affinity with beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all knights have their own mounts. When fighting alone, perhaps this advantage is not too obvious. When the system appears on the battlefield, it is a crushing scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the nobles are all precocious, and Lesur is almost fifteen years old. It is impossible not to know the danger of awakening without the aid of life essence. A prank will definitely not explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mrs. Taci, people must be responsible for their actions. If you do something wrong, you must pay the price. This is the rule that a nobleman should abide by.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson mocked unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he didn't want to be tough with the baroness at this time. But there is no way, the relationship between the original owner and the baroness has always been very bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that this kind of thing has happened, if you still maintain a pleasant face, it will be difficult not to attract attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't say that. Raisul is your brother, he's just a kid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the baroness finished speaking, Hudson interrupted pretending to be angry: \"Yes, he is still a child.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this does not affect compliance with the rules of the game, unless Madam thinks that Raisul is not a nobleman! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    mockery, naked mockery. The birth has always been the baroness's biggest pain, preventing her from integrating into the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually, whoever dares to talk about this, she has to turn her face on the spot. It's just not right now, the baby son is still hanging on the pillar, so she can't get strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the baroness who was too angry to speak, Hudson secretly sighed. The implication was so obvious that even the implication was not heard. This play was a waste of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, this high-end gameplay is not suitable for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking about it is right, if the Baroness was really that powerful, this kind of thing would not happen, and most of the brothers would not be able to grow up smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is also the reason why she was able to become a baroness. She is obviously too smart to be a stepmother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson said helplessly: \"Okay, ma'am. For your sake, I can let Lesur go, but it needs compensation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden turning point made the baroness unable to keep up with the rhythm for a while. Perhaps because of her innate talent, when she heard the word \"compensation\", her expression was visibly shocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"what do you want?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words were spoken, the baroness realized that she had made a slip of the tongue. I am at a disadvantage right now, so rushing to deliver it to my door is obviously not in line with the principles of doing business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson frowned, talking directly about the price was too vulgar, and it didn't match his aristocratic demeanor at all. Just thinking about his shriveled pocket made him lose his confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"500 gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't want anything else, the main reason is that the real owner of the castle is his father. Apart from some money in the hands of the baroness, she can't be the master at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why don't you grab it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    blurted out almost instinctively, apparently this number that Hudson thought was reasonable far exceeded the Baroness's expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ma'am, please respect yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the common practice in continental wars, the ransom for a noble knight is 500 gold coins. My asking price is completely in line with the rules, please follow the rules, madam.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the rules are involved in anything, it becomes serious. Matching the value of the prisoner of war ransom, although some nonsense, but it is not entirely aimless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Baroness knew that Lysoul would not die, as long as Hudson did not let go, the matter would not be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the matter is not settled before the news spreads, and other members of the Koslow family intervene, the matter will not be so simple.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson, you should know that this is not a small sum, and it will almost catch up with the territory's income for half a year.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness fought hard. However, Hudson kept smiling and didn't say a word, and didn't participate in the bargaining at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was the original owner, they might have been fooled. The income of the territory for half a year sounds scary, but in fact there is a lot of water in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is only this little income, I am afraid that everyone in the baron's mansion will have to eat chaff. You must know that there are very few free people these days, and most of the leaders are serfs attached to the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire baronial territory has a population of more than 10,000, and even if it is only a middle school level in mathematics, Hudson also knows that his family's income is not only what it is on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concealment of income is also an unspoken rule of the aristocratic group. Although the king only collects business taxes, the church has to collect tithes!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a devout believer, naturally he cannot resist the church's tithe. Then finding ways to lower income has become the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The per capita annual income in the territory is less than one silver coin, and it is difficult to eat grass. They can also pay tithes on time. Obviously, the Koslow family is the most devout believer of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three hundred gold coins, plus a good horse and a set of armor. Hudson, you have become a knight and need your own knight equipment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness promised again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. This is obviously fooling him like a child. Becoming a knight does require equipment, but he believes that his cheap old man will prepare it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a traditional nobleman, Baron Redman is very concerned about face, and he will definitely not make jokes in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many sons and the pockets are a little dry, isn't Lesul useless?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only saved a lot of expenses, but also added a few years of buffering time. It should not be difficult to slow down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That is to say, the baroness couldn't see the situation clearly, and she was still working hard for Lesur.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family resources, don't even think about it. Even if Baron Redman is eager to love his son and is willing to continue investing, other members of the Koslow family will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"400 gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this is all the cash I can use. If there is more, your father will find out.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is in charge of the financial power of the government in name, Baron Redman is indeed the master. What he can use is only his own small treasury, and there is really not much cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"For the remaining one hundred gold coins, let's offset it with real objects! Magic cores and crystals are fine, and Madam wouldn't be reckless just because of this little money.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be generous and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That beating expression caused the anger that the baroness had finally suppressed to burst out again. Before she could get mad, Hudson said again:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Madam, hurry up and get the money. By the way, let the baron come over. I'll go to see poor Lesoul first. It's been hanging for almost three days, and I still have injuries. If the delay is too long, no one will know.\" what happens.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, he turned around and left without giving the baroness a chance to speak, as if he had her decided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a fierce stomp, the furious Baroness suddenly calmed down. Being able to marry into an aristocratic family as a merchant's daughter and secure the position of mistress may not be politically savvy, but her house fighting skills are definitely not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is a conflict, no matter what the reason is, the only one who suffers is myself. Who will let his son cheat his mother?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the outside world mistakenly thinks that she instigated the stealing of the life essence, then it will be over. Divorce is difficult in this continent of Aslante, but widowhood is very simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from noble marriages, a baroness whose mother's family is not strong can't stand the toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wandering in the ancient castle, Hudson slowly walked to the pillar that bound Lesul until the gold coins entered the account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hanging\" is obviously an exaggeration. Although the baron ordered it that way, the guards who executed it were not dead-headed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are the sons of the baron. If they accidentally receive the lunch box, they will be the ones who will be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original \"hanging on the pillar\" directly changed to \"sitting next to the pillar\", with a maid helping to drive away mosquitoes, and a plate of fruit not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the ropes on Lesul's body connected to the pillars, and the image of disheveled hair, it would be hard for people to believe that he was being punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson approaching, the two guards were instantly embarrassed. It is obviously not a wise choice to take care of one young master but offend another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not a soft persimmon, and there are two older brothers covering him. It is no secret that the young masters of the baron's mansion are divided into two camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While sitting on the right of inheritance, and at the same time having the support of the mistress of the mansion, if Baron Redman did not suppress him, there would have been a quarrel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stand in line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop making such jokes, everyone is not a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on the face of the mistress, but in the future you have to hang out with the other side. How do you choose?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Hudson, you are here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nodded, Hudson didn't have the idea of ​​looking for the guards to be unlucky. In this hierarchical world, the survival of the little people is inherently difficult, and it is understandable to have both ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on? Raisul, my poor brother, why are you **** here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you still doing in a daze, quickly untie the rope and let him down! I'm sorry...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people who don't know see this scene, they must think that it is brotherly love. In fact, the two people who are similar in age have been pinched since they were young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, Hudson. You don't need to be hypocritical here. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be punished by my father!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, get out of here immediately! I don't want to see you for a moment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul said almost roaring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but became more affectionate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Poor Raisul, he is a little delirious now, and he doesn't even recognize your dearest brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alas, forget it. Put him down first, I will take care of my father, who made me the elder brother, I can't watch my brother suffer!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The touching scene made the guard's eyes glaze over, and he forgot what to do for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before they could react, Hudson had already drawn out the knight sword and split the rope, proving with practical actions that he was serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, a majestic middle-aged man came over, who was Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the scene just now fell into his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He glared at the two guards fiercely, and kicked Lesur, who was sitting by the pillar, flying away. Without waiting for the slightest pause, he said: \"Hudson stays, and the others bring this beast down.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone didn't react, the baroness who followed her hastily added: \"What are you still doing in a daze, take Master Lesser to treat the wound!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well he concealed it, Hudson felt the baroness's heartache. Baron Redman's kick just now was not light, and it directly made people fly three or four meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that Lesur had a good background and had practiced, he would not die or be seriously injured if he was placed on an ordinary person. It can be seen that Baron Redman is really disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not terrible to make mistakes, what's terrible is that you don't know when you make mistakes. In the aristocratic world, stupidity is the greatest original sin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After everyone left, Redman looked at Hudson, and said with a little relief: \"The progress is very fast, but it's a pity that the performance just now was too much.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Fortunately, it was discovered early, otherwise it would definitely suffer a big loss in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing Hudson's silence for a long time, he mistook it for being hit, Baron Redman comforted him: “Don't be discouraged, at your age, it's not bad to be able to do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, no matter how wonderful the performance is, it can't fool the people who are interested. It's just that most of the time, everyone chooses to pretend to be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with you wanting to make a name for yourself with this incident, but it is enough to step on Lesur so hard, he is your younger brother after all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brother cannibalism is very cruel to any father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Baron Redman punished Lesser severely, it was only a matter of hatred. Deep down in his heart, he still missed his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson asked hesitantly: \"But father, didn't you say that as a qualified nobleman, you must always think about maximizing your interests?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul, not only has bad conduct, but is also hopelessly stupid. Letting such an idiot into the noble circle will only bring shame to the family, I'm just using waste! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be kind to your enemies is to be cruel to yourself. Although the hatred belongs to the original owner, since he inherited the identity of the original owner, he must inherit this hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humanitarian destruction is too cruel, and Baron Redman will not agree, so he will take advantage of the trend and cut off Lesur's way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, as soon as this incident happened, the future development of Lesur was affected, and it was difficult to go out before the storm dissipated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the opportunity to step on it again and let him act as a stepping stone to gain a wave of prestige for himself, Lesur's future will be even more \"unfamiliar\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles have their own way of playing. No one likes a notorious guy, especially a guy like Lesser who has no title, and no one will accept him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get in the circle, how can you talk about the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Lesur is a genius in cultivation, standing at the top of the mainland in one fell swoop. But this is almost impossible, the resources in the mansion are limited, and all the brothers and sisters are staring at it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After wasting years, the genius has to disappear from everyone, not to mention that he himself is not a super genius.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Probably stimulated, Baron Redman stared at Hudson, and after a while he said slowly: \"Hudson, your views are too extreme. This is not what you should have at your age. idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with utilitarianism, but you must have a heart to control utilitarianism, and you cannot lose your heart in utilitarianism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although in the world of nobility, there is never right or wrong, there are only pros and cons; but there are many smart people in this world, and many times smart people will only be mistaken by smart people. You should learn to settle and hide your clumsiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Okay, you go down! Read the books in the library first, and then consider this issue. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman walked away, leaving a dazed Hudson standing there dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, what he said just now was just for pretending. A little calculation of Lesur, that is also following the trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship was not good in the first place. If this kind of thing happened, if he didn't even fight back, how could it not be suspicious. After all, he was only a sixteen-year-old boy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Precipitation\", \"Hidden clumsiness\", so needless to say? If it weren't for worrying that the change would be too big and attract the attention of those who cared, he would be able to live forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ambition is based on strength. Being a human being in two lifetimes, there are not many other advantages, but Hudson has learned how to bend and stretch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Goldfinger hasn't received the money for a long time. He is just an ordinary person with a little more memory. In this world where the jungle preys on the jungle, how dare you be brave?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the original owner was not a scumbag, and the thing he hates the most is reading, he would have gone to collect books a long time ago. Baron Redman's order just provided him with a perfect excuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking into the \"library\" with a vague memory in his mind, Hudson was quickly disappointed. The mountains of books that I imagined did not appear, but only carefully stored sheepskin scrolls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson had the idea of ​​making a fortune by making paper, but this unrealistic idea was quickly dispelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the cumbersome papermaking process, it is simply not something he can do with a little knowledge. The key is that the **** decides the head. If you are in the aristocratic class, you have to consider issues from the standpoint of the aristocratic group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The birth of paper can reduce the cost of knowledge dissemination and facilitate the dissemination of cultural knowledge, but is this what the noble group needs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The answer is obviously: no.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sheepskin scrolls are expensive to make, and it is of course a disadvantage that it is not conducive to the dissemination of cultural knowledge. But in turn, this is also an advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of an aristocratic group, knowledge is naturally monopolized by oneself alone. The higher the cost of disseminating cultural knowledge, the more conducive it is to maintain this monopoly system and the rule of the aristocratic group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a person with vested interests, you must not do things that betray your own class. No matter how important money is, it is not as important as life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking up a volume of general history of the mainland, Hudson immediately read it carefully and tastefully. It's a pity that most of the above content is vague and vague, and many of the content are still hearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Although the Koslow family has been passed down for thousands of years, they are only minor nobles after all, and they have no ability to collect information on the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family can be passed down to the present, and Hudson thinks the biggest reason is that it can give birth. Looking at Baron Redman, you can see that the Koslow family has always been talented in sowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the fine traditions of the family, except for the eldest son who inherited the family business, the rest of the sons brought a set of knight equipment and several attendants to go out to work hard when they became adults.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cruel survival mode, the best way to train people. Although most of the clan members fell on the road of hard work, some lucky ones stood out. Either by relying on military exploits, or by relying on the marriage of nobles to get the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accumulated from generation to generation, there are not a few small nobles bearing the banner of the Koslow family. They are considered to be the most prosperous families in the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people do not necessarily mean great strength, but the ability to survive if there are many people must be strong. Even if a certain line dies, someone will make up for it soon, and there will be no tragedy of being forced to take back the fiefdom by the empire because there is no heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this mode of operation, slowly infiltrating all the way, even if there are no particularly outstanding figures born, the Koslow family will be able to become the top wave sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the prerequisite is that the fertility rate can continue to be so high. Otherwise, in this world where wars often break out, no one knows which will come first, tomorrow or the accident. Maybe a war will directly wipe out the accumulation of thousands of years.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be said that from the moment of birth, war has accompanied the life of the nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons for the outbreak of the war are all kinds of strange things, only unexpected, nothing impossible. A nest of honey or a beast may become the fuse of the outbreak of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the existence of extraordinary power, Hudson would have doubted that he had returned to the Middle Ages. Except for the addition of alien races, the continent of Aslant is simply a replica of the European Middle Ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of the cost, except for the key descriptions related to the Koslow family, most of the rest are just passing through, which made Hudson very disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most troublesome thing is that these are all past materials, which are completely inconsistent with the current situation. If you want to know the situation in the outside world, you can only ask Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as a Xibei product, Hudson has no time to hide from him now, so how could he send it to his door?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to find the answer he wanted, and returned to his residence full of doubts, Hudson suddenly found that the magic beast crystal nucleus on his body had turned into powder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Baroness fooling herself with fakes?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this thought arose, Hudson dismissed it. At the time of delivery, he also personally inspected it, and the strong magic power cannot be faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the time is so short, and it's too late to arrange the fake ones. Hudson didn't think the Baroness could have a magician at her side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrating, Hudson vaguely found that there seemed to be an extra compass in his mind, and there was a four-character inscription engraved on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold Finger seems to have got it. Unfortunately, Hudson has limited knowledge and doesn't know the four ancient Chinese characters above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, even knowing it is useless. No matter how simple the operation procedure is, it is impossible to have only four words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't know how to use it, and Hudson is not annoyed. Regardless of whether it can be used or not, it is better than nothing. The compass is activated after absorbing magic power, which is an entry point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe if you feed a few more magic cores, you will be able to find out how to use the compass. Just thinking of the high price of the magic core made Hudson feel bad in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, he just didn't have the fate to make a fortune. In the previous life, he was in debt and moved forward, but he did not expect that after time travel, he would still be a poor ghost. I just made a small fortune, and I'm about to spit it out again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic core is not easy to change, you have to go to a big city, and the remote town of Tielun probably has a collection in the Baron's Mansion and Pastor Quinn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is a magician and alchemist, he still hopes to find a cheap father for prostitution. Forget about the knight, the profession is not right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no rush for this kind of thing, and the cautious Hudson will not take risks before he has figured out the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, just as a round of red clouds rose in the sky, the square of the town was full of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knight does not exist alone, and must have auxiliary attendants. After all, armor, weapons, and horses also need someone to take care of them, and noble knights and lords can't be ashamed to do it themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was no exception. Today it was his turn to choose his attendants, and all the teenagers in the square came here to try their luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is just a knight servant, it is still unattainable for ordinary citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking this step, you are eligible to participate in military training. If you make meritorious service on the battlefield, you can also get rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is indeed dangerous, but the problem is that if you don't become a knight attendant, you still have to follow the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For small and medium nobles who could not afford to support a standing army, it was commonplace to conscript serfs to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the survival rate of following the leader is always higher than that of the soldiers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, start selecting people in your own way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Close cooperation is required on the battlefield, and of course the closer the attendants are, the better. Hudson is naturally familiar with this group of spirited guys in front of him, and there are many close people among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But they belonged to the original owner and have nothing to do with the current Hudson. With only the vague memory in his mind, he couldn't tell who was who.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoever intends to become a knight servant, run ten laps along the town, with the hourglass falling as the time limit.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the smile fell into the eyes of all the teenagers, but it looked extraordinarily terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that there was only half of the hourglass left, everyone hurried to run, lest they be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you can't beat the enemy, as long as you can outrun your teammates. In Hudson's view, the war in the aristocratic world is also \"the one who remains is king\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era of serious class solidification, it is almost impossible to soar to the sky. For a small nobleman like him who has no inheritance rights, the best way is to boil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is far easier to survive until the previous heir receives the box lunch, or until the relatives die out, or find a marriage with a noble with a small number of people, than to obtain a fief after making military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the land now is owned by the owner. Unless there is an external force to break through, it is difficult to have a big opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, one radish and one hole, without the emergence of unclaimed fiefs, there will be no new fief nobles born. Even if credit is made, it is only an honorary nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shushashasha...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hourglass bottomed out soon, and the teenagers who participated in the knight attendants returned to the square one after another, either rejoicing or dejected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when Hudson was about to announce the result, Baron Redman suddenly said: \"A total of 31 people arrived on time, let's start the second round!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson understood what was going on, too many people passed. Tielun Town naturally does not lack this population, but the problem is that he lacks a source of income now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, after several months of running-in training, he will go out to fend for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, the more knight attendants who don't need wages, the better, but Baron Redman doesn't think he can afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traditional knights make their living from wars, and life would be difficult without a foundation. But Hudson is different. He doesn't have the burden of noble honor, and he can go to bandits to rob caravans when he is in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sharp sword in your hand and valleys in your chest, how can you be hungry?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arms can't hold the thighs, and now they have to rely on Baron Redman to live. Hudson said helplessly: \"Next, the ten strongest people will be selected in terms of skills.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, he ignored Baron Redman's ugly expression. Ten people is already his final bottom line, there can be no less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More people do not necessarily mean greater strength, but fewer people will definitely suffer. To start a business in the era of cold weapons, the more teams the better.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Everyone cheer me up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sweat more in normal times, and bleed less in wartime. Why are you idiots so ignorant...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the scorching sun, Hudson looked at the group of sweating teenagers and reprimanded them endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the completion of the selection of knight attendants, this scene has become the norm, and everyone has long seen it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knights are born for war, and it is only a matter of time before they go to the battlefield, so naturally they have to keep up as servants. Not only to kill the enemy, but also to act as a human shield at critical moments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of his own life, Hudson put in all his strength and used all the training knowledge in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After three months of tossing, the ten people in front of them can be regarded as well-trained. Even the majestic Baron Redman expressed his affirmation of Hudson's achievements, bluntly saying that he has the potential to be a general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that potential is always just potential. Hudson, who has been beaten by society, doesn't think he is so good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what the outside world thinks, the opponent's training has never been relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pay attention to your surroundings, you will find that Baron Redman is watching with his three young sons not far away, or stealing from him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, in this closed world, knowledge is so rare. Especially military-related knowledge, I can't find a place to learn it, so I can only slowly explore and summarize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scattered notes of the elders are the most precious inheritance of the nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great aristocrats can always occupy the upper hand, a large part of the reason is the monopoly of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training method that Hudson thought was insignificant was invaluable to Baron Redman. If you are too embarrassed to ask your son for it, you can simply learn and record from the sidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a pain for the three little guys. They are naughty at their age, and with the doting of the baroness, they don't even know how precious the knowledge in front of them is. Baron Redman's hard work is destined to be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially Lesur, who is staring at Hudson with resentment at the moment. If Baron Redman's attention was not on him, a meal of fried pork with bamboo shoots would have been unavoidable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a long time, Lesur finally couldn't help but said: \"Father, my basic knight training has been completed, look at the life essence...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish speaking, Baron Redman's expression darkened suddenly, he gave him a hard look, and said nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more so, the more disturbed Lesur was. For this life essence, he paid a heavy price. If he couldn't get the life essence, it would be a real blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, I can only hope that my two younger brothers will help me to intercede. It's a pity that the children of the nobles are all precocious, even if they are brothers, they can't stand that everyone is now a competitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family resources are limited. If you get more, I get less. There is no way. Lesur committed a big taboo, if he can be kicked out, it will be good for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't add insult to injury, it's all for the sake of brotherhood. After exchanging glances with Lesur, the two little brats looked away tacitly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene happened to fall into the eyes of Baron Redman. It's just that all this in front of him is not enough to move him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic world is cruel. If you don't fight or grab, you won't be able to gain a foothold in this world of the jungle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chivalry qualities: humility, honesty, compassion, valor, justice, sacrifice, honor, soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The survival rule of the nobility is: interests first, hypocrisy, utilitarianism, selfishness, rationality... are all necessary skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after satisfying survival, will the noble spirit be born: integrity, morality, sense of mission...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What you can't get is always the best, and what everyone admires the most is often what everyone lacks the most in real life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be distracted, watch Hudson's training carefully, it will be good for your future development.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is his own son, and he cannot be completely ruthless. In his view, Lysur is now completely putting the cart before the horse. Rather than thinking about the life essence that does not belong to him, it is better to take the opportunity to learn more knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, after discovering Hudson's military training talent at first, Baron Redman also wanted him to train an elite army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, my own pockets are not rich, so I can't afford a standing army at all. In the entire barony, the only armed force is the castle's guard of less than fifty people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the number of people is small, it is natural to pay more attention to individual combat effectiveness. What's more, the guards and the army themselves are not the same type, and applying it mechanically will only be self-defeating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the art of military training is a piece of cake for the little nobles. Only by defecting to the king or the great nobles can they be useful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not knowing what his father was planning, Hudson still worked hard to train his men. In this world of extraordinary power, it is difficult for ordinary people to compete with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even a junior knight like Hudson can easily defeat more than a dozen strong men. This is the basis for the aristocratic group to be able to rule the world all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by the monopoly of resources, coupled with the tacit understanding of the noble group, the life essence never leaks out, and it is almost impossible for common people to become knights. An extraordinary route suitable for ordinary people, only warriors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also extraordinary, a knight of the same realm completely beats a warrior. Not only because of the support of the mount, but the most important thing is the awakening of the seed of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson doesn't know what the life seed is, he has experienced the benefits of awakening the life seed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most intuitive feeling is that the overall quality of the body has improved. After each high-intensity training, the seeds of life will release a burst of energy to repair physical damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, soldiers are much more miserable. Without the support of life seeds, there are many hidden injuries left in daily training, let alone on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long-lived knights are not uncommon, but there are very few long-lived warriors, and they usually don't live to be fifty years old. A short lifespan naturally limits the improvement of strength. Looking at the entire continent, there are only a handful of strong fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the mysterious magician, that is Hudson's knowledge blind spot, and only a few strokes in the family book collection can't explain the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention other niche occupations, ordinary people will never encounter them once in a lifetime, and Hudson has no way to learn about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is just to train knight servants, a simple training is enough, and there is no need to work so hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I still have a restless heart. Even if my heart keeps saying that I need to \"give it up\", my body is still very honest and trying to cultivate the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first pot of gold in life is always the most difficult to obtain. Right now there are only ten people available, although the number is not many, it is better than none.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The governor of the southeastern province, Count Pierce, was furious and ordered the nobles in the province to be recruited to counter the rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of news being blocked broke out at this moment. Obviously, the Skull and Bones rebellion happened for more than a month, but the Koslow family knew nothing about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the call-up orders in hand, Baron Redman didn't know the situation on the front line, so he could only passively accept the orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, you can know the severity of the situation without intelligence. If it is an ordinary rebellion, the surrounding lords will be strangled together, and there is no need for the entire province to be recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One baronie recruited 500 people. The last mobilization of this intensity was the orc invasion a hundred years ago, but that was based on the premise of preparation in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that such an order is issued, in Hudson's opinion, Earl Pierce is most likely to be overwhelmed by the collapse of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army doesn't mean that the larger the number, the stronger it is. An army composed of 500 untrained serfs is not as effective as the castle guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the time left for everyone to prepare is only three days, which is the biggest failure. Regardless of other things, weapons, armor, food and grass must be prepared, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of purely voluntary recruitment, the boss is not responsible for the food, the food, grass, and supplies are all raised by everyone, so it is strange that the subordinates have no grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is urgent, Hudson, what do you think of this call?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman asked with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two older sons are away, and now they are in trouble, so they have to pull Hudson, who seems to have a bit of military talent, to make up the numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other people in the territory, it is a pity that Baron Redman is a traditional nobleman and has no habit of discussing with commoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, the situation is still unclear, and it is not appropriate to join the main force of the family in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The call-up order only requires 500 troops, so 500 young men will be selected for a little training, and the call-up will be completed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite the fact that there is only a guard team of dozens of people in his family, Baron Redman has accumulated decades of wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the serf army is worthless. Even if it loses a few hundred people, it will not be able to shake the foundation of its own rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For nobles, war is not all bad, at least it can consume excess population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, Dadir City is one of the largest cities in the southeastern province. The strength of the local nobles is not weak, but they were taken over by the rebels. Naturally, things will not be simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I received the information too late. If I had prepared earlier and trained an elite team, maybe your noble title would have been secured. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said regretfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities presented themselves, but they could not be grasped because they were not fully prepared. This is obviously a tragedy in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a moment of emotion. If Baron Redman really puts it all together, he may not be able to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the Koslow family already wears shoes. Even if the shoes are not so comfortable, it is difficult to make up their minds to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, don't be sad. There is never a lack of opportunities in this world. Even if there are no opportunities, opportunities can be created. The key lies in strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There should be quite a few people staring at this rebellion. The rebel army can grow rapidly, and I am afraid there must be someone behind it to fuel the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With our strength, even if we make great achievements on the battlefield, at most we will be assigned one or two knight leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This Earl Pierce is not very good at eating, and it is not easy to follow him to get ahead. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has never killed a pig himself, and he has seen pigs run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebellion broke out for more than a month. Not only did no army be organized to suppress the rebellion, but even the news did not spread. If there was no deliberate indulgence by Earl Pierce behind it, it would have been impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is innocent, but pregnant is guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance left by the extinct nobles has obviously been targeted long ago. Only limited by the rules of the game, there is no way to \"big fish eat small fish\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skull and Bones rebellion just happened at the right time, and it just gave these guys a chance. In this context, how dare Hudson take food from the tiger's mouth?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't like Earl Pierce?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After several months of getting along, he has long discovered that Hudson is not a thing in the pool. As for the mediocrity in the past, in his opinion, it was deliberately hiding his clumsiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Hudson is only the third son in the family. If he behaves too outstandingly, not only the stepmother will find it difficult, but even the eldest son will dislike him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that I have to go out and set up my own family, these problems are no longer a problem, and it is also necessary to show my talents and win family resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know what Cheapy's father thinks. Anyway, Hudson's power to speak in the mansion has increased a lot recently, which is reflected in the late-night discussion with Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The hearts of the people are scattered, and the team is not easy to lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's plan seems to be very perfect, and the skill of killing people with borrowed knives is so perfect that people can't grasp it. But the world of nobility, why does it need evidence?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most simple logic: Whoever is the biggest beneficiary is behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can grab the fattest meat this time, it is rare to be the earls of the kingdom's twelve fiefdoms, how much strength can they increase?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this benefit, it is not worth the loss to arouse the hostility of the nobles under his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that among the nobles who were exterminated, many of them were their vassals. I dare not serve such a master. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is a professional. I think when I was a keyboard man, I sprayed everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what it is, as long as you want to complain, you can find a bunch of reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now playing with these, there is only one purpose - to fool Baron Redman into paddling in the next war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is somewhat immoral, it is better than safety!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I am not a vassal of Earl Pierce, so I have no obligation to work for him. Even if they accept the call, they still have a high degree of autonomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Got it, I'll think about it again.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what kind of person Earl Pierce is, and no matter what his future will be, he is still the boss of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It still takes courage to be obedient and obedient under the eyes of the boss. Unless there is collective resistance from the small and medium nobles, the rafters that stand alone will most likely rot first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, why don't I lead the army this time? You are in charge of the territory, and there is room for maneuver if something happens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the recruitment is too urgent this time, and it is estimated that everyone will not have time to prepare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the serfs are trained a little bit, and they form an army that can be seen, they can handle it by mixing in the big team. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be confident and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

War is imminent. He can't escape at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running at this juncture, there is a high probability that someone will be stopped halfway, and then forcibly recruited into the army as cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although we haven't been together for a long time, he still has some understanding of Baron Redman. His political ability can barely be considered a passing grade, and his military accomplishment is a complete mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the analysis of his previous battles, Hudson came to a conclusion: a \"knight\" with good luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to survive until now, apart from being not weak, the most important thing is that the enemies you encounter are all players of the same level. Everyone made an appointment, set up a posture, and charged with the younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategy and tactics do not exist. It is estimated that there are no such concepts in his dictionary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to despise, everyone plays like this these days. It's all about real hard work, and there is very little hypocrisy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is very unfriendly to Hudson. If he goes to the battlefield with his own father, it is estimated that he will have to rush up and fight with real swords and guns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a rookie Cavalier, Hudson is not yet ready to fight with others. In his view, the so-called noble glory is all vain, and only his life is his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is really necessary to fight, let the younger brothers go first. Everyone is a mob, as long as they are slightly stronger than the rebels, that's enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The important task of countering the rebellion should be handed over to teammates. If you fight with the wind, just keep up. If you lose a battle, you just need to run faster than your teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To gain a sense of presence among the aristocratic group, familiarity is enough. If you can make some military achievements by the way, it's blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crisis and opportunity coexist. If you want to step up to the sky and stand out, the risks involved are too great. Hudson, who is self-aware, feels that he is still unable to grasp this weak chicken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Hudson still thinks things too simply. If Baron Redman was so easy to be fooled, he would have been played to death long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not that there are no idiots among the noble children, but unless these idiots are born in a particularly good family and are covered by a backstage, most of them will not survive three episodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks simple and straightforward on the battlefield, that is because of the overall atmosphere of society. The general environment is like this, how can individuals not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final result was that Baron Redman greatly appreciated his performance. As for his offer to lead the army, he neither refused nor agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back in the room, Hudson was already desperate. Words can be deceiving, but bodies are often honest. Baron Redman spoke nicely, but the expression on his brows was obviously full of distrust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's right to think about it, a kid who is more than sixteen years old suddenly proposes to lead troops to fight alone, no parent can rest assured!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, they still brought five hundred young men to the battlefield. The Koslow family is not rich, and they really can't afford such expensive tuition fees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the enemy this time is the rebel army who killed the nobles like a dog. The rules of the game between the nobles are completely unknown, let alone expected to be followed by the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, Baron Redman, who was lying on the bed, could not fall asleep for a long time. Obviously, the conversation just now had a great impact on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having spent half his life in the aristocratic circle, he is very aware of how much darkness is hidden behind this glamorous group. For profit, there is nothing they cannot do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if Hudson's deduction is correct, how should he deal with himself now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the Koslow family is still too weak. The population is prosperous and scattered all over the place, it can only deter the small and medium nobles of the same level, and it is not enough to meet the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you really want to paddle?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This seems contrary to chivalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that he has never done this in previous wars. With a radius of hundreds of miles, who doesn't know the bravery of Baron Redman?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't want to damage my reputation, and I don't want to be cannon fodder. Baron Redman, who was in a dilemma, lost sleep that night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    . . .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next day, the news of the recruitment had spread in the castle. Whether it was servants or guards in the castle, they all joined the discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This does not include Lysul. Since he failed to ask for the life essence, he has been in a bad mood, which made the baroness also worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leisul, look away. Your father is also in a difficult situation. The impact of this incident is too great. You must make a gesture, otherwise...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the baroness could finish speaking, Lesser interrupted angrily: \"That's enough, isn't it just to give those **** an explanation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the previous punishment was not enough, and I must be killed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all members of the Koslow family, why should I bow my head?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because you were born late?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the right of inheritance is forced to go to the back, but even the resources have to go to the back. This is really unfair!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness had heard the almost growling complaint countless times. But the rules are like this, and she can't change them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though she knew that Baron Redman treated her sons equally, and that her own children received more care because of the bedside wind, she was still not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how hard you try, you can't change the order of inheritance. This meant that the family business of the baron's mansion had nothing to do with her son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, she had accepted the reality, but seeing the tragedy of Lesur once again aroused her inner unwillingness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was because of anger, or maybe because she hated iron and steel, the baroness stepped forward and gave Lesser a big mouth, and angrily said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up, Raisul!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many times have I told you, you can't talk nonsense. If you let your father know what you said just now, you will be kicked out now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are not even a knight now. If you are expelled from the family, you will no longer be a noble nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you want to be with the untouchables outside, and spend your whole life at the bottom, without any hope...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not reconciled to return, but the baroness knows the hard-won status of nobility. No matter how much she dotes on her son, she still knows that there are some things that cannot be said nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is..., how much better can my current situation be?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He would rather give the life essence to outsiders than give me this son. Can you still expect to get another copy for me next time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he had the heart, he might not have the ability. Hudson, that bitch, was forced to delay for a year, let alone us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to know that according to the usual practice, after fulfilling the obligations of the empire, the baron's mansion can only exchange for a life essence every ten years. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just finished speaking, seeing the baroness's face change drastically, Lesser suddenly realized that he had done another stupid thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is not the only seedling of his mother, besides himself, there are two younger brothers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson is about to go out to make a living by himself, the next fight for resources will be the turn of the three brothers. The palms and backs of his hands are full of flesh, can the baroness support him unconditionally?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As long as you are willing to pay the price, you can definitely get the life essence, but the time is not certain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are also mixed circles, even if there is life liquid flowing out, most of them circulate in their respective circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this kind of strategic resources, what everyone trades is not only benefits, but also human feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul, who was already sensitive, became even more ugly when he saw what his mother said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will come back in a few years\", but how many years can people live?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the age, when the life essence returns in a few years, the two younger brothers below will also be about the same age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for himself, there is a high probability that he was given up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Lesser's hatred for Hudson surged up again. In his view, it was all Hudson's fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson's previous stimulation, he wouldn't steal the life essence, and naturally he wouldn't become notorious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Revenge, must be revenge!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laisul, who was dazzled by hatred, had only one thought in his mind - to kill Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of thing is okay when you think about it, but it's not that simple to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's definitely not enough to do it directly.

Once this kind of thing starts, there will be endless troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much dissatisfaction there is in her heart, the baroness is unwilling to take risks. After all, Hudson, an eyesore, was about to go out to fend for himself, and he might die outside at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wait, Mother!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there going to be a war outside?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Called to stop the baroness who was about to leave, Lesser asked a little excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness nodded slightly hesitantly.

If something happens to Baron Redman on the battlefield, the happy life of mother and child will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is unlikely that he will be kicked out directly, it is inevitable that his status will plummet. Even for the face of the nobility, the stepson who inherited the family business still respected her, but the future of the sons was hanging in the balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brother and father are completely two concepts.

As long as you buy a few people and wait for the opportunity to attack him, you will be able to succeed in one fell swoop. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the only reliable solution he can think of to design Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little thought, the baroness shook her head regretfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention, the soldiers who can go out together are all loyal to the Koslow family for generations, and they are not so easy to be bought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone is really willing to do it, acting under your father's nose, it is inevitable that there will be no clues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Hudson is a Cavalier now. Waiting for three or five strong men to be opponents at all, it is not easy to plot against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the snake does not die and leaves clues, it will be a big trouble. Once your father suspects us, the matter will not end. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rejected again, Raisul's heart was bleeding. The strategy he finally came up with was rejected by his mother, which made him very hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his opinion, his mother has \"long hair, but short knowledge.\" If he is more decisive, Hudson and the others will not be able to grow up at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The epic heroes that Yunyou Poets sang about grew up slowly after being persecuted. Although I am playing the villain now, the annoying Hudson is obviously not the protagonist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lesul is very sure of this, no protagonist can be so mediocre. He has neither a fiancée who came to divorce, nor a childhood experience of eating bran and swallowing vegetables, and he doesn't even have an extraordinary talent for cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone grew up, but he never noticed that Hudson had any shining points. If my mother hadn't looked forward and backward, she would have killed this annoying ghost long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the three evils above were killed, the Koslow family would belong to him, Lesur, and there would be no embarrassment at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While Laisul was flirting with herself, the baroness at the side said thoughtfully: \"It's inconvenient for us to take action directly, but that **** Hudson volunteered to lead troops to the battlefield alone last night in order to win favor, but was rejected Your father refused.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let him go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mother, let him go at all costs!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The battlefield is changing rapidly, and accidents may happen to anyone. If Hudson died on the battlefield, even if my father had doubts, nothing could be found out.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more I think about it, the more I think it is feasible. First design to kill Hudson, and then follow the same pattern to assassinate the other two brothers. He will be the first heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"However, Lesul. The battlefield is changing rapidly. If the plan fails and Hudson makes military exploits, then the loss outweighs the gain.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The baroness said slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Baron Redman did not disclose the details of the conversation to her, and he did not know the \"water paddling plan\" proposed by Hudson, otherwise he would not be so entangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mother, you think too highly of Hudson. Don't listen to the father's bragging. Before each son leaves, he will encourage him, which is not true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What abilities Hudson has, can you still not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is really capable, he has never had any experience in leading troops. If he can hold his ground on the battlefield, it will be fine if he doesn't collapse before the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to make military exploits is simply a dream. The other aristocrats are not fools, and they must rush to grab the benefits. Without his father, Hudson must not be able to grab others. At that time, the benefits will not be reaped, and they may become cannon fodder. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul's analysis was methodical, as if there was a mysterious power added to him at this moment, which made his thinking extraordinarily clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tomorrow, I will test the waters, Piao Piao will go, rushing to the first place in the new book category\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Beside them were ten teenagers holding whips and acting as instructors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you run too fast, you will be whipped, if you run too slowly, you will be whipped, if the queue is not neat, you will be whipped, and everyone will lose their temper completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the enslavement education in the territory is still very successful, and the imaginary thorns have not appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After secretly despising the backward enslavement education, Hudson enjoyed the results with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a short time, it is obviously too late to carry out military training. What he can do now is to teach them to obey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are preparing to paddle, you still need to do what you should. The actual combat effectiveness is not important, the key is to look combat effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at Earl Pierce being worthless in front of his own father, when it really needs to be faced, Hudson still dare not take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it would be effortless for a big man like him to kill a small bean like him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, we're leaving the day after tomorrow. Is there time for training now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he felt that his son had the talent for military training, the time was still too short. In order to ensure that they will be on the road on time, they dare not even practice too hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of training intensity, it is not even comparable to military training in military academies. It's not that Hudson is soft-hearted, it's mainly because the soldiers' physical fitness can't keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era of backward productivity, it is the conscience of the lord to eat black bread with added ingredients.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is so difficult to fill the stomach, let alone those who are not nutritious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nutrition can't keep up, and they have to undertake heavy labor. Over the years, the body will naturally not get better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why everyone flocks to the Baron's Mansion every time it recruits people. No matter what job it is, as long as you hang out with the master, you can at least fill your stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, right now, with so much tossing around, no one wants to back down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is dangerous to go to the battlefield, but high risks have high rewards. It has nothing to do with them to reach the sky in one step, but as long as they make military exploits, there is still a chance to join the **** team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the guards in the baron's mansion were produced in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking this step not only solved the stomach problem, but also obtained the qualification to practice fighting qi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you become a soldier, the treatment is different. Not only is food, clothing, housing and transportation all covered, but you can also receive a salary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, father. We don't expect to train an elite soldier in a short period of time, as long as they look capable of fighting on the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The recruitment is so strong, even if the area ravaged by the rebels is deducted, the southeastern province can mobilize tens of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many troops belonging to different families, it is not that simple to command them freely. At that time, most of them will be mixed up. Once they fight, who can tell the difference! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was an undisguised contempt for Earl Pierce's mobilization order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking my family as an example, the castle guards can defeat the five hundred soldiers in front of them with a single charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling up a large number of troops at one time, in addition to sounding imposing, is actually asking for trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a fight really starts, you will find that whether it is logistics, command, or combat effectiveness, it is terrible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of this, it is better to mobilize a small number of noble elites. Not only is the command convenient and the logistics guaranteed, but the combat effectiveness is also stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think it's just his own obedience. I am afraid that the nobles who sense something is wrong will choose to hide their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If this is the case, then it would be the best. It's just that you have no combat experience after all, so you should be cautious when you are on the battlefield, and don't try to be arrogant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a letter I wrote to a few old friends. If you encounter you on the battlefield, you will give it to them. For my sake, they should take care of you a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this cannot be relied on. If there is a danger, or if there is a big interest involved, none of these people can be relied on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation is unfavorable, you should put your life first without damaging your family's reputation. Remember: there is hope only when people are alive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just fell into Hudson's ears, but it was extremely uncomfortable. I don't know if it's an illusion, but Hudson always feels that his father is implying him: he can be a deserter at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that being a deserter is completely inconsistent with chivalry. Nobles can be captured, but once they become deserters on the battlefield, they can no longer mix in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of family reputation, many nobles would rather die in battle or be captured than deserters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is not impossible to operate. As long as an unknown little character like Hudson is a little smart, even if he becomes a deserter, no one will notice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to go far away. With the speed of news transmission these days, the probability of being discovered is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, did you agree to let me lead the army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was prepared to be rejected. After all, it is unreliable for a sixteen-year-old boy to lead troops to the expedition. No matter how good the reason is, it cannot change the flaws of age and experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't expect that there would be a turning point. Whatever the reason, Hudson was pleasantly surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life-saving is paramount on the battlefield, so there is no need to be reminded. As a traverser, Hudson would not dare to wave when the golden finger is not strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of chivalry, noble glory, family reputation, the burden of these traditional nobles, all of which do not exist here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, Hudson made a plan, which can be summed up as - \"Don't seek merit, but seek no fault.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be too happy, this counter-insurgency is not that simple. If you want to take advantage of the opportunity to gain military exploits, you can support it as a father, but if you lose your life, you can't blame others.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said sternly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he really has high hopes for Hudson. Everything is determined by the social environment. In the continent of Aslante, if the little nobles want to go further, there are only two ways: either you are particularly capable of fighting; or you command the army to be particularly capable of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the former way, the latter has a higher upper limit obviously. After all, it is a low-magic world. No matter how powerful an individual is, he cannot fight against a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As strong as Sanctuary, you must run faster in front of thousands of troops. The myths of an enemy country only exist in myths after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the unattainable to become a strong man, the latter path has countless successful examples. Although the big nobles occupy high positions in the court, there are also shadows of small and medium nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After several generations of management, it is nothing new for a small noble to counterattack and become a big noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it cannot be regarded as a counterattack. The aristocratic group has been married for generations, and the internal relationship is intricate. If it is really about blood, there is a high probability that they can still be connected together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson's good mood disappeared without a trace in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally planned to \"paddle\", but seeing the pile of broken copper and iron in front of him, even if he didn't paddle, he would not be able to make waves on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Baron Redman was also a little embarrassed. Although he knew that his arsenal didn't have any good things, it was still a bit unexpected that it was so bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The family is not rich and cannot afford too many weapons and armor. There are seventy-two sets of armor in the arsenal, thirty-six battle axes, forty-eight fighting axes, ninety-seven scimitars, and one hundred and eighty-seven spears...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the accumulation of the family, although they are a bit old, they can still kill people. Let's make do with it first, if there are gains on the battlefield, it's not too late to change the outfit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said slightly embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to keep some weapons and armor, so as not to lose all of them. Now it seems that it is completely overwhelmed. Although the pile of broken copper and rotten iron in front of me is well sealed, it is still hard to hide the traces of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the armors, many of them were unthreaded and scattered all over the ground. Even if it can be stitched together again, the thick rust can't be concealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson picked up a piece casually, squeezed it a little harder, and it did not disappoint him, the nail piece turned into powder directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Baron Redman resolutely chose to escape. It was so embarrassing that he had no face left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this can't be completely blamed on him. There have been no major wars in recent decades, and small-scale conflicts with convoys are enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the equipment of the guards, you can tell that they are all high-quality weapons and armor, which is enough to prove that he is a martial patriarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the arsenal, there is no way. Weapons also have a service life. If they are not used for a long time, the best way is to seal them up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sealing up weapons and armor is not easy, you need to ask a magician to take action, and it will not be unsealed until it is ready for use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well it can be sealed, it will not be able to withstand the erosion of time. According to the data on paper, it is barely enough to equip 500 soldiers, but in reality, less than one-third of them can be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is only usable. If you are picky about the quality, I am afraid that it is beautifying to describe it as one. Anyway, looking around, few pieces are intact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have come to this, Hudson has nothing to say. Hurry up and send the damaged weapons to the blacksmith for repairs, and you can count as much as you can salvage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is also a beautiful vision. In such a short period of time, even if the few blacksmiths in the territory worked around the clock, they couldn't repair a few pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talking is better than nothing, Hudson can only retreat to the next best thing, and equip soldiers with the most primitive weapon-spear. It is not a normal weapon spear, but a spear made of bamboo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to obtain a stronger defense, Hudson also mobilized the people to make \"shields\". There is no doubt that this is not a conventional shield, but a Xibei product made of bamboo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to rely on this thing to block the weapon, you probably have no hope. But the opponent is the rebels! How can the rebel army be fully equipped with weapons and armor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is useless on the battlefield, these preparatory work are not in vain. With a little modification and a movable bamboo board, put on a rope, it is a backpack in the shape of a turtle shell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can usually carry dry food, and it can also increase the confidence of soldiers on the battlefield. In case of encountering an enemy with a wooden stick, it can also play a defensive role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the time is too short, and only some simple tools can be made. Otherwise Hudson would not be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, just because the equipment of the low-level soldiers can't be seen by others doesn't mean that this knight is also so sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight swords, war horses, armor, all the equipment a knight should have, and even the ten knight attendants were assigned corresponding armor weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Baron Redman is not stingy. As for the miserable equipment of ordinary soldiers, Hudson is more willing to believe that there is nothing he can do about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main war came too suddenly. If the intelligence had been received from the beginning, with the production capacity of the territory, no matter what, one hundred and eighty weapons could be produced in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time flies, and the three-day deadline has passed by. Riding a tall horse, wearing bright armor, and carrying a knight's sword, Hudson set off with five hundred \"well-trained\" soldiers under the farewell of the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The momentum of \"majestic and high-spirited\" did not last long after all. Not long after leaving their own territory, the originally neat team became disorganized, and Hudson was so angry that he was furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emotional two-day training camp is a loneliness. The so-called well-trained is just for the elders in the hometown to see, and it will be revealed as soon as it comes out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson could only choose to slow down the marching speed. Originally planned to travel sixty miles a day, it was forced to cut it down to forty miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that this is a small group of troops marching, they only carry a dozen catties of dry food with them, and there is no heavy logistical material to drag them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This speed is simply tortoise speed. Forget it, don't insult the turtle. The tortoise that has become a monster is much faster than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the speed slowed down, the situation improved a lot in an instant. Although it is hopeless to be neat and tidy, at least the basic queue is kept, so that they will not run around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't even need to think about Hudson, he knows that this is because the officer he temporarily appointed is unqualified, and he didn't lead the soldiers below him well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way. These days, officers with a little bit of ability are basically nobles, so how could he be able to command them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for recruiting wandering knights to serve as officers, let's go to sleep, dreams will have everything. The baron's resources are not enough for his own brothers, so how can he afford knights?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, to evaluate the strength of a nobleman, one can tell by the number of knights under his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically speaking, if you can support a dozen or so knights, you can be considered a middle-class nobleman. And if you want to step into the threshold of great nobles, you must have at least a few hundred knights under your command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just Hudson's personal subjective judgment and is not representative. If you want to become a great nobleman, these things alone are definitely not enough, otherwise the great nobleman is too cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Koslow family as an example, relying on their strong fertility, they spread all over the place. It is estimated that there are hundreds of knights scattered all over the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, because the territory is too scattered and the power cannot be concentrated, the Koslow family can only be regarded as a small noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is nothing more than relying on the prosperity of the population, speaking in the aristocratic circle a little bit harder than the average small aristocrat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This point can be seen from the dusty arsenal at home. In recent decades, the surrounding neighbors have been very peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The places along the way are disgusted by ghosts and gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, Hudson has repeatedly emphasized military discipline. Without his order, no one would dare to leave the large army, let alone harm the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it doesn't make any sense. The people along the way ran away when they saw the army, and they had no chance to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, I meet a few noble lords to communicate with, and they are just sending the plague god. If it weren't for Earl Pierce's call-up order, these guys might have sent troops to expel them directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After driving for three days in a row, Hudson noticed something was wrong. It seemed that he was running too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The call-up order was not aimed at my family. The nobles in the entire southeastern province were within the scope of the call-up. Judging from the reactions of the nobles along the way, it was clear that they were preparing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being the first to arrive on the battlefield can certainly increase impression points, but it is also possible to be the first to be sent as cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family knows their own affairs, and Hudson has no hope for his \"well-trained\" army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of this, Hudson slowed down his march again. Every morning on the road, in the afternoon to set up camp, and by the way, some game to improve the food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plump porcupines, strong elks, jubilant hares, vigorous pheasants...all became regular guests on Hudson's dining table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even ordinary soldiers can get a bowl of broth from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The selfless gift of nature made Hudson understand why there are so many wandering knights in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Land, forests, rivers, grasslands... are all private territories of nobles. Without the permission of nobles, commoners cannot fish and hunt privately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only the nobles who hunt once in a while, obviously unable to keep up with the reproduction speed of wild beasts, which is why the prey is everywhere now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules are bound by ordinary people, and they are completely inapplicable to nobles. Even the worst wandering knight can hunt freely. Even if it is discovered by the owner, at most it will be expelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just sending away a porcupine, Hudson, who was in high spirits, was interrupted by a familiar voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, Cheers Knight invites you to the banquet.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Preparing to hang out in the aristocratic circle, in order to brighten his eyes, Hudson also made up a lot of knowledge in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is it the Cheers Knight of the Harklian family?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the duplication rate of the nobles in the mainland of Aslante is too high, if you don't note the family, you can't tell them apart at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't figure out these things and come to be a guest rashly, it's easy to make a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, master.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guard's answer reassured Hudson. Without much hesitation, he replied directly: \"Tell the visitor, I will go there after I settle down.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Banquet\" is also a major feature of the aristocratic group. Whether it is making contacts, eating, drinking, having fun, or discussing matters, it can all be done at the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To judge the relationship of a family, just look at how many guests they hold at a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, Hudson has often accepted banquets. It's just not to exchange feelings, but to let him and his subordinates get out of here quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this kind of hurtful thing must not be said directly, a little hint is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles are the ones who pay the most attention to face. Unless it is absolutely necessary, everyone will not turn their faces on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, even if deep down in your heart you want to kill the other party immediately, you still have to show aristocratic demeanor on the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the face is publicly torn apart, it is basically to the point of endless death, and it is difficult to have room for maneuver.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why it is very difficult for a dude to survive three episodes. If you offend too many people, you will eventually meet the iron plate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a smart person, Hudson naturally won't offend people easily, and he is very face-saving every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the owner comes out to express his opinion, after purchasing the supplies, he must leave the camp and leave. If the master does not come out, then set up camp and train soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he strictly restrained military discipline, there was no trouble, everyone communicated harmoniously, and expanded a lot of contacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having experienced a lot, Hudson has gradually gotten used to the way nobles get along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arranged the affairs of the camp and came to the castle with a few attendants. The scene in front of him left Hudson speechless. This was probably the worst castle he had ever seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking of the rumors about the Chelsea Knight, Hudson is not surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight addicted to magic\", this is what everyone said to save face on the surface, but secretly he also has a title-\"Prodigal Son\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously without magical talent, but fantasizing about becoming a magician, doing messy research all day long, leaving nothing but nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just these things, it's over with everyone laughing. There are not a few nobles who are prodigal, and it is also a good thing to be able to reduce one competitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I love tossing, I love tossing, but this Chelsea knight has a very good talent for knight training. He is a rare great knight in Sack County, and he even hopes to become a silver knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, with his strength, a little effort can make the family business go further. However, Cheers Knight refused, even if he made a military exploit, he chose to convert it into a monetary reward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that all the money has been invested in magic research. Sometimes, in order to obtain magic materials, he can also join as a guest mercenary and work for the Mage Association.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strong strength, coupled with unorthodox experience, made Chelsea Knight a \"legendary\" figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the castle is dilapidated, Hudson believes that it is still very safe here. As long as the surrounding lords are not out of their minds, they will not come here to seek bad luck from a great knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is because of poverty. When encountering a poor man with such strength as Chelsea, even if he wins the battle, he can't squeeze out the oil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Redman, long time no see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hearty voice sounded, and Hudson's good mood suddenly disappeared, and he explained helplessly: \"Uncle Chells, I am Hudson, and Redman Jr. is my elder brother.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the most helpless place for Hudson. He really can't figure out why father and son should share the same name. However, this situation is very common in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for families with five generations under the same roof, if a family reunion is held, it is estimated that just distinguishing names can make people collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really don't know when my family got involved with Cheers, but I guess even if there is friendship, my father will not say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this man in front of him doesn't have a very good reputation in the aristocratic circle. The great knight's friendship is important, but it can't stand this guy who always likes to borrow money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the wallet, everyone chose to speak lightly and carefully to this bold knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it's just this little expense, it is estimated that most of the nobles will keep up for the sake of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the energy source of the magic lamp must be a magic spar, or a magic core. It is unknown how much Hudson will consume, but it will definitely not be cheap anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only magic lamps, but also dining tables and plates are magic items. As long as the food is placed on it, it can be automatically heated and cooked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more powerful is that after the cooking is completed, the dinner plate can automatically fly to the guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is a test of responsiveness. If it is not caught in time, there is a high probability of an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, two unlucky guys were too fascinated to watch, let their heads and dinner plates come into close contact, and they got food all over their bodies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of watching the excitement, everyone is immersed in the mysteries of magic. Including Hudson is no exception, he really did not expect that magic technology has developed to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe feeling that he has achieved his goal, Cheers, the protagonist, walked into the hall and said: \"Welcome everyone to the Magic Castle, I hope you can have a wonderful night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the magic items here are researched by me. If you are interested, you can order them from the housekeeper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, the price will not be too expensive. Those who can participate in the banquet this time are all my old friends of Chelsea, and I will definitely give everyone a discount...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good banquet turned into a product recommendation meeting, and Hudson had nothing to say. But what is certain is that Cheers Knight is not a good salesman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purchasing power of nobles is strong, but all the people attending the banquet are a group of small nobles. Even if they have money in their pockets, everyone is more willing to expand their armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanton enjoyment, it is a pity that this is not the treatment that low-level nobles should have. Although they stand tall in front of the common people, looking at the whole world, everyone is also trying to survive in the slits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The customer target positioning is wrong, even if it is a real discount and big sale, it is difficult to achieve the desired effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you change your thinking, the researched items are all weapons of war, and I am afraid that they will be overthrown immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the scene suddenly turned cold, Hudson took advantage of the situation and asked: \"Uncle Chells, you should introduce the consumption of these items first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic core and magic spar are strategic materials, and the kingdom controls them very strictly. If the consumption is too great, we cannot afford it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affordable but not affordable, this is the main reason why the magic department cannot be promoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention these daily necessities, even the magic crystal cannon, a weapon of war, cannot be popularized because of the cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, it is not that there have been some dazzling magic technologies, but due to the limitations of applicability, most of them are just short-lived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really about technological content, who can compare to the madmen of the Masters Association? They have created a separate profession—alchemist, who is responsible for messy research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these research results of Cheers are good, compared with the alchemists in the Mage Association, they are not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others didn't do these things, not because they couldn't do it, but because it wasn't necessary at all. These little tricks in front of me can be done by high-level mages by casting their own spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Cheers can reduce the cost, all these inventions in front of him are tasteless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is no small miracle that Cheers, who has no magical talent, can change to an alchemist. If it is promoted, it will be of great help to the development of the magic alchemy industry in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But none of this has anything to do with Hudson. If Chelsea's research could release magic, he would probably be interested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has a wizard dream, and Hudson is no exception. Even if you don't consider other factors, if you just start from safety, you can be a magician, who wants to be a human shield!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you study military history, you know that the mage group has always been strictly protected. Even if they lose a battle, it is the first \"strategic shift\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Desperately, that doesn't exist. There is no law stating that mages must fight to the death. In this aspect of preferential treatment, I am afraid that only priests can match it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, everyone. These things don't require much magic power. You only need a lowest-level magic core or a high-level crystal to keep the magic dining table running for a month and the magic lamp lighting for a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The installation cost of materials is not high. Only 1,500 gold coins are needed to make four magic lamps and a magic dining table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, when you hold a banquet, take out these high-tech and amaze all the guests in an instant, isn't it worth the money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Believe me, the price is definitely the lowest in the entire continent, and you can't lose money if you don't buy it, and you can't be fooled by it…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers tried his best to agitate, but unfortunately the scene was silent. Nobles pay attention to face-to-face, but everyone is not a stubborn one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spending a huge sum of 1,500 gold coins, just to pretend to be a force, so the future will not be able to survive?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still a small amount, and the maintenance and driving in the future will also cost a lot of money. It is estimated that if there are no thousand and eight hundred gold coins in a year, there is no way to get them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once again in the cold, this wave of Hudson did not dare to open up the atmosphere. The Koslow family is also a small family. If he dares to promise to order a set, it is estimated that Baron Redman can come to clean up the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one responded for a long time, and Chelsea's originally eager face gradually cooled down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, this time he really didn't ask for prices indiscriminately. If it weren't for the financial problems of the territory, he wouldn't have sold it in tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the winking eyes were cast on the blind man. None of the nobles in front of him knew what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, reason prevailed, and after barely suppressing his anger, Cheers sighed and said, \"Okay, now the banquet begins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing that the banquet started, the originally tense hall suddenly became lively, as if nothing had happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all a group of good actors, and Hudson is no exception. He found a relatively pleasing small circle to join in, and started the bragging mode of all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles went to answer the call, and it won't be long before everyone will become comrades-in-arms. It's not wrong to exchange information and communicate feelings in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out and not wanting to be bullied, grouping together is the best choice. If the dozens of nobles present were united, there would be thousands of people, and even Earl Pierce would have to take a high look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 14": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 14: temporary alliance\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 14 Temporary Alliance\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sense of presence all the way, Hudson can be regarded as a duck to water. The nobles present were not ordinary people, and all of them spoke nicely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dogs look down on people, provoke, despise and hate. There is no shadow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the youngest player, Hudson is still very popular among the crowd. If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, I guess I would have sold my daughter to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that all the big men attended the banquet, and none of the expected ladies and noble ladies appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to do this. Who will bring their family members when they go out? The outsiders did not bring their family members, and the nearby nobles naturally did not bring their female companions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone came here to exchange feelings and hug each other to keep warm. In the face of the pressure of survival, all the romance and love have to lean back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eating dark dishes, Hudson despised Chelsea's invention more and more. The magic dining table can be pretentious, but the taste is really hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is normal, just like the unmanned cooking machine in the previous life. All the ingredients and side dishes are put in according to the most scientific ratio, and the final food is just barely swallowable, without soul at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Cheers drinking alone, Hudson picked up the glass and walked over with an idea, and said with a smile: \"Uncle Cheers, are you going to change your career to become a bard?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers, who was already unhappy, became more and more gloomy when he heard this, and his eyes were no longer kind when he looked at Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bard\" seems to have a bright future, but it is actually not a good job. In the eyes of the nobles, they are a group of guys who are full and have nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to listen to stories, but any child from the family who became a bard has been ridiculed for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The joke went too far, Hudson didn't panic at all, and continued to calmly say: \"Uncle Cheers, there is a chance to make a fortune, I wonder if you are interested?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that he wasn't joking, Cheers' anger that had risen was instantly extinguished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, I did a magic experiment and accidentally overdid it, which caused the territory's finances to be on the verge of bankruptcy. If he doesn't find a solution as soon as possible, thousands of people will starve together with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to raise money, his beard is almost graying. However, the house was leaking and it was raining all night, and Earl Pierce's call-up order made Cheers nowhere to borrow money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are a waste of money. For this kind of compulsory recruitment, they all bring their own dry food to participate in the war, and all expenses are borne by the noble lords themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can tell from the intensity of mobilization that everyone will have to tighten their belts to live. Even if you still have spare energy, you should keep it in case of a rainy day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanted to borrow money, but couldn't open his mouth. The pressure on Chelsea can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the territory really goes bankrupt, he, the lord, will be over. Aristocrats not only enjoy rights, but also have obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how successful the education of enslavement is, it must fill the stomachs of the local people, and at least guarantee the minimum survival line. Otherwise, people will rebel if they are hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers also has a wife and children, so he would never dare to lose his family business. As a last resort, there is today's banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the current point of view, this wave is already a blood loss. They didn't sell anything, but they lost the money for holding the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mosquitoes are meat no matter how small they are. For Chelsea, who is on the verge of bankruptcy, holding a banquet is not a small expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing that there was a chance to get rich, Cheers didn't hesitate, and immediately asked: \"Hudson, my cutest nephew, what is the chance to get rich you are talking about?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking a sip of wine, Hudson replied calmly: \"Of course it's war money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scale of this rebellion is not small, and the accumulation of many nobles and wealthy businessmen has fallen into the hands of the rebels. Now these guys are very rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they are wiped out, we will surely gain a lot. If you are lucky and catch a few big fish, it will be **** money. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting the answer, Chelsea's interest suddenly dropped, and he said angrily: \"Hudson, you are still too young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War money, everyone knows. But do you think there are a few people who made a fortune through war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much loot there is, it belongs to the big shots above. We can only pick up some leftovers, and we can't even make up for the cost of dispatching troops, so how can we talk about getting rich! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a fact. Since ancient times, few have made a fortune through war. It's not that there is no wealth in the war, the main reason is that the wealth has been divided up by the powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the little nobles can drink the soup, it means that the bosses above have a conscience. When they meet the master who eats alone, they can't even drink the bath water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Chelsea, don't worry!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In the end, the world still has to use its strength to speak. We naturally have no right to speak on the battlefield alone, but if we unite, it will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more than 30 noble families present today, and if everyone gathers their soldiers and horses, there are thousands of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Uncle Cheers can take the lead and unite everyone, there will be a place for us on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you may be able to fight for a single area. At that time, how to divide the loot, isn't it up to us? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried his best to bewitch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was not prepared to do anything, but the opportunity came to him, and he would be a fool if he didn't know how to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the low title and poor status of Knight Cheers, he is too powerful to hold him back, and his influence among the nobles is not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are willing to take the lead in forming an alliance, few of the nobles present can refuse. After all, no one wants to be cannon fodder on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the alliance, at least they can send representatives to participate in the military meeting, so as not to lose sight of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the existence of the alliance, will it cause displeasure to the big men above? What does that have to do with Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the sky fell, the tall man was the first to bear it. He won't be the boss, as a small person, who has nothing to do to pay attention to him when he is full?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is everyone really willing to join?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to let him fight, and it's okay to do research, but it's really embarrassing for him to play politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of mixing, not only failed to carry forward the family business, but on the contrary made it on the verge of bankruptcy, which is enough to explain many problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why do you reject something that is beneficial?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson smiled and threw the question back. The communication just now was not in vain, and he also imitated the little thoughts of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't been sure, Hudson would not have run over to tease Knight Cheers. After all, offending a great knight is also very troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Cheers suddenly let out a sigh of relief, as if he had made a major decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, I've done this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The drinking and meat friends around suddenly became \"one of my own\", and the atmosphere of the banquet was pushed to a climax again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching everyone celebrating wildly, Hudson, who was all smiles on his face, shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that this is the world's most sloppy military alliance. There is no agreement on the respective rights and obligations, and the alliance is announced directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much effect it can play depends on everyone's integrity. When it comes to the battlefield, Hudson has no idea whether he can be reliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the case of the same interests, it can barely be regarded as an alliance. If there is a conflict of interest, it will fall apart in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, Hudson still feels that this alliance is very valuable. Among other things, the problems of passive sabotage and smuggling will be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Earl Pierce is not stupid, he won't get into it. After all, rules are always for the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 30 knights + thousands of soldiers, looking at the entire southeastern province is not a small force. If we continue to carry forward the tradition of being a unit of nobles, we can continue to recruit people to join us along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although such a loose alliance does not have much combat effectiveness, it can be scary! Especially for the upper-level rulers, not only the power of the alliance on paper must be considered, but also the influence of the families of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Hudson was thinking about what to do next, Knight Cheers suddenly walked over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Hudson, you seem to have something on your mind?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he seems to be in a good mood now. They all care about the little details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, I also like magic research, but because I don't have the materials, I want to exchange some magic cores or magic crystals with you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, magic cores and magic spar are hard currencies, which are more effective than any gold or silver coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the specifications of gold and silver coins issued by different countries are different. Some powerful nobles also mint their own coins, and the value of the coins is often affected by the conscience of the miners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When conducting international trade settlement, currency conversion is very difficult. For many large-value currency settlements, everyone likes to use magic spar or magic cores with more stable values.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the role of magic spar and magic core in war, as well as their special effects on magicians, alchemists and other industries, it directly leads to the fact that the two are rarely circulated in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, Hudson thought he could buy it if he had money, but after learning the real situation, he decisively chose to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by many factors, even if there is an occasional outflow, it will often be sold at a sky-high price, and the price/performance ratio is pitifully low. If you want to obtain it on a large scale, you can only rely on relationships to trade secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, the price at which the Mages Association obtains these two strategic resources from the Kingdom is only one-third of the retail price on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are quotas for nobles to exchange for, the prerequisite is to become a magician first. Under this background, even if the ordinary minor nobles have collections, the quantity will definitely not be many, and they will not trade them unless necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Cheers knight in front of me is engaged in magic research every day, and has developed so many tasteless magic technologies. These two things must be in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that Cheers Knight is short of money now, and all the magic technology has been sold, and the magic core and spar driven by it can naturally be traded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you are still young. Listen to my uncle's advice, don't learn from me to do these messy things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic research is a bottomless pit, and no amount of wealth is enough to fill it. Don't waste your time and money on this unless you have excellent magical talent. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be heard that these words are sincere. Having personally stepped on the sinkhole of magic research, Cheers really didn't want to see Hudson follow in his footsteps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing about \"magic talent\", Hudson had an idea and thought to himself: Maybe he should work hard to become a magician.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a waste of money. Knights engage in magic research, which is not doing their job properly. But it is reasonable for magicians to do these researches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sadly Hudson has never been exposed to magic, let alone used it. Glancing at Chelsea, Hudson instantly had an idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have the magician's cultivation method, which doesn't mean that this person in front of me doesn't have it either. Just looking at the pile of magic items in the hall, you can tell that Cheers Knight definitely does not lack theoretical knowledge in this area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, you should know how to test your magic talent, how about helping me test it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to figure out how to use cheats, he also struggled. He just sold a big favor to Knight Cheers, and now is his best chance to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe seeing Hudson's determination, or maybe just testing his talent, it doesn't take much effort, Cheers Knight nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The magic talent test is very simple. You only need to put a magic spar with no obvious attributes in your hand, and then mobilize your mental power to absorb the magic power in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have magic talent, the magic power in the spar will slowly flow into your body, and the speed of inflow determines the quality of your talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this test method is not completely accurate, there may be some errors, and it is impossible to detect specific talent attributes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to accurately test a person's magical talent, you still have to go to the Mage Association. The procedure is also very simple, as long as you pay a test fee of 100 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the talent is acceptable, the test fee can be exempted if you are admitted to the Masters Association. Of course, that's only for children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training of magicians should start from an early age. Once they are over fifteen years old, the Mage Association will not accept them. Unless you can teach yourself to become a magician, you can't get certified. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, seeing that Hudson was still unmoved, Cheers sighed deeply. From Hudson, he saw the shadow of his youth, the same persistence and self-confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that magic cultivation depends on talent, and 95% of them don't have the talent for magic cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire Alpha Kingdom, there are less than 500 registered magicians, including half of the magic apprentices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also related to the talent selection model. The high cost of testing directly blocks a large number of poor people from the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the national talent test is carried out, it is estimated that within ten years, the number of mages in the kingdom will be followed by a zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is impossible. Whether it is the king or the noble group, it is impossible to let the extraordinary power spread to the lower classes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, with the number of magicians in the kingdom, even if they wanted to conduct a national talent test, they would not be too busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After laying the groundwork so much in the early stage, this scene turned out to be beyond his imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson on the side was also very helpless. Just as he started to mobilize his mental power, the magic spar was sucked dry, and it was too late to control it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only gain is that the compass in my mind has solidified a bit, but this change is too weak, if you don't observe it carefully, you will definitely ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, it's because the spar hasn't been well preserved, the magic power in it has already been exhausted, and the last trace of it was absorbed by me just now, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to quibble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pockets are not rich, and a magic spar costs dozens of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Cheers, who reacted, also nodded. Although a bit far-fetched, this is also the most reasonable explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never heard of it, the magic talent test can **** up a spar. Under normal circumstances, this magic spar is enough for a junior magician to replenish his magic power three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can **** up a magic spar in an instant, unless the Dharma Saint is alive. Obviously, this is impossible, and the legendary Dharma saint has not appeared for thousands of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What he couldn't understand was that the magic spar was fine just now, it didn't look like its magic power was about to be exhausted, why it disappeared all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the people from the Mage Association did the trick?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just for no reason. Why did those research madmen make such a prank?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the origin of this magic spar, but did not find any clues, Cheers sighed helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing can only be considered unlucky, and there is no way to get to the bottom of it. Even if it was confirmed that it was a prank by a certain boss in the Mage Association, he could only admit it through gritted teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Broke his fortune, which made the poor Cheers Knight even worse. Glancing at the puzzled Hudson, he said helplessly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I only have one non-attribute magic spar here, so I can't give you another test. But judging from the situation just now, you should have the talent for magic cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For specific talent attributes, you should find an opportunity to go to the Mage Association to test it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basic meditation methods and mantras, I also have them here. If you want, I can make a copy for you, but this is for a fee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of the Mage Association is 100 gold coins. For the sake of friendship with your father, I can give you a 20% discount. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but Hudson always feels that when the price is being negotiated, Cheers Knight is a bit guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether there are pits, Hudson does not know. But in order to obtain the magic spar and magic core reasonably, even if he knew it was a pit, he could only jump into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then thank you, Uncle Cheers. But it's best if you sell me a few magic cores and crystals by the way. It would be better if they have different attributes.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be excited and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having the opportunity to become a magician is definitely a joy for a teenager. In order to achieve his goal, Hudson decided to carry out the pretense to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing Hudson's firm attitude, or perhaps to raise funds to make up for the shortfall, Cheers said slowly: \"Alright then!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson, you have to think clearly. Magic crystals and magic cores are not cheap, and I don't have any good ones here. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Cheers opened a box, took out his collection, and said to Hudson:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I won't cheat you, I will follow the market price. 50 gold coins for the first-level magic core, 150 gold coins for the second-level magic core, 20 gold coins for the low-level magic spar, 50 gold coins for the intermediate magic spar, and extra money for special attributes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for higher-grade ones, I don't have them here either, and you won't be able to use them for the time being. After you become a magician, it's not too late to find a way to do it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the words, Cheers also showed a hint of envy. As a magic madman, lack of magic talent is his biggest pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is this kind of \"pain\", which is purely hypocritical in the eyes of the outside world. A good talented knight is not suitable, but he wants to smash a magician, which is completely out of his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many people, if Cheers hadn't jumped into the sinkhole of magic research, he would have become a silver knight by now, and the golden knight at the top would also have a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Hudson directly selected twelve low-level magic spar, plus a first-level magic core.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other things, the greed is the greed, but the pockets are not rich. You can only choose as cost-effective as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic power in a mid-level magic spar is almost twice that of a low-level magic spar, which is about the same as a first-level magic core. But the price is 250%, the main reason is that the magic power contained in it is more pure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For ordinary magicians, the purer the magic power in the crystal nucleus, the easier it is to extract. Whether it is making a magic circle or a magic crystal cannon, it is necessary to consider the extraction of magic power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is different, his golden fingers are not picky eaters, they can absorb magic power when they see it, and it doesn't matter whether the magic power is pure or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that there were only twelve low-level magic crystals here, he would have bought a few more. As for the magic core, it was purely out of curiosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the last time, it was absorbed in a daze, this time Hudson is ready to study it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For him who traveled from a technological society, magic spar is very easy to understand, it is a mineral that contains energy. It is nothing more than a more mysterious application than coal, oil and other energy sources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the magic core is different. This thing grows in the body of the Warcraft. It is pure and natural without any additions, and it has powerful power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Existence is reasonable, beyond the scope of cognition, it can only prove that one's cognition is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Meditation gate and basic spells cost 80 gold coins, twelve low-level magic crystals cost 240 gold coins, plus a first-order magic core costs 50 gold coins, totaling 370 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, you have to think about it. That's a lot of money, and I'm not going to refund the fee once the deal is done. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea reminded cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As someone who has experienced it, he is very aware of the magical power of magic, lest Hudson be impulsive and embezzle the military expenses for this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as an outsider, it is not easy to speak out directly. After all, aristocrats want face, and to say it directly is to question Hudson's ability to pay, or his character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the scene in front of him, Hudson could only complain secretly. After all, he is still too young. If he is a few years older, the use of this money will not attract attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Chelsea. I know what I'm doing, and I won't make fun of the Koslow family's thousand-year reputation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already opened the gold coin box that had been prepared, counted the amount and handed it over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Its specific function is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this bit of magic power is far from satisfying the appetite of the big eater, and Hudson is about to collapse. If it wasn't for the slight improvement in his physique, he would have been ready to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The golden finger was no longer available, and Hudson had to continue to be cautious. Set up camp and wait for all the people in the alliance to gather before going on the road again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the gorgeous flags and the crumbling teams under the flags, Hudson didn't know how to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought my own family was bad enough, but I didn't expect there to be worse. In the entire league, except for a few two or three teams who can barely watch, the rest are garbage among garbage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a secret comparison, Hudson found that in terms of strength, his own mob can actually rank in the top five in the temporary alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not because of strong combat effectiveness, but because of the large number of people. They are also recruited, and the military obligations that different territories need to undertake are also different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of the same mob, it is natural that the strength of the more people is stronger. Hudson, who wanted to paddle, never dreamed that his family could become the \"main force\" in the league.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is embarrassing. I am afraid that no one can tell whether such a mob is going to suppress the rebellion or to send the head to the rebel army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that there are too many smart people in this world. After realizing something was wrong, each of them chose to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a group of smart people gathered together, this grand occasion of \"crowd gathering\" appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the background that paddling has become the mainstream, honest mobilization has become an alternative. Of course, \"alternative\" is not a derogatory term here, and everyone \"respects\" those few who have made money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose an ally, naturally an honest person is better. A group of nobles, including Hudson, have tacitly started the touting mode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the true thoughts in the heart, it doesn't matter. Anyway, in the next war, they will be the \"armed force\" of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as the titular leader, Knight Cheers is also responsible for force. It's just that he is in charge of personal force, while others are in charge of group force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made Chelsea poor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of wealth has been invested in the bottomless pit of magic research, so naturally there is no financial resources to develop armaments. Even the frontier guards are serving serfs, and the force in the territory is himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among all the private armies of the nobles, Cheers's troops are the most rubbish. All bamboo spear equipment, not even a pair of armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Equipment is garbage, and the key sergeants are also a bunch of crooked melons. The scattered formation, one can tell at a glance that they have never been trained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary people are afraid of comparison. Under the background of all his allies, Hudson suddenly found that his army has become an \"elite division\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least judging from the marching ranks, the Koslow family's team is the only one keeping the formation. Unlike other aristocratic private armies, every time they set up camp, they have to look for people everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many teammates added, the marching speed naturally dropped again and again. Seeing that the time for the required assembly was approaching, no one was in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is calm, and Hudson is too lazy to be the first bird. The law does not blame the crowd is also applicable in the continent of Aslante, especially they are still noble nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the current political system, there is no general preferential treatment for nobles. Earl Pierce is capable of punishing a single nobleman, but he absolutely dare not punish a group of noblemen at the same time. Otherwise, if there is a commotion, it will definitely alarm the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, the central government and local princes have had irreconcilable conflicts. How to suppress the local nobles is a compulsory course for every king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the stability of the kingdom and the balance of power, successive kings never forgot to add sand to the local area. The most intolerable thing is that the local area is monolithic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this general principle, the relationship between the local nobles and the small and medium-sized nobles will naturally not be harmonious, and they dare not be too harmonious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking through all this, Hudson suddenly understood what his colleagues were doing. A little fuss, which seems very nonsensical, is actually a manifestation of political wisdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, we can't say how clever everyone is. Most people do it because they are used to it. Maybe they don't want to be late, but the low efficiency prevents them from catching up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the real directors of all this are the big nobles above. Generation after generation of hard work and generation after generation of indulgence have led to the current situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transposition, Hudson will do the same. Deliberately creating a situation where local control is not strict is the best way to eliminate the king's suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this situation, which has changed in recent decades. With the passage of time, the accumulated strength of the local princes has become stronger and stronger, and the advantages of the royal family are no longer obvious. All kinds of tentative little moves gradually increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are Hudson's inferences. The information in hand is limited, and the understanding of the upper class is not enough, so the conclusions drawn may not be accurate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ethel Fortress, with the arrival of Earl Pierce's army, this place has become the headquarters of the counter-insurgency army, and it has also become the front line to prevent the rebels from advancing westward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leadership is the embodiment of chivalry. Although Earl Pierce did not personally lead the charge, he still went to the front line to command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After defending the city for many days, Earl Pierce was also exhausted. The plan has never changed quickly. Originally thought that the rebels were just mobs and nothing to worry about. They wanted to take advantage of the chaos to make profits, so they let the rebels grow bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't expect the skeleton to play a big game. First, the nobles in Dadir City were slaughtered, and then the rebels quickly swept across the countryside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Earl Pierce could react, the rebel army swept across the two counties of Wright and Wyton, and their soldiers pointed directly at Beda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counties of Wright and Wyton are nothing more than that. Anyway, most of them are fiefdoms of other nobles, and a few unlucky vassals have been affected, and Earl Pierce can afford to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kebeida is different. This place is already the core fiefdom of his Dalton family. Once it falls into the hands of the rebels, it will be a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Earl Pierce could only issue a call-up order, and at the same time personally lead an army to meet the enemy, defending the enemy at Fort Ethel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where did the reinforcements of the nobles go, and how long will it take to arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked, frowning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Dalton family is afraid of rebels, but wars are ultimately deadly. This group of rebels in front of them is obviously not an idler. If they fight head-on with the enemy, even if they can win, they will inevitably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world of the jungle, strength is fundamental. If the strength of the Dalton family is greatly damaged, it is unknown how many hungry wolves will pounce on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce his own losses, Earl Pierce chose not to hold out even though he clearly had the strength to defeat the rebels outside the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

No wonder Earl Pierce is angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was just angry. Before the rebels rose up, he sat on the mountain and watched the tiger fight to make a profit.

Although Earl Pierce had ordered the news to be blocked, it was of no use to the nobles who wanted to inquire about the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the nobles in the world belong to one family. Although Earl Pierce is the largest nobleman in the southeastern province, most of the knights under his command come from the families of small and medium nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps these people will not betray the lord, but it is still very possible to pass some information to the family. It's impossible to expect everyone to be 100% loyal, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fool!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is a bunch of idiots!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The longer it takes, the stronger the rebel army will be. When the time comes to fight, there will be good fruits for them...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce scolded angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has already made up his mind to give a good blow to this group of small and medium-sized nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just want to think about it, but the specific operation is very troublesome. All of them were passive and sabotaged, and let him, the boss, go shopping with the rebels on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though there are thousands of calculations, people just can't come, and Pierce didn't give up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't let the rebels go there, looking for the bad luck of the nobles, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really do this, I am afraid that all the nobles will be overjoyed. According to the style of the rebels, the Dalton family was basically cold after a bloodbath all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles enjoy many special features, but also undertake corresponding obligations. Just look at the nobles of Wright and Wyton Counties, almost all of them were killed in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a fish that slips through the net, in the world of nobles, it is still a \"dead person\". \"Responsibility for guarding the land\" is the most basic obligation of nobles, and you can't just run if you want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing the territory is equivalent to losing everything of the nobles. The noble status and family glory were all lost in one wave. The cruel reality forced them to stay and do their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the children outside are not counted. These are the seeds. In case of accidents, the children of nobles living outside can still inherit the title and revive the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, now is not the time to pursue responsibility. The most urgent task is to urge the nobles from all over the country to lead the army to reinforce as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Fort Essel is strong, it cannot completely stop the progress of the rebels. If the enemy bypassed the castle and divided their troops into Beda to make trouble, it would be a big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged officer reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not alarmist talk, as a rebel, you don't need to talk about the rules of the game. Anyway, there is no stable rear, and it doesn't really matter to the rebels whether there is a rear or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, no matter whether Earl Pierce is willing or not, he can only show his family background and fight the rebels to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Earl Pierce, who came to his senses, looked at the rebel camp outside the castle, and said ruthlessly: \"The order is passed on, ordering all the nobles to come within three days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell them that the two counties of Wyton and Wright, which were plagued by the rebels, are waiting for them to come and take them. As long as they made great contributions in the next battle, the unowned fiefdom would be their spoils of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I guarantee with the honor of the Dalton family: I will report the truth to the capital to ensure that every meritorious official receives a matching treatment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have to bear the troubles you cause yourself. If you want to mix in the noble circle, you must abide by some rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to save the situation, Earl Pierce had to spend all his money. After all, this wave of fun is too big for his family to handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land of the two counties, even if he wanted to monopolize it, the capital would not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trying not to find a way to get the local nobles to endorse it together, the Dalton family can't bear the pressure, and maybe the royal family will intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the royal family gets caught and takes the opportunity to entrust a prince, it will be hard to say who is the boss in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce is not in vain to be able to secure a position among the princes. After sorting out the interests that may be involved, he decisively made a choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the speed drops and advances ten miles a day, the march becomes a tour of mountains and rivers. The tense war atmosphere no longer exists, but the atmosphere of entertainment is getting stronger day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, the team of the alliance has grown rapidly, and more and more nobles have joined the group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people may not be powerful, but the news must be well-informed. After everyone mobilized contacts to inquire deliberately, more and more information came, and everyone gradually understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information became transparent, and the nobles, including Hudson, let go of their worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment of silence for the hapless nobles of Wright and Wyton counties, everyone criticized Earl Pierce, wanting to eat his flesh and drink his blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is limited to verbal criticism. It is still difficult for everyone to come forward and uphold justice. After all, everyone is a smart person, and they know how much they are capable of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing we can do is to continue to slow down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the rebellion was indulged by Earl Pierce, he has to be responsible for the aftermath, otherwise the kingdom will be held accountable and there will be no good fruit for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are people on the front line, and the rebels will not harm their own land, so everyone will not panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of delaying the date, everyone has already figured out a countermeasure, and the excuses are all ready-rebel raids.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a rebel attack, then there will be, the truth is not important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce has an inescapable responsibility for the rebellion, which is equivalent to a ready-made handle, and there is no way to get to the bottom of this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until Earl Pierce's military order came again that the situation changed. Compared with the purely compulsory service before, there are now promises of rewards in kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The aristocrats of Wright and Wyton counties were in distress, and the extinct nobles were not one family. It is impossible not to be tempted by such a large piece of cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One moment everyone was still sympathizing with the tragic experience of the nobles of the two counties, and the next moment they were already sharpening their knives, wanting to share a piece of meat in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Earl Pierce, who was criticized by everyone, suddenly became taller in everyone's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cursing, criticizing, and denouncing, in addition to the complicated feelings of the rabbit's death and the fox's grief, the most important thing is that the Dalton family eats alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that Earl Pierce has made a promise to share the meat with everyone, the situation is quite different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was just a personal promise, everyone might still doubt it. After all, Earl Pierce's character is not good, and he may go back on his word at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the guarantee of family glory, the situation is completely different. No nobleman dares to make fun of his own glory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world where glory is higher than life, the cost of breaching a contract is simply too high. Once it happens, you can only retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the eager eyes of all his allies, Hudson knew he couldn't stop it. If everyone can't restrain the greed in their hearts, something big will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the rebel army is really easy to deal with, why should Earl Pierce share the benefits with everyone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the few nobles in the kingdom, the Dalton family is not vegetarian. Whether it is strength or personal connections, it is not comparable to the small nobles in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the rebellion is extinguished quickly, the kingdom is not given a chance to intervene. Even if they can't monopolize the two counties, at least they can swallow half of the counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that it is so generously shared, everyone is attracted to it. It would be good if the Dalton family could get one-tenth of it, or even less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countless marriages between nobles, even if the nobles of the two counties die, relatives can make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of miles away, the whip is beyond reach, let alone, but the local nobles will not give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay not to let them intervene, but if you let them in, then a fight between dragons and tigers will be inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how far the relationship is, as long as it conforms to the laws of the kingdom and there is an inheritance relationship, then they can jump out and fight for the right of inheritance. When everyone is done fighting, the remaining unclaimed land is the real loot that can be divided up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson is sorting out the network of relatives, looking for nobles in these two counties who can be related to his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the advantage of the Koslow family's thriving population is reflected. Not only did the in-laws find several families, but even the same clan had two families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are not enough. If there is a relationship involved, the issue of succession has to be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal inheritance order, it is basically not Hudson's turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are exceptions to everything. As long as the other party has no direct heirs, the succession order of collateral distant relatives is a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is the support of the great nobles, it is completely possible to inherit the title first and create an established fact before the other heirs react.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will definitely be future troubles, but compared with the title, it is worth taking a little risk. The big deal is to slowly argue after the fact, as long as the vested interests endorse each other, this is a muddled account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main thing is that the land of the kingdom is owned, and the threshold set by vested interest groups for latecomers is very high. With the little credit for putting down the rebellion, at most a few knights will be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to obtain a title by military merit, you can only win a foreign war, and the fief is still on the turbulent border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this, everyone wouldn't immediately change their political positions as soon as Earl Pierce showed goodwill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The discussion scene was too heated. Some impatient nobles had already taken out their treasured maps and clamored to divide the spoils in advance, as if the rebels no longer existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the titular boss of Cheers Knight, he couldn't control the situation at all. A good alliance party has been directly reduced to a market for bargaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't rush to join the discussion. The area of ​​Wyton and Wright counties is indeed not small, but there are so many wolves who can't hold back and want to divide the meat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to satisfy everyone, and it is doomed that no result can be discussed now. Even if an agreement can be barely reached, it will not be accurate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the temporary alliance is only a small part of the many nobles. Even if they can hold a group to keep warm, they still have a limited right to speak, and it is impossible for them to do everything they want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"stop!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, now is not the time to discuss these issues. The governor's military order clearly stipulates that we must arrive at the front line within three days. If we fail to arrive on time, even if we are not punished, I am afraid that the final spoils will have nothing to do with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, we are still more than a hundred miles away from Fort Ethel, so there is no extra time to waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the fief issue that everyone is concerned about, I think there is no point in discussing it now. There are so many nobles in the southeast province, no amount of spoils can be shared by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is doomed to only a few people who can get what they want. The distribution plan, if you want to convince everyone, you will inevitably talk about your military achievements in the end. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea's words were like a basin of cold water, pouring on everyone. The originally lively scene fell silent in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is not a fool, it was just a sudden good news, and I was too emotional for a while. Now that he has reacted, he immediately realizes the seriousness of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce is not easy to deal with. To be able to share such a large profit, it is obvious that everyone will work hard in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have enough military merits, you might not even be eligible to serve on the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inheritance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone agrees that the direct heirs are the rules of the game. Distant relatives and collateral heirs, then we have to talk about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It didn't come out of the cracks in the rocks. Who doesn't have a group of relatives?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many people who are eligible to participate in the battle for inheritance rights. If you don't come up with something convincing, why let you pick up this bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves core interests, and no one will give in easily. Even the original allies may become competitors in the next moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all plots in front of everyone. If you want to fight for the inheritance left by the extinct nobles, you have to fight desperately on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson had to admit that Earl Pierce made a good move, which revived the passive chess game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the mixed reactions of the crowd, you can tell that everyone is preparing to spend their money on this wave. If there is no accident, the next step is to activate the great summoning technique to bring the main force of the family over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area of ​​the Southeast Province is not too large. Theoretically speaking, by passing the news back now, most of the elite nobles can rush over before everyone reaches the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Others can shake people, but he can't follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Baron Redman gets to know this news, he will probably bring his guards over immediately, and then the leadership will change hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a father who is a traditional knight. He is good at everything in normal times, but it is dangerous on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson recalled the scene of launching a knight's charge with Baron Redman, Hudson flinched decisively. Compared with military exploits, he felt that his life was more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Survive is your own. If it is dead, no matter how great the military exploits are, it will be taken by someone else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the extraordinary world, it is no problem for a small group of elites to travel hundreds of miles a day. In an emergency, two or three hundred miles are fine, but untrained mobs can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has never practiced, and he is an ordinary person. Coupled with long-term malnutrition, most of these people are in a sub-healthy state. It is not difficult to march more than 100 miles in three days, but it is not too easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the speed is raised, problems begin to occur frequently. During the march, everyone didn't feel much, but when it was time to set up camp, the embarrassing scene of \"the soldiers don't know the generals, and the generals don't know the soldiers\" appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Koslow family is not bad. Thanks to Hudson's previous training, although the lineup is not to be mentioned, the soldiers finally did not get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that something happened when the final count of the number of people was counted. I don't know where more than 30 people jumped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officer in charge of counting the number went up to inquire about the situation, but these foolish **** couldn't even tell the full name of their lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If undercover agents weren't popular these days, Hudson would have treated them as spies. Of course, the most important thing is that no one will send this group of fools as spies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waited until the next morning to set off, and there were still twelve unclaimed soldiers, which made Hudson very speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the lords in the alliance have been photographed, so why are there more?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether those guys were confused and didn't recognize it, or other nobles missed it, it was difficult to draw a conclusion for a while, Hudson directly acquiesced to the fact that his strength + twelve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team continued to move forward, but everyone's interest was not very high. It can be seen that the accident last night taught everyone a good lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most obvious change is that everyone has sent cronies to watch the team, lest there will be another joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident. When the camp was set up in the evening, something went wrong. People from all walks of life in the alliance didn't know what was going on, but they still mixed together, waiting for a group of lords to lead them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farce was staged again, and the most direct impact was that Hudson's status in the league rose sharply, and he was hailed as an \"elite teacher\" by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical business bragging, Hudson naturally couldn't refuse. This is the \"elite teacher\" by comparison. If we deny this statement, wouldn't it appear that everyone is incompetent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who has passed the emotional intelligence, decisively accepted this statement, and even the morale of his soldiers also increased, as if he was a real \"elite teacher\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name is all false, and the real gain is that Hudson accepted the fact that \"strength + fifteen\" with tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he can be sure that there are other noble armies nearby besides the Alliance, and they are not far away. Otherwise, it cannot be explained, the fact that he has more and more soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just know that you know, Hudson is still fine. It's right to pick up other people's soldiers and make a fortune in silence. Wouldn't it be silly to take the initiative to send them back?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although such an approach is neither noble nor chivalrous, it is very Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more honest and obedient soldiers who don't need to be paid, the better in Hudson's view.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the \"high-intensity\" marching time was short, and it reached the front line on the third day. Otherwise, Hudson was really worried that the owners would come to the door one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Ethel Fortress not far away, the rebels rushed over before they could catch their breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't talk about martial arts, you don't have any chivalry.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson secretly complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to say, the enemies have all been killed, so naturally they can only fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Cavaliers have retreat in their dictionary, but there is no flight without a fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the nominal boss of the league, Chelsea gave orders without hesitation: \"Everyone follow me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, the boss rushed out in the first place. Immediately afterwards, all the nobles and lords responded one after another, showing the \"bravery\" of the knights with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Drop the army and launch a charge?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him directly refreshed Hudson's three views. There is no way, under the watchful eyes of everyone, Hudson does not dare to risk the dissatisfaction of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he was cautious enough to lead the army at the end of the team at the beginning. At this moment, the chaotic team ahead just blocked his way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was any other nobleman, he probably would have jumped on his horse, but Hudson, who has a compassionate spirit, would not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to appear different, the charge must be initiated. Glancing at the battlefield, Hudson ordered to his subordinates: \"Taylor, take the army and follow me to attack from the left.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson also rode out. At this moment, Cheers had rushed into the rebel army with a group of noble knights. It was just a face-to-face meeting, and the corpses of the seven or eight rebel soldiers standing in front were separated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Chelsea, the rebels are like paper. The noble knights who followed did not give way. Although they were not as sharp as Chelsea, they were not inferior to killing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching his own team kill the Quartet, Hudson's morale is also boosted. He couldn't help sighing: \"As expected of a great knight, the individual combat ability is strong.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know whether it was affected by the atmosphere of the battlefield or because the road ahead was not good, Hudson's mount suddenly changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he tried his best to recover, the circle around him was getting wider and wider. Although the distance between him and the rebels was getting closer, there was still a long way to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Naughty animal, how can you be so timid and brave? After the war is over, I will replace you as soon as possible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help scolding angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He just speaks loudly, but his body is very honest. After all, it was his own mount, so he still couldn't bear to give the horse a whip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching his comrades fighting on the front line, Hudson gave him helpless eyes. Seeing a lone enemy approaching, he immediately raised his knight spear and rushed over, killing him with one blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because the angle was not grasped properly, the moment the gun was drawn, blood sprayed all over Hudson's body, and the originally bright armor instantly changed its color.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing blood, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but was full of surprise. Finally broke through the zero record, and don't have to worry about being shameless when you look back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if he had unlocked the mysterious talent, Hudson has been wandering on the edge of the battlefield, playing tricks on the rebel soldiers who were also paddling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Witnessing two noble knights being pulled off their horses, Hudson once again strengthened his determination to \"go\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not caring about continuing to challenge the single bully, Hudson hurriedly joined his team and harassed the enemy on the left flank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rush in to rescue allies?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, Hudson decisively killed it. He is not leading any elites, and it is okay to bully the enemy army alone while fighting with the wind, but if he rushes in to fight the enemy, he will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the private army of the nobles, you can see that after the lord took the lead in charging, everyone followed blindly, and then became anxious with the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now if you want to reverse the situation, you must either wait for the army in the fortress to come out, or wait for other noble private troops to join the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today is the stipulated deadline, and the ambitious private army of nobles will arrive on time. Time is on your side. In theory, the longer it takes, the better it will be for the counter-insurgency army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But theory is theory after all, as time goes by, the noble knights who are trapped in the siege become more and more difficult to sustain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A charge to defeat the rebels is only a fantasy after all. The enemies in front of them seemed to have been injected with chicken blood, and they attacked them bravely without fear of death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to launch an effective attack, many rebel soldiers didn't even hide from the knights' counterattack, even if they accidentally injured their own people, they didn't care. Hudson personally saw a rebel soldier who would rather be shot than throw the weapon in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the quantity is in place, accuracy and hit rate are not important. No matter how powerful the knight is, he can't do a 360-degree defense without dead ends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The powerful knights were piled to death on the battlefield by the serfs who had just put down their hoes. I have to say that this is a kind of irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson regretted making any alliance. If it weren't for the existence of the alliance, would he still hide behind and watch the scenery?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter has come to this point, no matter how unwilling it is, I can only bite the bullet. In order to reduce his sense of existence, Hudson was forced to dismount from his horse and join the infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that there are fewer and fewer comrades in arms around him, the gallant Cheers knight gradually realized the seriousness of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These enemies are obviously abnormal, all of them are bloodthirsty, they don't care about their own life and death at all, they are not ordinary rebels at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"rush out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to show off your abilities. No matter how important military exploits are, they are not as important as life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of military command ability does not mean that political wisdom is also zero. Many nobles who charged along with him died, and if they continued to die like this, he would not be able to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Cheers has greeted Earl Pierce's ancestors for three generations. Fortunately, I came here to help you out of the siege. The battle has been fought to this extent, but I still haven't sent troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knights led by Cheers are the benchmarks on the battlefield. When they retreated, the morale of the noble allied forces collapsed instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the elites of each family who take the lead in running the road. It can be seen that the elites who can \"experience a hundred battles\" and survive are the kings of running.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, Hudson also retreated with his family. Because they had been walking on the edge of the battlefield, and there was no one blocking the way behind them, the retreat went extremely smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the defeat of the coalition of nobles, Earl Pierce in Fort Ethel suddenly realized that he was playing too big again. Send troops, you must send troops, if the rebels win a complete victory, the reinforcements will be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are not stupid. With the lessons learned from the past, the nobles who came behind might turn around and leave. Even if the lawsuit goes to the capital, it will be Pierce's fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Pierce was full of anger. In any case, he is also very resourceful, but when it comes to specific operations, there are always troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to use the rebels to weaken the strength of the nobles in Wright County, but they miscalculated the strength of the Skull and Bones, causing the rebels to plunder the two counties and directly make the situation out of control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just wanted to use the hands of the rebels to weaken the strength of the noble lords, but I didn't expect this group of noble coalition forces to be so useless, and they were defeated within an hour of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weaken too much, and it becomes an accident. There is a limit to everything, whether he wants to or not, he must send troops to rescue the remaining noble coalition forces now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, he will become the public enemy of the small and medium-sized nobles in the southeastern province. In the future, as the governor, he will be an empty shelf, and no one will listen to his orders at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering the elite in the fortress, Earl Pierce raised his knight gun, stepped on his mount Flaming Lion, raised his gun and gave an order: \"The evil skeletons will launch a rebellion, intending to subvert the kingdom's divine rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the stability of the kingdom, for the glory of the Lord of Dawn, and for our glory, the warriors of the Crimson Knights, follow me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The majestic fortress gate slowly opened, and the sun's brilliance sprinkled on the knight's gun, emitting bursts of cold light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce jumped out of the fort first with a lion, followed by more than two hundred knights, and then a thousand cavalry from the Crimson Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Qianqi galloped out, bursting out with an earth-shattering aura, which made people shudder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the cavalry attacking, the rebels who besieged the city took immediate measures. The pikemen were at the forefront, and the archers immediately fired all their arrows, and the rain of arrows enveloped the knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these are all in vain. Earl Pierce swung his gun and swept the sky full of arrows, protected himself and his mount tightly, and continued to charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When approaching the pikemen formation, the Flaming Lion suddenly spewed out a ball of magma-like stuff from its mouth, and the rebels who couldn't avoid it instantly turned into Pyromen. The soldiers around were so frightened that they dodged quickly, and the scene fell into chaos for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the chaotic moment of the rebel army, Earl Pierce also rushed into the rebel army, and with the cooperation of the flame lion, he killed all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By taking advantage of the gap opened by Earl Pierce, a group of knights also rushed in frantically, and the spear formation collapsed directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the army, the rebel army suffered heavy losses in an instant under the massacre of a group of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Earl Pierce obviously didn't have the time to harvest the small soldiers. He completely ignored the defeated soldiers and headed towards the enemy's commander-in-chief with his troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of military common sense knows that Earl Pierce is going to \"capture the king\" first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the cavalry approaching, the gray-robed old man watching the battle on the high platform sneered, \"The Crimson Knights are indeed the top ten knights of the Alpha Kingdom, and they are truly a weapon of war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rick, blow the horn of the blood moon, first let the cannon fodder and this group of annoying cavalry play slowly, and see how many they can kill. \"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Only killing remained in his eyes, as if he didn't know the pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that the faces of the rebel soldiers are all flushed, as if eating chili peppers on their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weirdest thing is the eyes of the rebel soldiers, emitting bursts of green light, like a demon from hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel army has turned on the crazy mode, which has suffered a lot from the noble coalition forces. Seeing the Crimson Knights attack just now, everyone had the courage to fight back with great difficulty, but now they were directly beaten and forced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is not afraid of death, so what can I do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the team was about to collapse, Hudson was about to wait for an opportunity to slip away, but the flag that suddenly appeared behind made him dispel this idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another noble private army is coming. It doesn't matter who is coming, and it doesn't matter how strong the coming is, as long as there are reinforcements to join, it is a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The addition of the new force stabilized the coalition of nobles who were on the verge of collapse. Although he was still being beaten back by the rebels, Hudson was not panicking at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first noble private army joins, and then there will be the second and third... Essentially, everyone is a grasshopper on the same rope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Crimson Knights have all come out, and now the decisive battle mode has been activated. If the coalition forces of nobles were defeated, it would be difficult for the entire southeastern province to stop the advance of the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames of war will eventually burn on their own land one day, and no one can think of being alone. If you don't work hard now, it will be too late to try hard later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the situation on the battlefield gradually stabilized, Hudson, as a paddling knight, had time to think.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mysterious horn sounded, and the enemy army became so crazy. There must be some connection between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what the mysterious horn is, I can be sure that it is not a fun thing. Any means of greatly stimulating individual potential will inevitably have its sequelae.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the rebel soldiers, you can tell that this is not just a mere stimulation potential, it is clearly a loss of self-awareness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't take much to think about it, even if these people survived the battlefield by chance, they are probably basically useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As expected of a cult organization, the attack is extraordinary!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After secretly sighing, Hudson silently increased his vigilance against Skull and Bones. These lunatics are really too harmful, much more destructive than some... cults in previous lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon Horn!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Impossible! This is impossible! The Horn of the Blood Moon was sealed in the Papal State three hundred years ago. How could it have fallen into the hands of the Skull and Bones?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recognized the source of the eerie sound, Earl Pierce still found it unbelievable. The evil thing that had been sealed by the church for three hundred years unexpectedly appeared in the hands of the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he suddenly understood why the rule of the nobles in Wyton and Wright Counties was easily overthrown by the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of the evil weapon of the Blood Moon Horn, even an honest serf can become a killing machine. Although the combat effectiveness is not very good, but the ants can't hold back and kill the elephants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like now, the **** fighters in the rebel army are all serfs called up temporarily, or poor people in the city. No matter how many people die, Skull and Bones will not feel bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the coalition of nobles is different, everyone is fighting the rebels with their own strength. If the losses are heavy, it may decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the Crimson Knights of Earl Pierce, each cavalryman was carefully selected and trained strictly for several years before forming an army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expenses during the period are by no means a small number. Even if it is a prince, it is difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the combat power is strong, known as the top ten knight orders in the kingdom, they only maintain a establishment of more than a thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every loss of one will hurt Earl Pierce. But now they have to spend this elite team with the enemy's cannon fodder, no matter how you look at it, it is a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Dalton family has a big business, it can't afford to keep fighting like this, let alone other small and medium noble families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send a signal to let all the troops in the fortress attack. Raise the **** battle flag, and I will fight the Skeleton Society forever in this battle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the threat of the Skull and Bones with the \"Blood Moon Horn\" is too great. If you don't take advantage of the Skull and Bones before it grows stronger, it will be difficult to make a move in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that three hundred years ago, the Blood Moon Sect used this evil weapon to disrupt the entire continent of Aslante. The once awesome Cister Empire perished because of this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, under the leadership of the church, all countries in the mainland jointly took action to kill the Blood Moon Cultists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon Horn\" cannot be destroyed because it is a divine weapon. In the end, the contemporary Pope used divine magic to seal it in the Holy Land of the Papal State, and it was guarded by the Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now this hot potato has appeared on his own territory. If he doesn't deal with it quickly, all major forces in the mainland will be attracted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various forces gathered to compete for the blood moon horn. Thinking about that scene, Earl Pierce felt his scalp go numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to regret, I still regret it. If I had known that the Skull and Bones had the \"Blood Moon Horn\" in their hands, he would have led the Knights to kill the rebels as soon as they launched, and they would not have let them grow bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no medicine for regret, but remedial work still needs to be done. To avoid the worst, Earl Pierce decided to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the blood-colored battle flag representing immortality caused an uproar among the noble coalition forces, and everyone knew that something serious had happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, there will be no retreat in this war. Either successfully wipe out the rebels, or be wiped out by the rebels, there is no third possibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles present will be treated the same. If they escape, not only will they die themselves, but they will also be chased and killed by the kingdom, and even their families will be implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these people on the battlefield are not the only ones who are unlucky. Nobles who did not arrive on the battlefield on time will be severely held accountable by the kingdom afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The astonishing turn of events made Hudson call \"Earl Pierce is crazy\" deep in his heart. He played stud as soon as he came up, which made him very speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a high-ranking earl, it is too reckless to directly risk his life like a market gambler.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't figure it out, so I can only accept it passively. Who made him just a new little knight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is quite satisfied with his current life. As long as you work a little harder, you can hope to become a fief noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the house, car, and tickets will all be available at once, and the girls will follow them to the door, and the rest of your life will just lie down and win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is absolutely necessary, he is not willing to give up his current identity, hide his name and start over in another place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Crimson Knights were still killing all directions, and the aristocratic coalition forces who realized that there was no way out suddenly broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the combat effectiveness of the serf army is poor, it has one advantage, that is, it is obedient. As long as the nobles take the lead in fighting ahead, they will follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it's because of blind obedience, maybe it's because of loyalty, or maybe it's because the concept of \"deserter\" doesn't exist in my mind at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the means of production are in the hands of the noble lords, and the whole family depends on the noble lord to survive. Even if they want to escape, where can they escape?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Atmosphere\" can affect people the most. When everyone around is struggling, no one can avoid being infected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson, the paddling knight, is commanding the army to launch a counterattack at this moment. Although he still didn't rush to the front line, he still made a contribution to this war after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time passed, more and more noble private troops arrived on the battlefield, and the balance of the war gradually began to tilt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the high platform, the old man in gray robe who watched the battle with cold eyes said indifferently: \"The nobles from the southeastern province are arriving one after another, it seems that there will be no left of the Crimson Knights today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the time, the limit is almost reached. Leave these cannon fodder and play slowly with the enemy, let our people withdraw first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the seemingly flat tone, it actually contained too much unwillingness of the old man. It was hard to lure the enemy out of the fortress, but because of his own lack of strength, he couldn't eat it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Compared with the aristocratic group that has ruled this land for a long time, the Skull and Bones is still too weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This gap is omnidirectional. It seems that they fought back and forth with the noble coalition forces on the battlefield, and it seemed that they were evenly divided, but the price paid was several times the casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the premise of the \"Blood Moon Horn\" bonus. Under normal circumstances, a mob of rebels would not be able to withstand a charge of the Crimson Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability to persist until now is entirely due to the blood moon horn controlling the nerves of the rebel soldiers, turning them into killing machines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But an evil weapon is an evil weapon after all, and there are conditions for turning a person into a killing machine. Not only do they need to be supplemented with drugs in advance, but they also have strong side effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly urging personal potential is doomed not to last. When it reaches the limit that a person's body can bear, it will collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including those who urge the blood moon horn, they also have to bear the backlash of the evil weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was a strong man just now, but after blowing the horn of the blood moon, he became a white-haired old man. If there was a further delay, there might only be a pile of bones left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be alive, but it is actually dead. A large amount of life force was swallowed up, and with the evil energy entering the body, the body couldn't resist it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the \"Blood Moon Horn\", but all the artifacts on the continent of Aslant need to pay a price for forcible driving, but the \"Blood Moon Horn\" is more fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were not so many restrictive conditions, the Blood Moon Cult unified the mainland three hundred years ago, and it would not be the turn of the Skeleton Society to take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the evacuation of the high-level Skull and Bones, the sound of the horn also disappeared on the battlefield. The originally bloodthirsty rebel soldiers collapsed on the battlefield one after another after regaining their clarity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The war is won!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no joy on the faces of the people, and everyone knew that this was just the beginning. Failing to keep the top level of the Skull and Bones, the rebels will eventually make a comeback one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After counting the casualties, Hudson's face was gloomy and terrifying. Although he has been wandering around the edge of the battlefield with his troops, he still suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forty-seven people were killed in battle, nine people were missing, 13 people were seriously injured, and 26 people were slightly injured.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the Koslow family is not bad. The coalition of nobles in the same industry, that is the real casualty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the alliance, how much the serf army lost is no longer important. The key is that the noble knights suffered heavy casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the bravest and fastest charging existence on the battlefield, he was naturally beaten by the most violent society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The members of the alliance meet again, and everyone has lost their image. The originally bright armor had already been stained red with blood, and every one of them exuded a permeating evil spirit from top to bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than half of the familiar faces are missing. This is Hudson's most intuitive feeling. Deep down in his heart, he couldn't help but secretly celebrate, luckily he was able to secure his hand. If he had followed the charge just now, he might have become a corpse on the battlefield now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sure enough, the reckless man died quickly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contempt is contempt, Hudson is still the same as everyone else. So many comrades-in-arms were killed all at once, if you don't show sadness, is that still a human being?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's search separately and help to collect the corpses. If there are retainers who survived, let them take them back; if not, arrange someone to send them a ride!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chelsea said in a depressed mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a heavy casualty, as the nominal leader of the alliance, it is naturally a lot of pressure. Thinking about Cheers, I felt depressed. As the boss, he didn't get any benefits, but troubles came to him first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people dead, an explanation must be given. If you don't take care of the affairs behind your allies, you can drown them with spittle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cleaning up the aftermath is not just about collecting the bones, but also winning the battle for the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these families have to change their heads and are unable to participate in the next territorial struggle, they must strive for one or two other resource compensations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the rules are followed, all adults know that the system is also implemented by people. If no one helps to fight for it, the so-called compensation is just a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others can hide, but Chelsea must stand out. Otherwise, how could he be convincing as the boss?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of the nobility is greater than the sky, and for the sake of his own reputation, Cheers can only bite the bullet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, everything has two sides. Although these problems are troublesome, if they are dealt with properly, Chelsea's reputation in the aristocratic circle will also greatly increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, including Hudson, nodded one after another, acquiescing to Chelsea's proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all in the aristocratic circle, and face is still important. After all, it's allies, and everyone is willing to contribute to such a trivial task as restraining the bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this help is limited to the noble himself. Ordinary soldiers who died in battle were ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to mainland practice, nobles who died in battle will be sent back for burial if their bodies can be sent back intact. As for ordinary soldiers, it depends on the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the casualties in today's war are so heavy, it is obvious that ordinary soldiers cannot be taken into account. There are corpses all over the mountains and plains, and a fire is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The true feelings just revealed were purely acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to say, we must speed up. Everyone lost a lot in this war, and they didn't get any supplies, so they could only make ideas from the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic family also has no surplus food, and it is doomed to lose blood in a battle, and it counts as much as it can get back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't count on money or anything. They are all a group of bitter people, how many coins can they have in their pockets. The key is to grab more weapons and equipment, these things are the most precious during wartime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone is poor, and only a small number of leaders in the rebel army have iron weapons, and even less armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the elite families of the allies who died in battle had good equipment, but unfortunately most of these weapons and equipment are engraved with marks. Unless the owner is also lying down, it's really not easy to take it privately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to give full play to everyone's subjective initiative, as soon as Hudson Chrysostom opens, whoever finds the weapon first will change it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for collecting the bones for allies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there is no need to worry at all, the corpse is lying on the ground and will not run away. After the battlefield is searched, it will be in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Searching for loot all the way, Hudson is also constantly reflecting. The daytime battle seemed to be a successful paddling, but his performance was not flawless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lone knight wandering around the edge of the battlefield is too conspicuous. Even if he reacted in time later and took remedial measures, it was hard to guarantee that no one would see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alternative, everywhere is the object of exclusion. It is difficult for an unconventional knight to mix in the noble circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the battlefield was too chaotic, and everyone didn't have the time to pay attention to him. Even if he was seen, it would be difficult to accurately identify him at such a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not impeccable after all. After all, there were not many knights who charged in the first wave, and it is a fact that Hudson did not follow the charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is immersed in the painful casualties, and they don't think so much, and they will definitely have doubts when they react later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson's blood still gives him a lot of points. Not following the charge does not mean not going into battle to kill the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Falling behind the team and not keeping up with the first wave of charge, the team behind was trapped in the siege of the enemy, and it was reasonable to not be able to rush through alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is in the same circle, and no one will talk nonsense about things without evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing \"can be done once, can be done twice, not repeated again and again\". It happened more often, and one day it would eventually go wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside what happened in the future, anyway, in this war, it is absolutely impossible to be discovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that comforts Hudson is: the Cavaliers are not always fighting on the battlefield, and they will also look for opportunities to rest when they are tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except, of course, a few brainless people, but these people usually don't live long. After all, human physical strength is not unlimited, and no one can withstand continuous high-intensity battles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind of killing people for several days in a row, confronting each other across the battlefield, just listen to the story. If it is true, these things on the ground are examples.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the setting sun, looking at the corpses all over the ground, Earl Pierce also wanted to cry without tears. It seems to have won, but the Bo Dalton family is a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention offending many small and medium nobles in the province, the family elite also lost hundreds of dollars, especially the scarlet knights who lost more than a hundred members. Paying such a high price, the record achieved is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the rebels suffered more casualties, cannon fodder is really worthless. If one batch dies, another batch can be drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the \"Blood Moon Horn\", the serf who just put down his **** is a threat. Whether it's ten for one or twenty for one, the Skull and Bones will be blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the next battle will be even more brutal, but something went wrong on the side of the counter-insurgency army. Judging from the reactions of the nobles, everyone is very dissatisfied with him as the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, after a battle is over, it is time to visit him as the coach first, but everyone ran to search for the spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to be angry, the autonomy of the fiefdom nobles has always been very high. If Pierce hadn't been the governor of the southeast province appointed by the kingdom, no one would have liked him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the Dalton family is the largest noble in the province, but other nobles are not easy to mess with. For a family with a little bit of background, who doesn't have the means to suppress the bottom of the box?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, everyone gave him face as the boss, but this time he was tricked, how could he not show it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pierce is very clear that things are not easy to handle today. If everyone can't give a satisfactory answer, the Dalton family will have a hard time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to invite the representatives of each family to enter the fortress to discuss matters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said in a low tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to bend and stretch is a noble character. It is not terrible to do something wrong, what is terrible is to make mistakes again and again. Being able to control the southeast province for a long time, Earl Pierce is obviously not someone to take it easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous two miscalculations were due to unequal information and miscalculation of the strength of all parties. The same mistake, Pierce will not make a third time, the reality does not allow him to make a third time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats pay attention to their appearance. Normally, if they accept invitations, they have to tidy up and dress up. This time is purely an exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dressed in military uniform, without even wiping off the blood on his face, Hudson stepped into the fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few nobles who were late and did not catch up with the battle, everyone was dressed in the same way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is expressing dissatisfaction with Earl Pierce with practical actions. Especially the members of the alliance who joined the battle first, they were full of anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of Earl Pierce's hesitation, everyone suffered heavy losses. If you don't give an explanation, this lawsuit will have to go to the king's capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the angry people do not include Hudson, and reason tells him that being angry can't solve any problems. Choosing to stand with everyone is purely for the sake of grouping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the cavalry lined up to greet them, Hudson knew that this was a deterrent by force and warned them not to make too much noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But such a trick has no effect on Hudson. Now he is looking forward to seeing through a group of cavalry, wishing to take it for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle during the day, this elite cavalry slaughtered all directions on the battlefield, leaving a very deep impression on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, this is the level that the regular army should have. The private army formed by a group of small and medium-sized nobles, except for a few guards, are all mobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already made a decision: If he has the opportunity in the future, he will also have such an elite cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

A group of nobles sat firmly on their horses, just staring at Earl Pierce, no one was willing to bow their heads first, and the scene was once embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to fight against the boss, which really opened Hudson's eyes. Obviously, the status of the nobles in this world is higher than he imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he holds the military and political power, and his family background is not good enough, Earl Pierce still has no choice but to rule a group of noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Governor, I am very sorry. Please forgive us for being unreasonable!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Viscount Oran who spoke. From his beating expression, it can be seen that there is no apology in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a nobleman who joined the battlefield halfway, Ilya Oran was not tricked, but this did not prevent him from fighting for his rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of small and medium-sized nobles, who are so united now, are essentially fighting for their own rights. As for seeking justice for the war dead, that was just a blatant rhetoric.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobles is cruel, and it is always strength that determines the distribution of benefits. In this game, the small and medium nobles and the big nobles are essentially unequal. If you want a share of the pie, you can only join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most miserable alliance in this war, it should be the most troublesome, but limited by its strength, it can only follow the flag and shout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from Cheers Knight's gloomy face that he is full of unwillingness. He wanted to speak several times, but in the end he chose to remain silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great knights are good, but that's only for minor nobles. The family's strength is not strong enough to dare to offend Earl Pierce to death, so they can only hand over the dominance to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, this is obviously not a good thing. The alliance failed to gain enough voice, which means that it will fall into a passive position next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that his arms can't twist his thighs, and all the allies are not in their heads, and he, a cute new knight, can't be eloquent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After staring at each other for a while, Earl Pierce jumped off the Flame Lion, and said indifferently: \"The evil weapon, the Blood Moon Horn, has appeared. How powerful is it? You have personally experienced it during the day.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"With the seal of the pope and the guardian of the Knights of Judgment, who can take away the Horn of the Blood Moon from under their noses?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this appalling news, Hudson almost fell off his horse. Now he is not Xiaobai who just crossed over, and he is also very familiar with the name of \"Blood Moon Horn\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the few parchment scrolls in my library, there is a volume dedicated to this stuff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred years ago, in order to quell the blood moon catastrophe, the Koslow family alone killed thirteen knights, and many family branches went into decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being sealed in the Papal State for three hundred years, he was able to come out to act as a demon, and what was even more unfortunate was that he caught up with him. Hudson was also speechless about this luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the companions around him, except for a few guys who didn't read much, who were waiting for the answer with a dazed expression, everyone else was sweating profusely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that he wasn't the only one making a fool of himself, Hudson was a little relieved. Even if the sky falls, the tall man will bear it first. The matter of the \"Blood Moon Horn\" is obviously not something that a little knight like him can control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that only skeletons will use evil weapons to make trouble, but how the \"Blood Moon Horn\" escaped from the Papal Kingdom and how it came to the southeastern province is the crux of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many things involved behind this, and it may trigger a new round of royal power VS religious power. Don't say that Hudson is so small and transparent, I am afraid that a big man like Earl Pierce is also walking on thin ice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I also hope this is fake, but you have also experienced the battle during the day. The sound of the horn sounds and the soldiers turn into killing machines. Isn't it similar to the legendary blood moon horn?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's answer completely extinguished everyone's illusions. Everyone knew that big trouble was coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the rebellion cannot be extinguished in time, the entire southeastern province and even the Alpha Kingdom may have to pay for it, and no one can think of being alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of continuing to find fault, everyone dismounted one after another and followed in the footsteps of Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to be awkward. When it comes to the \"Blood Moon Horn\", many things can only be said behind closed doors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he stepped into the hall, a young nobleman impatiently asked, \"Your Excellency, what does the church say?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How can it be so fast, I just sent someone to pass the news to the kingdom and the church respectively, and it will be next month at the earliest when the Papal State gives a reply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long-distance water cannot quench the near-thirst, and we can only solve the problem by ourselves in a short period of time, unless you are willing to lure wolves into the house. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pierce's answer made everyone's faces even more ugly. The church and the kingdom cannot be counted on for the time being, and there are not many choices left for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, they can also seek help from nobles in neighboring provinces, but the world of nobles is also divided into circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internally, everyone struggled with each other for resources; but externally, the nobles in the southeastern provinces were a whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a whole, but a political alliance. In the kingdom's political system, the aristocrats in the southeastern provinces are a group, and according to Hudson's understanding, they are township politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the central government, everyone is politically united to fight against noble groups in other provinces; at the local level, everyone is also self-contained, and they are the local emperors in their respective territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no free lunch in the world of the aristocrats, everyone pursues an exchange of equal value. If you open your mouth to ask for help from the nobles of the neighboring province, you will have to pay a big price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is absolutely necessary, everyone will not take this step. No one wants to see the neighbors reaching out to their own land to dictate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luring wolves into the house is of course not advisable. A mere Skull and Bones will not be able to take a step, and now the trouble is the Blood Moon Horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this problem is not solved, the enemy can continue to consume armed cannon fodder and us. Everyone has seen the battles during the day, how crazy the rebel soldiers controlled by the evil weapon are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We paid the price of dozens of nobles killed in battle, and none of the enemy's leaders were left behind. We just killed a group of worthless cannon fodder. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more you know the awe. Compared to ordinary minor nobles, he knew a lot more about the \"Blood Moon Horn\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't have to worry too much. The Blood Moon Horn is powerful, but it has been sealed for more than three hundred years. During this period, it has been continuously baptized by the Holy Light, and it is still affected after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was the Horn of the Blood Moon at its peak, the battle during the day would never be so easy. In the legend, it is even possible to transform a corpse into an undead to continue fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our speed is fast enough, and we don't give the enemy time to accumulate strength and feed evil weapons, the situation can still be salvaged...\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even trivial matters can take three to five months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After appeasing the hearts of the people, the nobles, including Hudson, were left in the hall for dinner. Only a few noble representatives left with Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for Chelsea who participated on behalf of the alliance, the rest are all powerful factions in the province, and the law of the jungle is fully reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson no longer has expectations for the results of the discussion. It can be seen from Chelsea's previous performance that he has no confidence to fight for reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, representation is better than none. At the very least, it can represent everyone and express the basic demands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is an aristocrat, and his appearance on the surface should not be too ugly. The influence of more than a hundred minor nobles in the alliance also needs to be taken into consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how discounted it is, there must be a share of military exploits. How to evaluate it depends on the pattern of several people in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want everyone to continue to work hard, you have to be fair and objective. This aspect should not be a big problem, the key is the next battle arrangement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to be reduced to cannon fodder, Hudson didn't care about eating, and directly turned into a hardworking bee, shuttling through the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is the time to test the soft power of the family. Holding the letter written by Baron Redman, Hudson kept visiting relatives and old friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this occasion is not suitable for exchanging feelings, it is still necessary to get acquainted. Maybe on the battlefield, relying on these contacts can save a life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that a thriving population is an advantage, let alone other things, at least there are enough relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson met three people of the same family who carried the banner of the Koslow family, one of whom was still playing under the command of Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other close and distant relatives, the number is even more. If you insist on clinging, it is estimated that one-third of the people present can count as your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these resources are also mutual. As long as there is no conflict of interest, everyone is willing to use this as an opportunity to make more connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, judging from the current situation, it might be necessary to set off tomorrow. Having seen how powerful the rebel army is, no one dares to take it lightly now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is always nothing wrong with making more connections. Even if it is temporarily hugging the Lord of Dawn's feet, it is better than not hugging at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning around in a circle, Hudson met almost all the nobles present. How much it can play depends on the development of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Overall, Hudson is still satisfied. No matter how dark the aristocratic group is secretly, everyone is still a gentleman on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is still very common in the aristocratic circle to sell favors as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not uncommon for people to avenge kindness and revenge, but that is only a very small number. Once it is exposed, it is tantamount to cutting itself off from the circle, and its decline is only a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the kindness shown on the surface must be repaid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for the results of the discussion to come out, he casually stuffed a few pieces of barbecue into his mouth, drank a glass of juice, and then left with the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not because everyone doesn't give face, it is really a heavy loss during the day, and now is the time when the morale of the army is in turmoil, and it is not suitable for the coach to leave for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as I stepped out of the fortress, a strong pungent smell hit my face, making people sick. Looking at the flickering flames in the distance, Hudson almost threw up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Burning corpses\" is also an inevitable part of the battlefield. It is estimated that no one knows how many people died in the daytime battle, and it is certain that this will not be a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not choose to burrow into the ground for peace, but burned on the spot. It is not that everyone has mastered scientific hygiene knowledge. The main reason is: in the extraordinary world, corpses can also be turned into murderous weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially if the enemy is a cult organization like Skull and Bones, if the opponent has a necromancer, these corpses are the biggest hidden danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it was an illusion, but Hudson vaguely heard screams, and there seemed to be figures shaking in the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that he was right, this was indeed burning a living person. As soon as anger rose from the bottom of his heart, it was quenched by reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I guessed correctly, the soldiers responsible for burning the corpses should have been careless, and treated the fainted rebel soldiers as dead bodies, and sent them to be burned without making up the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this situation, what else can Hudson say?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go over and say hello, let them repair the knives one by one before burning the corpse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to save people anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People polluted by evil weapons, even if they save their lives, will gradually lose themselves and slowly turn into killing machines. If you want to save people, unless there is a high-ranking priest to take action to purify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is indeed a high-ranking priest in the fortress, but he is too busy to treat the injured nobles. Even for the wounded of the Crimson Knights, only ordinary priests took action\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of the coalition army were seriously injured, and they could only rely on the help of their comrades to make up for the knife. Who cares about the rebels?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from lamenting the cruelty of the world, Hudson can do nothing. Even though there was a voice in his heart that kept telling him to change the world, reason still firmly prevailed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am precarious, and if I have the heart of a Virgin, I am afraid that I am not prepared to survive three episodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a master who is afraid of death, Hudson decisively chose to see out of sight and return to the camp as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the winning party, even if it is only a miserable victory, they must enjoy the fruits of victory. After counting the spoils, Hudson was disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't see any of the magic core and magic spar in the fantasy. Obviously, no one will bring these seemingly tall things that ordinary people can't use to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wealth income is not much, there are more than 100 gold coins, more than 800 silver coins, and a bunch of copper coins, but unfortunately they are not very valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there is no need for Hudson to pay pensions and military pay, otherwise this little money is estimated to be only enough to burn and bury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two dead horses, I don't know which ally's mounts they are, and they have been taken by the soldiers for extra meals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment have been harvested, but because the competition is too fierce, not many are picked up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thirteen pairs of armor, thirty-five machetes, twenty-eight giant axes, ninety-six spears, sixteen crossbows, five knight swords...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at this pitiful data, Hudson once suspected that God wanted him to learn from Nurhachi and carry forward the spirit of \"thirteen sets of armor to raise troops\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it, playing princes and generals in the continent of Aslante is kind of like, the rebel soldiers who were burned in the flames are an example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson, who was covering his nose, was still unable to fall asleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stimulation during the day is too great. From an ordinary person who can't even kill a chicken to a butcher on the battlefield, Hudson doesn't know how he got here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure of survival makes people metamorphose. If it hadn't really happened, Hudson wouldn't have known that he still had such a rational and ruthless side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, human potential is forced out. After experiencing the baptism of blood and fire, Hudson has become more mature and rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, just as a round of red clouds appeared in the sky, the trumpets of assembly sounded. The military orders on the battlefield were like mountains, and Hudson could only drag his tired body to assemble the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The condition of the soldiers is also not much better. It can be seen that yesterday's stimulation was too great, and everyone needs to take it easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that what they say doesn't count. The decision makers think that soldiers are precious and fast, so how can they care about the thoughts of soldiers at the bottom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, going out for an expedition doesn't mean you can just walk away. The coalition of nobles from all walks of life has gathered tens of thousands of mobs. If they don't arrange it well, they may mess up before they find the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This point, all the nobles have a deep understanding. After all, on the way here, everyone had frequent accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reorganization started without any accidents, and the family was still the basic unit. Although unscientific, it is very realistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 80% of the troops are mobs, and their own lords can't command freely. If they change officers, they don't have to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the prevailing military system in the mainland, a team of ten people, a battalion of a hundred people, a regiment of a thousand people, and an army of 10,000 people, regardless of whether it is reasonable or not, they are directly imposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The formations are all temporary, and there is no need for military pay. In this regard, Governor Pierce has been extraordinarily generous, forming five dissatisfied formations in one go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last night, there happened to be five people who participated in the discussion, and they became the commanders of the Five Armies respectively. If there is no inside story, Hudson can eat the knight sword.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, the strength of the five armies is not balanced. The first army led by Earl Pierce is a well-deserved elite, and the second army led by Viscount Oran is not bad, but the latter three armies are hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the lower the ranking, the worse the strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, the members of the original alliance were also independently reorganized into an army, with Cheers Knight as the army leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the heavy losses in the battle yesterday, this newly formed army was directly reduced to the bottom of the five armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the large number of soldiers under his command, and the credit he made on the battlefield yesterday, Hudson was honored to be appointed as the head of the Tenth Regiment of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the tenth regiment, which looks really miserable. In addition to Hudson's headquarters, 600 ownerless serf soldiers were assigned. Let this mob become more worthy of the name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even the 600 serf soldiers were considered troublesome by everyone, and no one liked it, so Hudson was cheaper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to this, the Tenth Regiment became the only fully formed regiment in the Fifth Army, and one of the few fully formed regiments in the entire noble coalition army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the other regiments of the Fifth Army, there are generally only four or five hundred people, and the Tenth Regiment, which has more than a thousand troops, can be regarded as a standout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, nominally to reorganize the entire army, and when it was finally implemented, they still respected the wishes of the noble lords themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, it should not be difficult for Hudson to find someone to form a team with the help of previous communication. But the bad thing is the position of \"regiment leader\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all mixed in the aristocratic circle. They may not have military talent, but political acumen is absolutely indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal people know that the higher the position in the army at this time, the greater the initiative they will gain in the next war, and the greater the advantage in future territorial battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves vital interests, and no one is willing to make concessions. The large number of dissatisfied regiments now are the result of everyone's compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slightly stronger families all chose to go it alone. Weak and weak families are forced to choose to unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of alliance is also a small group composed of three or five knights, and the number of participants is not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cause of this situation is still because of interests. There are too many allies in the alliance, even if they get the territory, it is not enough for everyone to share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the previous performance and the banner of the Koslow family, Hudson is also considered by everyone to be a team with the strength to eat alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are equal in strength must go it alone, and those who are not equal in strength, even if Hudson is willing to lower his figure to form an alliance, people do not believe that his promise can be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the relationship is, at this time, everyone has maintained enough rationality, and everything is based on interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have come to this point, and Hudson can't do anything. I can't explain to others: \"My main force didn't come here, and all they brought were cannon fodder. Don't worry about forming an alliance. After the war, your share will be indispensable.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that it is someone else, even Hudson himself doesn't believe it. Even if the main force didn't arrive, couldn't they come later?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Benefits move people's hearts. If it weren't for the lack of time, everyone would be eager to call friends and friends to strengthen their strength, so how could they hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that there are several knights in other people's teams, and dozens or hundreds of elite infantry, Hudson really has no confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this rotten world, he accidentally became the worst, and Hudson wanted to cry but had no tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to strengthen his strength, he had to fight for ownerless serf soldiers. To be precise, it can't be regarded as a struggle. As soon as Hudson put forward the request, he got the unanimous consent of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, everyone is really unable to command. The cannon fodder composed of their own serfs alone made them burnt out, and they really didn't want to ask for trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson's initial target was not the serf soldiers, but the remaining guards of the dead lords. It's a pity that these veterans were taken over by the legion commander Cheers Knight early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, it's not just Hudson who is the tenth regiment. The first regiment led by Cheers himself was also not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to personal strength, the dozens of soldiers under Chelsea's command are really powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even relying on his status as the head of the legion to occupy the dozens of veterans left behind by the unlucky allies, it didn't change much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in order to fill up the number of people, Cheers can only accept serf soldiers who have no owners. It's just that due to command considerations, his handwriting is much smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only received less than two hundred people, so that the first regiment became the regiment with the smallest number of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the tenth regiment at the bottom, Chelsea's first regiment would be the regiment with the worst combat effectiveness of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson suspected that Cheers pushed him to become the head of the tenth regiment to avoid embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Except for some criticisms caused by the military position, there was basically no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disputes over military positions are also easy to handle. Anyway, it is not a regular army, so there is no need to make it so serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, in order to balance the interests of all parties, in addition to the Fifth Army and the First Army, the other three armies still have a few more regiment numbers when they are not fully staffed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The First Army, that is the direct line of Earl Pierce. Even if the personnel are not directly under the standing army, they are still his vassals, and naturally no one dares to make trouble if the boss is suppressing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Fifth Army was simply frightened by yesterday's battle. Many families have suffered heavy losses, and they have no capital to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this were not the case, Hudson would not be the head of the Tenth Regiment. Even if it is just a count, there are more people who are more qualified than him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the aristocratic circle, it is also about seniority. In a sense, no one teamed up with him, and there were some reasons for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson had a prominent background, or a higher title, that's all. But he is a cute new knight who has not been canonized, and it is really embarrassing to be under the command of such a brat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others are unwilling to be a younger brother, and Hudson is even more unwilling to be a younger brother to others. Of course, no one would accept a younger brother over their own means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson knows that the soldiers in his hands are a mob, but it doesn't mean that other people also know. In the eyes of the outside world, the hundreds of direct descendants under his command still have some combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it makes me drunk. Other traversers pretend to be pigs and eat tigers, but when they come to him, they become tigers and scare pigs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the reorganization was completed, and it was too late to adapt, Earl Pierce impatiently gave the order—to set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of the overall situation, there is obviously nothing wrong with this decision. Knowing that Skull and Bones has the \"Blood Moon Horn\" in their hands, naturally they can no longer leave time for the enemy to prepare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to the specific implementation, there are frequent problems. The aristocratic coalition forces that have just completed the initial reorganization and have not yet adapted obviously do not have the ability to make expeditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this has little to do with Hudson. The task received by the Fifth Army is to deliver food and grass. Under normal circumstances, it is not their turn to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reactions of his colleagues, Hudson knew that this was a hard job. If you do a good job, that's what you should do; if something goes wrong, you still have to take responsibility; if the battle goes wrong, you may be blamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have never heard of a grain transportation team for military exploits. It doesn't make any sense to talk about the importance of escorting food and grass. The habit of counting military exploits in the continent of Aslante is to look at the battle results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transporting food and grass is something that anyone can do, anyway, everyone is not in the habit of robbing food and grass. At least in Hudson's memory, there is no historical record of who took the initiative to send troops to rob the grain road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ninety-nine out of ten wars are gentlemen's wars, everyone follows the rules very much, and few engage in foolishness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the rebels may be an exception. Without the shackles of the rules of the noble game, there are usually unexpected performances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the generals of the rebel army are all temporarily rushed to the shelves, and their military capabilities are usually not very good. Most of the time, there is no time to learn in actual combat, and they have already been suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, a few outstanding military talents emerged, and they were also crowned with titles such as \"despicable\" and \"shameless\", nailed to the pillar of historical shame, and despised by the world. The specific deeds are not recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Excellency, Legion Commander, this is really bullying! He even said it was taking care of us. According to this way of taking care of us, our previous sacrifices would be in vain...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron McNamee's words were just the beginning, and then all the leaders expressed their opinions, denouncing the unscrupulous decision of the Governor's Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Fifth Army made great contributions in the previous battles, it failed to leave the leader of the rebel army behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on this little credit alone, it is still shared by everyone. It is obviously not convincing to want to carve up unclaimed territories after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other nobles, the Fifth Army actually has a first-hand advantage. The most correct operation now is to continue to fight with the main force and continue to maintain this advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it doesn't play a decisive role in the next battle, just follow the soy sauce and claim credit, and you can still fight after the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task of escorting food and grass seems to be to take care of the Fifth Army, but in fact it excludes everyone from the carve-up feast. It is no wonder that the reaction of everyone is so fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waving his hands to stop the quarrel, Cheers sighed and said: \"I know these problems too, but now the Second, Third, and Fourth Armies are jealous of our military exploits and have united to exclude us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens to be among the five armies, and the strength of our fifth army is at the bottom. The drudgery of transporting food and grass naturally fell on us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But rest assured, I have already won the favor from the Governor. He made a promise that we would go to war after the supplies were delivered. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. He couldn't believe that Chelsea didn't see such a simple sowing of dissension.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the acquiescence of Earl Pierce, how can the Fifth Army be left on the bench simply by being excluded?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But knowing it is one thing, but this was originally a conspiracy. That Governor Pierce used the fief as a raft, which aroused everyone's greed and jealousy, and it was logical to divide the noble coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the head of the legion, who is fighting against everyone, has been secretly bought by Earl Pierce. After all, buying a person is far easier than buying a group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to understand. The general trend is like this, and it cannot be controlled by a small person like Hudson. The smartest thing to do now is to pretend to be confused and wait for the situation to develop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is to **** food and grass, the tenth regiment with the largest number of people is also cheaper than the other regiments. If you want to make a fuss, other people will make a fuss first, and he can hold back this anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, can you believe this kind of nonsense?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebels had already lost their troops under Fort Ethel. Even if the cannon fodder was worthless, it would take time to regroup.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Blood Moon Horn is powerful, there are also many restrictions on its use. What's more, the evil weapon has been sealed for more than three hundred years, and without 1.8 million souls as sacrifices, it cannot be recovered at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the speed of action is fast enough, the rebels simply will not have time to make a comeback. The team pulled up temporarily may not be able to withstand a charge of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones rats are all cowards. Once you feel something is wrong, you will immediately flee thousands of miles away, making it hard to guard against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Earl Pierce fulfills his promise, there must be enemies on the battlefield to kill us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Baron Brockett who opened his mouth to refute. From his eyes, Hudson saw unwillingness and anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I don't know where this confidence comes from. Hudson always feels that everyone around him has a honeyed confidence, as if countering rebellion is as simple as picking something out of a pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after reviewing Skull and Bones' record, Hudson has nothing to say. As a veteran cult organization in the Alpha Kingdom, it is completely commonplace to oppose Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically every few years, there will be a wave. Then, every time, they were fierce in the early stage and broke down in the late stage, and they just didn't make any achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost every old nobleman personally participated in suppressing the Skull and Bones rebellion. Facing a group of defeated generals, it is justified to be full of confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such old losers, no wonder Earl Pierce dared to let them do things before. If it weren't for the blood moon horn being involved, everyone would still be arguing now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reaction of the crowd, it is estimated that most people have doubts about the \"Blood Moon Horn\". Hudson is no exception. Apart from the initial shock, it is also suspected that Earl Pierce deliberately threw it out in order to divert the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the \"Blood Moon Horn\" is sealed in the Papal State, and guarded by the Knights of Judgment, so the rats from the Skull and Bones Society can steal it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was really stolen, the Papal State would not have no reaction at all, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If such a shocking scandal gets out, the church will not be able to keep it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside other things, tithes, do you still want to collect them? Do you want to sell indulgences?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reactions of the clergy in the southeastern province, we can see that the Holy See attaches great importance to the Horn of the Blood Moon. Just now when the news was received, and it was not even confirmed whether it was true or false, priests and temple guards rushed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that in the previous human civil wars, the Holy See was absolutely neutral. Even if a few priests are hired at a great price, they are only responsible for treating the injured nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the truth is, Hudson doesn't care. The joining of the church is definitely a good thing for the coalition forces, which means that everyone's life is more secure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it turns out that the news is false, it will be Earl Pierce to explain to the church, and the board cannot hit him, a little knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, arranging for the Fifth Army to deliver food and grass is not entirely about wearing small shoes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, someone has to be responsible for transporting the food. Among the five armies, the fifth army is the weakest, and overall, the fifth army is also the most suitable for this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did it take care of the overall situation, but it also divided the small and medium-sized nobles by the way. From the standpoint of Governor Pierce, this is simply killing two birds with one stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the constant swearing, Hudson chose to be a quiet listener. Although there is no credit for escorting grain and grass, it is better to be safe and secure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside other troops, his tenth regiment couldn't go to the battlefield anyway. Even if it is bad, the tenth regiment is also one of the worst regiments in the coalition army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the addition of 600 serf soldiers, the combat effectiveness of the army is still stagnant. He was not pulled back because the soldier saw blood once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To form combat effectiveness, one must either go through a period of running-in training; or be sent to the battlefield to be tempered in blood and fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was because Hudson was too carefree, or maybe he was humiliated by his subordinates. In order to divert his attention, Cheers asked, \"Hudson, what do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing \"how to see\", Hudson's heart collapsed. If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, he really wanted to reply \"sit and watch\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, things have already happened. Discussing these now is useless, we can't change the decision of the Governor's Mansion at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military order to **** food and grass has come down, all we can do is to earn as much military exploits as possible while transporting food and grass. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson was going to talk about gaining benefits, but he changed it to military exploits temporarily only when he saw that everyone looked bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since receiving the military order, Hudson has been thinking about how to maximize his interests. Letting him, a poor ghost, deliver food and grass, isn't this forcing people to go to Liangshan?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't scrape off a layer of oil, wouldn't it appear that he is not good enough?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, Hudson never expected that he would be able to lead a group of rabble on the battlefield and make great achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's easy to say, but how can it be so easy to obtain military merit?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he didn't hear the meaning behind the words, or if he was possessed by a master, Baron Brockett on the side directly attacked him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolling his eyes, Hudson decided not to be as knowledgeable as a reckless man, and replied with a smile: \"Uncle Brockett, the governor just ordered us to deliver food and grass, but there is no rule that we cannot go out to do side business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel army is now sitting in two counties, so they can't gather all the horses together, can they?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the rebel army is dragged by the front four armies, and the rear must be empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After completing the **** mission, it is not difficult for us to recover several small towns controlled by the rebels. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words brightened the eyes of the desperate crowd. Recovering a few small towns controlled by the rebels is certainly not a great military exploit, but is this a matter of military exploits?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recovering the lost land is second, and robbing the wealth in the hands of the rebels is the key. For the nobles, there are two purposes of going to the battlefield, \"military exploits\" and \"making a fortune\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that you don't have much hope for military exploits, you can only find ways to make a fortune. It can be said that in order to boost the morale of his allies, Hudson also broke his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, as the birthplace of the rebel army, was once a prosperous place full of traffic, but now only the autumn wind is bleak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conquering the world and governing the world are completely two concepts. Unfortunately, as a cult organization, Skull and Bones has no concept of governing the world at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the city lord's mansion, a group of top Skull and Bones leaders were glaring, and the atmosphere was terribly depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"High Priest, the soldiers and generals in Fort Ethel were lost, shouldn't you explain it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purple-robed middle-aged man on the left is the first to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Explanation, what kind of explanation do you want?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"you…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gray-robed old man's indifferent answer made the purple-robed man speechless with anger. The atmosphere in the room became more and more dignified, and a fight broke out just by looking at it, and the masked man sitting in the main seat suddenly interrupted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay! You are all middle-level and high-level executives, and you still want to make trouble like children. Is it plausible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, although Yiman's words are not pleasant, there is one thing that is true. The high priest really deserves an explanation for the Battle of Ethel Fortress. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the masked man speak, the arrogant gray robe instantly changed color, and he hurriedly explained: \"Holy Lord, I was too greedy in the battle of Fort Ethel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the nobles were used to intrigue and the reinforcements would not arrive on the same day, so they planned to attract the Crimson Knights, hoping to rely on the power of the sacred artifacts to wipe them out of the rest of the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, the enemy's reinforcements came so quickly, and we were caught off guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in this battle, we will not suffer. Although almost the entire army was wiped out, all the losses were cannon fodder. Use these cannon fodder to exchange for the enemy...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I believe the high priest made an unintentional mistake this time, but it's best not to make a similar mistake again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the nobles who have ruled this land for countless years, my Skull and Bones family background is too thin to withstand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone gathered together from all over the world, in order to overthrow the rule of the nobles, and stand under the sun from then on, without the need for future generations to live like mice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the chance. The enemy has given up the advantageous city, and wants to fight us in the wild. As long as we defeat this coalition of nobles, the southeast province will be ours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking over the southeast province will definitely shake the Alpha Kingdom, and people with lofty ideals who have suffered from nobles in the world for a long time will definitely respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the Alpha Kingdom, a wave of counterattacks across the entire continent was detonated, just like three hundred years ago, sweeping the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Victory will belong to us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Victory will be ours!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Victory will be ours!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if they had been injected with chicken blood, everyone shouted after the masked man. It can be seen that this is a recognition from the heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the instigation words of the mysterious \"Holy Master\" are logically nonsensical and unconvincing at all, but with the blessing of magic, everything is possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a cult organization that cannot be put on the stage. No matter how glamorous the packaging is in words, it cannot change its evil core.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After boosting morale, the skeleton will directly turn into a weapon of war and start to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first wave of devout believers all went to the battlefield as cannon fodder, and the ensuing conscription work naturally did not go smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a problem for Skull and Bones, if you don't want to join the army, you can catch the young men. Anyway, when entering the army, a bowl of \"courage potion\" is first poured in, and then some mental brainwashing is carried out, and brave and fearless soldiers are released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has two sides. This kind of artificially ripened \"warrior\" usually has a severe IQ drop, and the more bloodthirsty, the more brainless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you use it as a consumable, but it is impossible to train a real elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the chaotic team, Earl Pierce, who just yelled at Fang Qiu, had a gloomy and terrifying expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I knew that the coalition forces of nobles were good and bad, I didn't expect it to be so bad. It was only the first day of departure, and the serf soldiers below fell into chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As we all know, the speed of an army's march is determined not by the upper limit of the army, but by the lower limit of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the larger the number of soldiers and the more pig teammates in them, the slower the marching speed. On the contrary, a small force is more efficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the first day of departure, there was a farce where soldiers wandered around and couldn't find their homes. Seeing a group of noble lords looking around for his soldiers, Earl Pierce was very angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is so precious about the speed of soldiers, everything has become a joke at this moment. Not only did the first four armies fall into chaos, but the Fifth Army, which was escorting food and grass, even dragged its feet to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how far the troops in front ran, the Fifth Army only advanced more than 20 miles anyway. This is the result of Earl Pierce's constant urging, otherwise it will be even slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who fell at the end of the team, has the most say in this regard. It's really not him doing things, it's tens of thousands of troops marching, it's a long dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Optimistically estimate: Based on the calculation of four people in a row, with a distance of one meter between the front and the back, the queue of 20,000 troops will be as long as ten miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know exactly how many troops the coalition forces have. Anyway, more than three hours after receiving the military order to set off, his tenth regiment took the step forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the lack of livestock, the soldiers had to visit civilian husbands and push the grain trucks forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting the serf soldiers push the carts is a professional match, but the efficiency can't be expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a three-hour delay in front, and after deducting two or three hours of rest, burying pots and cooking, and setting up camp, the actual march was only five or six hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such circumstances, the Fifth Army has done its best to ensure that it can travel twenty miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no one can see this credit. The Earl Pierce, who was furious, ignored everyone's hard work and marched all day, and held a regiment-level enlarged military meeting overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surrounded by a bonfire, with the flickering light of the flames, Hudson could vaguely see Earl Pierce's gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the slow marching speed is mainly due to the drag of the Fifth Army. If it is not limited by the supplies, we can travel fifty miles a day.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Viscount Oran, the commander of the Second Army, who was bragging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were no serf soldiers, Hudson would not be surprised even if he traveled hundreds of miles a day. But with these guys dragging you down, traveling fifty miles a day is simply a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he hasn't tried it before. On the way here, he once challenged to travel 60 miles a day, so it's worth not mentioning the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only prove that the old ancestor's book of war makes sense-\"A hundred miles away will benefit the general, and fifty miles away will make the army halfway.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really force the troops to travel fifty miles a day, they will cry when they encounter rebels. Soldiers who are exhausted will tell them with practical actions what it means to be extremely bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it's not that our Fifth Army doesn't work hard, it's because the roads are too tortuous and there are not enough animals to pull carts, so we can only rely on manpower, and we can't get up as fast as we want!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, today is the first day of action, and our departure time is three hours late. To be able to travel twenty miles a day, everyone has worked very hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you still have spare capacity, I suggest distributing the baggage to each regiment to share the logistics and transportation pressure. I think the speed will increase a lot. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers Knight bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the Fifth Army cannot bear the blame for delaying the marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first four armies went into battle lightly, and the fifth army moved forward with heavy loads. Asking everyone to march at the same speed is clearly playing hooligans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Cheers, it seems that your military literacy needs to be improved! You can figure out the distribution of supplies, don't you know that the main force must ensure physical strength to meet the enemy at any time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Third Army Chief Chris taunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to shirk responsibility and blame the blame, but it is another thing to take over the drudgery of logistics and transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family knows their own affairs, and even normal marching can cause trouble. If the pressure of the luggage is increased, the scene is unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Cheers Knight was obviously not expected to fight with others, and soon fell into a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the officers of the Fifth Army, including Hudson, saw it and were anxious, but due to their status, no one had the opportunity to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the situation was one-sided, Earl Pierce suddenly reprimanded: \"Enough! I asked you to come here, not to quarrel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You also participated in the battle that day. The enemy has the blood moon horn, an evil weapon, and they can form an army as long as they pull out the cannon fodder, without training at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the number of enemies will increase by tens of thousands every day. You should know how terrifying a group of enemies who have no sanity and only know **** are. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way of balance is an essential homework for generals. Although Earl Pierce is not a famous general, he still has basic military qualities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting your subordinates fight, of course, can divide the small and medium nobles, but excessive internal friction will also damage their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the Fifth Army is easy to bully. But no matter how bullied and squeezed, the marching speed could not be increased, which was caused by objective conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, several unconvinced legion commanders were discouraged. The way the military and the political arena are played is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately shirk responsibility when encountering problems. That is typical political thinking, and military thinking is to solve problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the entire coalition, the most important thing now is to solve the problem of slow marching, not to shirk responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dispute was quickly quelled, and Hudson gave Earl Pierce a high look. I don't know how the military capabilities are, at least the political skills are still very mature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just a few days, he was able to divide, deter, and divert conflicts among the small and medium-sized nobles, and resolved the political crisis that the small and medium-sized nobles joined forces against him. The strength of his political skills can be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it is a time of war, and political skills alone are not enough. As long as there is a failure, the previously suppressed contradictions will explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't care what your reasons are, in short, you must arrive at Dadir City within three days and go straight to the lair of the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I sent out the Griffin Cavalry, and detected that the enemy is forcibly recruiting strong men. Both Wright and Wheaton are large counties, with a combined population of more than half a million. Even after one failure, the enemy can still pull out tens of thousands of young and strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones' style, you should all be aware of it. Desperately recruiting strong men, the actual number will definitely be more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to turn the two counties into white ground and face a steady stream of enemies, you must increase your marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is my minimum requirement to complete a three-day, one-hundred-mile march without affecting combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feel free to speak up if you have any ideas, if it works, I will not be stingy with rewards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's words made everyone's eyes shine. This was a promise made in front of everyone, if the reward was less, it would be slapping himself in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone was lost in thought, Hudson's focus was on the \"Griffon Cavalry\". This is the legendary air force unit, I didn't expect it to appear here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, judging from the usage situation, Earl Pierce should not have many under his command. Otherwise, they would not have been absent in the previous battle of Ethel Fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treasure arms, as rare as magicians, naturally cannot be used for consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A grown-up Griffon is a Tier 2 monster. It can beat three Hudsons even on the ground, and its fighting power in the sky is even more impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, there is only one Griffon cavalry regiment in the entire Alpha Kingdom, and it is still not full, and the number is slightly more than that of the mage regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the result of hundreds of years of accumulation in the kingdom. At the beginning, the royal family only obtained two pairs of griffins, and it took two hundred years of reproduction to reach its current scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the midway war must be exhausted. Anyway, the fertility rate of this thing is definitely not much higher, unlike porcupines that have several litters a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attention is attention, unless you sell yourself and go to the past, otherwise a mount of this level must not have Hudson's share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then split up. Our four armies will go forward with seven days of dry food, and let the fifth army come slowly behind.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clearly knowing that this was Earl Pierce's plan, but for the sake of profit, he had to jump into it, so he was naturally upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if you get rid of the luggage. There is still a lot of uncertainty for the four armies to arrive at the front line on time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the rebels are not fools, so they have been waiting for them to fight over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones, which has no aristocratic baggage, has always used everything to achieve its goals. For them, they don't know what the bottom line is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who was about to offer some advice, finally chose to shut up. Although credit is important, let him jump out and grab Viscount Oran, forget it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military meeting ended quickly, and everyone was satisfied except for the righteous indignation of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles, you have to find a way to vent your grievances. If everyone is deprived of the opportunity to make money, they can only make up for it by making a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking away from the main force undoubtedly gave everyone a space to move freely. With the joint efforts of all the nobles, the robbery plan was quickly released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that when it comes to specific implementation, I encountered a little bit of trouble. After all, the Fifth Army still bears the heavy responsibility of escorting food and grass, and the progress must be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several regiments stared at each other with big eyes and small eyes, looking at Cheers Knight, waiting for the \"boss\" to arrange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Military orders are like a mountain, and the task of transporting food and grass must be completed. Therefore, we must leave a large force to **** food and grass, and we can only dispatch a small group of elites to recover the lost ground for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This requires a nobleman who is highly respected, smart and capable, and brave enough to stay and preside over the overall situation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Cheers looked at everyone expectantly, hoping that someone would take the initiative to sign up. It's a pity that everyone is very humble, and everyone is waiting for others to take the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it's not okay to be humble. It is clear that this is to take the elite out to rob, leaving the serf soldiers to continue to transport food and grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A team of more than 4,000 people, without the support of basic officers, how can it be so easy to command?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson is scared at the moment. It's hard to keep track of the food and grass completely escorted by a mob. What if there is a rebel attack?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, everyone, no matter who stays to preside over the overall situation, the spoils will not be lost.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with everyone else, he, the knight who is about to go bankrupt, is obviously more enthusiastic about wealth. Unfortunately, no one is still buying it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Cavaliers of Hudson are good at running the army and have the talents of commanders. Besides, he also proposed this matter. I think the Cavaliers of Hudson will stay and preside over the overall situation!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elder Baron Mechel suggested with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

During the day, he was still an uncle and nephew, so he sold him so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoever proposes the plan is responsible for its implementation. If it succeeds, the credit belongs to everyone; if it fails, the responsibility rests solely with the proposer.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a simple workplace law, I didn't expect that after time travel, I would still be tricked. Hudson wanted to cry but had no tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, he is already very careful, isn't it just to make a small fortune, as for making it so big?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** plan was proposed by him. Obviously, he only hinted at it, and never mentioned the word \"robbery\" at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the process of formulating the specific plan, Hudson made a choice based on too many words, and he just echoed from the beginning to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wanted to be a quiet melon-eating crowd, but I didn't expect that I would end up eating melons on my own head. As soon as Machel's old man raised it, everyone responded in a crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The beautiful words made Hudson feel ashamed. As a cute new knight, he surpassed the rising star and was directly upgraded to \"highly respected\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can only capitalize on such a shameless operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wearing a high hat, no matter how humble Hudson is, he can't stop a group of nobles from pushing hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It really made Hudson realize what is: \"A tree is as beautiful as a forest, but the wind will destroy it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The root of everything is that the previous performance is too good. Even though Hudson has tried his best to hide his clumsiness, he still stands out against the backdrop of a group of pig teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pretending to be a tiger and scaring pigs\" was so successful that everyone mistakenly thought that \"Hudson ordered troops, the more the better.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, everyone would not dare to entrust this \"heavy task\" to him. After all, if there is a problem with food and grass, everyone will suffer together when the board is hit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson is willing to take the blame, his small body can't afford it. Even if he borrowed a human head, it would be unlucky for Knight Cheers. Who made him the head of the legion?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every word makes money, Hudson can only passively take over the important task. Originally, I wanted to bring some unlucky people to accompany me, but I finally gave up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the main force of the rebel army robs food, the entire Fifth Army will be enough to add up, and leaving a few unlucky knights will not help, so we simply don't want to pull hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking over the command of all the serf soldiers, Hudson is also under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the continent of Aslant is strictly hierarchical, and the thorns have been cleaned up by the nobles long ago, and no one jumped out to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After democratically electing a bunch of centurions through voluntary elections, Hudson appointed his own cronies as centurions, barely establishing a command system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the earthworm-like team below, Hudson took a deep breath and reminded himself secretly: This is not his own soldier, so he doesn't need to be so demanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"From now on, the whole army must act in unison. Even if it is eating, sleeping, and shitting, it must be collectively acted at the specified time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eyes are brightened, and everyone supervises each other. If someone breaks the rules and no one reports it, they will be caught again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one person breaks the rules, the whole team will starve; if one team breaks the rules, the whole battalion will starve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under my command, you must abide by my rules. Don't take it seriously, anyone who violates the military order will be hanged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you can't catch it, anyway, there are family members who can take the blame. If you don't want to implicate your wife and children, then be honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I followed the team closely. If you are missing and can't see the body, it will be considered a deserter by default. The whole family, young and old, went to the entrance of the village to hang on the gallows...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded in plain language. It can be summed up in three words - continuous sitting system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to say that one person violated the military order and the whole team was killed, but he just remembered that this was a mob. He was afraid that no one would be killed in the end, so Hudson could only change it to \"starve\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the bottom serfs, starvation is also a heavy punishment. Before enlisting in the army, it was estimated that he would not be able to eat a few full meals throughout the year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is now Earl Pierce who is in charge of the food, so that they can eat with their stomachs open. After finally eating a few full meals, naturally no one wants to continue to starve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this way of transporting grain is not scientific. All of them passed in a wave of studs. If the war lasted too long, they would have to run back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it, but Hudson didn't talk much. As a petty officer, it is right to obey orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, this is just counterinsurgency, not a national war. It is easy to make jokes about the continuation of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if there is a war between kingdoms in the Aslante continent, the usual war time will not last very long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple, the war is too costly. In the feudal era with backward productive forces, no one could bear to go to war for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the strong pressure of the \"continuous sitting system\", after slaughtering a few unlucky ones who violated the military order, the food transportation team finally stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the battlefield, it is uncertain whether it can be relied on; anyway, it is engaged in logistics to transport food, and finally no one continues to get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, one of the reasons is also very important, that is, everyone's food standards have improved. Not only is the black bread enough, but you can also get a bowl of salty meat broth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this bowl of salty minced meat soup, Hudson's image in the minds of the serf soldiers changed from a vicious nobleman to a \"generous\" nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, the extra salt and meat broth is the quota for the nobles of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson wanted to swallow it himself, but the business travel disappeared along the way, and there was no place to sell the stolen goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grain and grass are all bulk commodities, and there is nowhere to hide them. Bringing the embezzled food and grass to join the main force, Hudson is not so naive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He despised those short-sighted businessmen for not knowing how to grasp such a good opportunity to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get rid of dirty items, you can't even talk about the lack of supplies. In the face of cruel reality, Hudson can only be an upright soldier. He simply gave a wave of generosity to his allies and increased the food treatment of the soldiers under his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After self-reflection, Hudson attributed the failure of corruption to the lack of extensive connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that businessmen seek profits, but their fists are not strong enough, and they are often scammed by unscrupulous nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the Fifth Army was in charge of transporting grain and grass, no one dared to do business. The biggest reason was that the Fifth Army had too many nobles, and they couldn't handle it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If any link is not done, it may be blacked out by others. This kind of shady deal, even if it was robbed, would not dare to say it to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risks and benefits are not proportional, so naturally no one came. After all, who would have thought that the nobles of the Fifth Army could play tricks and go out to rob together, leaving Hudson alone to look after the house?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dream of getting rich was shattered, Hudson could only drift away some disposable ordnance such as arrows, to make up for the pain in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After recovering a large town, Cheers Knight was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too clean, not to mention gold and silver treasures, even the granary was set on fire by the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't reacted quickly enough to **** a batch of unburned food from the fire in time, their work would be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the rebels had been prepared for a long time, knowing that Luoye could not hold it, so they transferred their supplies in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the townspeople who were kneeling to greet him, Cheers was forced to put out his thoughts of robbery. There is no way, the group of people in front of them are old and young, and it is really hard to get rid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that this group of people in front of them is too poor, and there is really no way to squeeze out oil and water. Even if it is pulled out to sell slaves, it is a commodity that no one cares about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, the rebels are obviously well prepared, what should we do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Mechel asked bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking such a big risk to rob, they harvested a pile of food, making it seem like everyone was short of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a barren land in the northwest. As the lords and nobles of the southeast province of the \"kingdom granary\", who doesn't have a few warehouses to store grain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, even if there is no harvest for two or three years, no one will suffer from famine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine at other times, but this time they took the risk and sneaked out to rob. Taking this pile of food on the road, there is still a lot of mobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frowning, Cheers said with a gloomy face: \"There is so much food, I definitely can't take it away. For the sake of the Lord of Dawn, I simply do a good thing and leave it to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only five days before the battle of Ethel Fortress. Even if the rebels are prepared, it is impossible to transfer all the supplies to the lair so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to the next stop, if there is no gain, then chase in the direction of Dadir City. Even if there is no harvest, they can go there in time to join the grain transportation team. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without much hesitation, everyone agreed. Come here, you can't make a trip in vain. If you don't grab something and go back, everyone's thoughts will not be clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief rest, the Fifth Army was on the road again. It can be said to be \"come in a hurry, and go in a hurry. With a wave of your sleeve, you will not take a piece of bread.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the aristocrats and lords leaving, the uninhibited citizens suddenly regained their spirits and joined the grain grabbing team one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An old man who was very hungry grabbed a handful of roasted rye and stuffed it into his mouth, and immediately began to foam at the mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning, the people who ate these foods fell to the ground one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is poison in the food!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps luck was running out. As soon as Hudson ordered to set up camp and bury pots for cooking, he saw Griffin cavalry hovering low above the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that the Fifth Army's outing to rob is now gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, even though he tried his best to help cover, he still showed his feet in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to buy enough time for the allies to rob, and for the safety of the food transport team, Hudson deliberately suppressed the marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    March every morning and set up camp at noon. Half of the time in the afternoon is for queue training, and half of the time is for ideological work. It is safe and full all day long, and there is no time for everyone to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has calculated that according to the current speed of traveling 20 miles a day, it will only take six days to reach Dadil City, which just guarantees the supply of food and grass for the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all hello, hello, hello everyone. Unexpectedly, Earl Pierce's head was convulsed, and he suddenly sent knights to urge the Fifth Army to speed up the march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the legion is not there, so there is no need to say that Hudson can only receive him. Although he made up an excuse that he thought was perfect, he met a nobleman along the way who everyone knew was abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the Griffon cavalry in front of him is the result of the knight who went back to make a small report yesterday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a height of less than ten meters, even the worst archer can shoot him with an arrow. After hesitating for a while, Hudson finally put out the idea of ​​killing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too difficult to keep secrets in front of so many people. The rebels didn't have any Griffon cavalry, so no one would believe it if they said it was an accidental injury!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For nobles, deception is just a basic operation. Even if things go wrong, it is the responsibility of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The law does not blame the public, even if Earl Pierce wanted to enforce the military law, he couldn't proceed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the fact that several legion commanders had a very tense fight for their own interests. If Earl Pierce wanted to attack the nobles of the Fifth Army, they would immediately turn their guns around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobility, there are only pros and cons, there is no right or wrong. The small and medium nobles are attached to the big nobles, and at the same time join forces to fight against the big nobles. This is not only a kind of political balance, but also the way for everyone to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This point also applies when looking up. The great nobles are attached to the kingdom, and at the same time join forces to fight against the king, which is also a kind of political balance of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, the kingdoms of the Aslant continent are like companies, and the nobles and kings inside are all shareholders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is limited to the amount of equity, in essence, everyone is the owner of the company. For the sake of profit, it is necessary to argue, to argue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Major shareholders have more shares and have more power to speak, but the combined shares of small and medium shareholders far exceed those of major shareholders, which is enough to negate the resolutions of major shareholders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a certain gap in status between everyone, but in essence they still have the right to dialogue on an equal footing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the king cannot execute a nobleman for no reason. Even if a noble committed a felony, it must be confirmed by the noble council before they can be executed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are the bright side. No one can guarantee what is going on behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, violating military orders on the battlefield can be directly executed. In actual operation, you will find that it is not the same thing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't make mistakes of principle, and you don't fail in life, a large group of relatives, friends and old friends will come forward to intercede.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially these group violations of military orders, as long as they do not lead to disastrous consequences, they will eventually be reduced to minor events.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to violating military orders, the consequences of killing Earl Pierce's Griffin cavalry were more serious. The former is a public matter, but the latter involves personal grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the Griffon Cavalry leave, Hudson has already begun to figure out the aftermath. It was obviously too late to notify the allies to come back, not to mention that he didn't know the specific goal of the robbery army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighing helplessly, Hudson finally decided to lie flat. Whatever he likes, there is nothing he can do now anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Earl Pierce pursues the responsibility, it has little to do with him. At most, they will not report the knowledge, which is completely unworthy of mentioning compared with violating military orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other people, they can only ask for their own blessings. We are all adults, and we should be prepared to be exposed from the moment we make the decision to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If they were not allowed to rob, what would they get back?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you lose money once or twice. If you lose blood ten times or eight times, no matter how big your family is, you will be tossed and bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Earl Pierce's view, as long as the food and grass can be delivered on time, everything else is a minor problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conceptual generation gap cannot be reversed in a short while, even if Hudson has worked hard to integrate into this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after all, he only came to this world for a few months, which is really insignificant compared to the decades in his previous life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behavior can be changed, but thinking will still be affected. This is an advantage, but also a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly a question of the circle. After time travel, the people who come into contact with are the little nobles, and the objects that Hudson imitates and learns from are also the little nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to understand the thoughts of big shots without standing at a certain height.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"James, send someone to notify the Fifth Army and order them to speed up their march. By the way, let them know, I already know the matter, let them figure it out for themselves!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pierce said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to care about it. The rebels are more cunning than expected, and they have laid many traps along the way, making the coalition army miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Griffon cavalry scouting, who discovered the enemy's conspiracy in advance, they might suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of immoral enemies, arriving in Dadir City within three days is obviously an impossible task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who was pulled up from his sleep, was speechless when he saw Earl Pierce's military order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warning him is useless, who knows where the robbery army went?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to find someone, sending griffin cavalry to scout in the sky is far more efficient than slowly finding someone on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But doing this kind of shady thing, it is estimated that his group of unreliable allies also covered it up. Even the Griffin Cavalry, if you don't observe closely, it may be difficult to find them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Xiludi, I am also looking for the legion commander and the others, but there is no clue at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the officers of the Fifth Army are missing. You see, this chaotic team may collapse at any time. How can we speed up the marching speed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why don't you go back and talk to the Earl, let him send a hundred knights to serve as officers, and the marching speed will immediately increase. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with an aggrieved face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't know, don't know, still don't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified nobleman, how can he betray his companions?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is no torture to extract a confession, Hudson is the most strict-mouthed ally. No one should ever learn from him that the Fifth Army went out to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Earl Pierce has discovered it, Hudson will pretend to be confused to the end. If he dares to pursue responsibility, he will show it badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current grain transportation brigade is a mess, and the frontline battle is imminent. Hudson does not believe that Earl Pierce can really mobilize hundreds of knights to clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no successor, we can only let him, the \"papier\", do the work first. No matter how slow the marching speed is, it still keeps the logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the team is changed rashly, the team will collapse, and this expedition will have to return without success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight of Hudson, are you threatening the Earl?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the meaning behind the words, the knight Xiludi asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No! Knight Xiludi, I'm just explaining a fact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many officers of the Fifth Army were missing, so I was left to clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can go to the army to see, the camp is full of serf soldiers, not a single qualified soldier can be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am now commanding a group of serfs who have just laid down their hoes, not an army. It is too harsh to ask them by the standards of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure that I can travel twenty miles a day, I have tried my best. If you want to speed up, you can only ask His Excellency the Earl to send military officers over to clean up military discipline. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to quibble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to speed up the march and betray your allies, but you must add money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without sufficient interests, he would not be a traitor. It's just that these are obviously not up to Knight Xiludi to decide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will truthfully report today's matter to His Excellency the Earl. I hope the Hudson Knights will not regret it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Xiludi said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that his anger didn't last long, and was appeased by a small box full of gold coins. A smile finally appeared on his originally cloudy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be saying, wouldn't it be fine if this happened earlier, is it worth acting like this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Knight Xi Ludi said slowly: \"The matter of the Fifth Army is too big, and His Excellency the Earl is very angry. But it is their fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson Knight, you are able to stand up and turn the tide in a difficult situation. I believe His Excellency the Earl will be very happy to know. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the goal has been achieved, Hudson endured the pain and said: \"This still needs the support of the knight Xi Ludi. After this is done, the Koslow family will definitely thank you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he can only represent himself now, it does not prevent Hudson from writing a blank check. As for how to fulfill the promise afterwards, we will be optimistic about it later. Who made his portion not enough?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two official characters, the same thing is said from different mouths, and the nature is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is familiar with history and is very aware of the consequences of offending the messenger. Even if there is the capital to show bad, who is willing to really show bad unless it is a last resort?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show respect to Earl Pierce, Hudson decided to increase the marching mileage by 0.5 miles starting tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No more, no more money, no motivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of the knights of Xi Ludi, before dawn, Hudson ordered the soldiers to get up and light a fire to cook, proving that he tried his best with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the gesture of caring people, the soldiers performed directly in their true colors. The chaotic scene was as lively as a vegetable market, and the knights of Xiludi who watched it had nothing to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading such a team to transport food and grass, not to collapse is a talent. It is really not easy to guarantee twenty miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson again, Knight Xi Ludi's eyes have become much more eager. Different from the previous pure interest transaction, now I really want to make friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rule N of Nobility's Survival Rules: Make friends with capable people to make yourself better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lang is affectionate, concubine is interested, the two hit it off, and soon rose from strangers to uncle-nephew relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson was also drunk. It seems that from the time of his expedition to the present, he has added a double-digit number of uncles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Compared with the previous communication, the price paid in this wave is really too high, and the pockets are all shriveled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he still has ideas about the territory, then he will inevitably continue to throw money. There are not only the flames of war flying on the battlefield, but also the sophistication of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have the strength to get fame immediately, then you must do a good job in human relations. Having these relationships may not necessarily lead to success, but without these relationships, there is a high probability that bad things will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea of ​​\"making money\" came to Hudson's mind again. One plan after another came out, but none of them worked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking stock, Hudson found helplessly: Robbery is the most suitable way to make a fortune right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the food transportation team that was slowly moving forward, Hudson had to temporarily put down this idea. Now that we meet the rebels, it doesn't matter who grabs who?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking on the horse path, Hudson's expression suddenly changed. The flying bird in front of him hangs and doesn't fall. If he still can't find the problem, his military book will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for the slightest hesitation, Hudson directly ordered: \"Stop advancing, set up camp on the spot, and strictly prevent the enemy from attacking.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to run. Hudson doesn't think he can run past the rebels because he is dragged down by food and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving these materials and running away, not only will his aristocratic status be compromised, but the Fifth Army will also be tricked by him to vomit blood. It is estimated that these people can hunt and kill him all over the mainland for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't want to live in exile so early, felt that it was necessary to continue struggling. After calming down, Hudson's hanging heart also fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are Griffin cavalry in the coalition army. If there are a large number of rebels sneaking in, it is impossible to escape the eyes of the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serf soldiers are useless, but there are more than 4,000 people in the end. As long as you don't fall into the enemy's ambush, you will not hesitate to face a small group of rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't believe that the Skull and Bones, hiding in XZ, can train elites like the Crimson Knights in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Training troops is also a technical task. In the continent of Aslant, where knowledge is strictly blocked, these things are passed on from father to son by word of mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Skull and Bones Club can recruit talents in this area, it cannot be too powerful. After all, Skull and Bones usually cannot provide them with practical exercises, and just a few theories cannot make everyone successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the time when the Skull and Bones first rebelled, the training time left for them is at most two or three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In such a short period of time, it is almost impossible to build an elite team from scratch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made this an extraordinary world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well trained ordinary people are, they are not truly elite. Like the famous Crimson Knights, even the most ordinary soldiers are also advanced fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is in the same rank, and the gap is only fifty steps or a hundred steps. Hudson thinks it is still possible to challenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"High Priest, captured two enemy spies.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the report from his subordinates, the old man in gray robe was so angry that his face turned livid. As the ambush party, jumping out to catch the enemy's spies, isn't it the initiative to expose the whereabouts?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being angry has no meaning, and there are very few people in Skull and Bones who are as \"intelligent and courageous\" as him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This ambush was actually a temporary idea. If he hadn't received the news that the main force of the fifth army was coming together, he wouldn't have come out to ambush with two thousand \"elites\" who had been trained for less than two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it turns out, these people are really hard to make. Mingming repeatedly ordered not to stand out, but the enemy sent two spies to lure him out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unaware of the accident, he even ran to \"take credit\" carelessly. If it weren't for the occasion of employing people, he really wanted to slap this unsightly guy to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the intact spy, the old man in gray robe breathed a sigh of relief. He was able to become a prisoner without any damage, obviously he didn't resist much, and he knew at a glance that he was not a strong-willed person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Very well, I have recorded your achievements, and will reward them together after the battle. Put people here, and you can go down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rick, distribute the potion of courage and tell the soldiers. Wait until I order it, then take it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the gray-robed old man's eyes suddenly glowed green.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at each other, the two spies who were still in a state of bewilderment, as if they had lost their souls, knelt down to the old man with dull eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Owner!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this title, the old man in gray robe smiled slightly, and asked amiably, \"What's your name?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"George!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Geddy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the leader of the rebel army who originally wanted to say a few more words of credit broke out in a cold sweat. With a trembling salute, he hurriedly turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he finally understood why his colleagues in the meeting were afraid of the \"kind-looking\" high priest in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as this weird method is concerned, no normal person will be afraid of seeing it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, everything in the jungle is normal. Just now there were two wild deer fighting, and our brothers have already cleaned them up. This is the spoil, just dedicated to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pointing to the two wild deer lying on the ground, Gedi introduced happily. It's a pity that this kind of suffocating excuse obviously can't fool Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two wild deer fighting, can make the birds hang and not fall? It is estimated that only those who have not received military education may believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to make up a reason, at least make up a Warcraft fight. But if it was really a monster, the two people in front of them would not be able to return intact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The possibility of buying is not very high. The two people in front of him were randomly assigned by Hudson. It happened to meet two traitors. This luck is too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, buying serfs to be traitors, such a non-intelligent thing, can't be done by normal people without drinking seven or eight bottles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging by the expressions of the two of them, it doesn't look like they are lying. With a flash of inspiration, Hudson instantly understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to control two people in such a short period of time can only be explained by extraordinary power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't know what the enemy was using. Anyway, his reason told him not to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, put the things here, you two go down and rest first! After the leader has eaten, the troops will continue to set off.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the two of them leave, a sneer appeared on the corner of Hudson's mouth, and he thought to himself: Sure enough, he was controlled. Serious soldier, who doesn't know the rules of his regiment commander Hudson, how can he continue on his way after setting up camp?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to wait, just wait slowly. Better to put it off until tomorrow and see who survives who.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the wild deer on the ground, Hudson shook his head helplessly. Although venison is delicious, he dare not eat something of unknown origin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Extraordinary World has a lot of ways to assassinate people. Who knows what happened to the two wild deer sent by the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hungry and highly nervous in ambush for most of the day, it turned out that the enemy just couldn't come through the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the soldier whose face was flushed from holding back, the old man in gray robe wanted to cry but had no tears. He had clearly received the signal just now, so he asked the soldiers to take the potion of courage, but the enemy just couldn't come over after waiting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to get rid of the water, and now the effect of the medicine has begun to take effect. If the enemy doesn't come again, the effect of the medicine will pass after a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could the potion that forcibly increases the soldiers' desire to fight have no sequelae?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the body is, after being stimulated by such madness, it will take a while to slump.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the effect of the medicine wears off and the soldiers enter a period of weakness, and the enemy kills them again, it will be the end of the calf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to attack by force, this is a question worth thinking about. Although he habitually ridiculed the incompetence of nobles, but as an old loser, how can he not be afraid in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the birth of the Skull and Bones, in the two hundred years of glorious history, the best tactics have always been crowd tactics. Winning the many with the few, and defeating the strong with the weak, that only exists in legends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing 2,000 \"elites\" to forcibly storm the noble coalition camp with more than 4,000 people is a high-risk thing no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"High Priest, the enemy has not come for a long time, will they be exposed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the middle-aged man made the old man in gray robe look down. Then he shook his head again: \"No! I can feel that they are alive and well, if they are exposed, they will never be intact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should be that the enemy commander's life is too extravagant and corrupt, and he doesn't want to hurry when he is full. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, the old man in gray robe became very depressed. He never dreamed that the extravagant life of the nobles could be the reason for the failure of the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"High Priest, the drug's effect time has passed halfway, since the ambush failed, let's attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have prepared hellfire. As long as we can rush in and burn the enemy's food and grass, we will win this war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged man persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally discovering the enemy's grain transportation team, it was a great loss to just give up in vain, so it's better to simply take a gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gray-robed old man is a ruthless man. The tens of thousands of troops in Fort Ethel before can be decisively abandoned, let alone the \"two thousand\" elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A strong attack is not done by a wise man. Make the appearance of retreating, deliberately revealing flaws, and lure the opponent to attack.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the eyes of everyone adoring, the rebels withdrew from the woods, and appeared carelessly in sight of the grain transportation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp, Hudson, who received news of the rebels' presence, immediately appeared on the observation deck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the rebel army full of flaws everywhere, Hudson was sure that if he had an elite team in his hands, he would definitely seize the opportunity and take the exploits that came to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for now, looking at the nervous soldiers, he decisively gave up this tempting idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities are reserved for those with strength. As for this group of mobs under his command, if they fight out, God knows what will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tie the traitors Gedi and George to the gate of the camp, and the whole army begins to prepare for battle. The archers and spear throwers are arranged in five rows, and the attack will be launched as soon as I give the order.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, his heart softened a bit, and he didn't directly cut off the heads of these two unlucky people. Just for the safety of the camp, they still had to be kept under their noses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the enemy move slowly, Hudson was a little dumbfounded. He actually wants to play \"lure the enemy\", how much does he think highly of him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sticking to the camp, I feel very nervous. Take the initiative to attack, without drinking seven or eight bottles, absolutely dare not think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking about it, Hudson decided to add some more material to the opponent. Immediately ordered: \"Close the gate of the camp, and blow the charge horn!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two are not contradictory. If the regular army is so tossed, they are worried about hurting their morale. But the fifth army in the camp now doesn't need to worry about this at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't Hudson who was trying to destroy his own prestige. Among the soldiers under his command, there were only a handful of soldiers who could distinguish the meaning of the horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order is all relying on shouting, and all other methods are useless. If it wasn't for decoration, the trumpeters would not be equipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An embarrassing scene appeared, the charge horn sounded, not only the soldiers of their own camp were confused, but also the enemy army on the opposite side was also confused. They were all serfs who had just put down their hoes, and no one had better knowledge than the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine for the soldiers to be confused, but the key is that the officer on the opposite side also looked confused, and he just didn't respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was dumbfounded. Don't wait for such a playful person, judging the sound of the horn is the most basic military common sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the rebels just don't have common sense. Originally, I wanted to use the sound of the charging horn to scare the enemy, but in the end, a realistic version of playing the piano against the cow was staged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is certain that if the army rushes out now, it will surely catch the enemy by surprise and gain a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson still decided to follow his heart. As a pacifist, forget about fighting and killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the rebels leave, no one came out to pursue them. The grey-robed old man who watched from hiding in the woods had a gloomy and terrifying face, and his prediction failed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from the decision to ambush the food delivery team, this is already his third consecutive misjudgment, which completely does not match his status as a wise man of the Skull and Bones Society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way out, if you are unlucky, you will meet an opponent at the level of a \"gou\" king, let him use all kinds of schemes, and he will not move like a mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order, and the whole army storms the enemy camp. Rick, after the outbreak of the war, you lead people to sneak in from the flanks, and use hellfire to burn as much as possible of the enemy's food and grass.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man in gray robe said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to procrastinate any longer, otherwise the potion expires and the backlash breaks out, and it will be over. He didn't think that the enemy would give up the opportunity to add insult to injury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than losing eight hundred \"elites\" for nothing, it's better to take a gamble. Gritting his teeth, the old man in gray robe picked up the mage's staff and walked out of the woods with a few trusted guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to act personally is also a last resort. Being able to become the high priest of the Skull and Bones Society depends on unparalleled resourcefulness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the Ethel Fortress was completely annihilated, it aroused criticism in the meeting, but it was suppressed by its previous prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything can be one and not two. If he fails for the second time, the short-sighted reckless people in the meeting will definitely take the opportunity to attack him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cult organizations have never been easy to mix. The cruelty of the internal struggle is far beyond the imagination of ordinary people. In Skull and Bones, the loser has no right to live.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Come on!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the effect of the potion of courage, the rebel soldiers showed a super-moving and fearless spirit, shouting slogans and charging towards the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson was also under a lot of pressure at first, but when he saw the enemy directly charging so stupidly, his hanging heart fell again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The first group of archers is ready, let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice fell to the ground, and more than a hundred arrows flew out unevenly. The few rebel soldiers who rushed to the front were instantly shot into hedgehogs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was secretly delighted. It is worthwhile for him to gather the hunters of the whole army. Although they can't be uniform, at least their accuracy is good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The second group of archers is ready, let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The third group of archers is ready, let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rain of arrows all over the sky could not stop the momentum of the rebels' charge. Under the trend of courage potion, everyone exploded with super potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the corpses all over the floor, the old man in gray robe couldn't bear to look any longer. He came here to rob food and grass, not to give away heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's camp gates were not even touched, and hundreds of casualties were paid. There were not many soldiers and horses brought out this time, and if they were sent in this way, they would have to be cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Great Lord of Skeletons, your most loyal servant, hereby offer a sacrifice to welcome your coming.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time as the spell was uttered, the five girls who were pushed forward for bloodletting began to transform in pain, and their flesh and blood gradually blurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weird scene made Hudson, who was directing the battle, break out in a cold sweat, and his intuition told him that he should stop it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the old man was a mile away from him, and there were rebels in between, so there was nothing he could do to stop the ceremony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really think highly of him. The means that were not used in the battle of Ethel Fortress that day were actually used on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that the more critical the moment is, the less he can panic. In order to cheer himself up, Hudson said to himself secretly: \"Maybe this evil method is not so powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really invincible and can reverse the outcome of a war, it will be used in the battle of Ethel Fortress that day, why wait until now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time passed by, and the five girls had turned into five resentful skeletons. A smile gradually appeared on the cold face of the old man in gray robe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While chanting the spell continuously, he signaled his subordinates to pour a pile of medicine on the skeleton. Under the action of the mysterious power, the potion and the skeleton fused together, and the white bone began to change color, emitting a silver-white light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, five skeletons jumped up, grabbed the people around them and devoured their souls directly. Seeing this scene, the grey-robed old man's face changed drastically, he hurriedly shook the staff in his hand, and reprimanded sharply: \"Bold!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am the servant of the Skeleton Lord. I summoned you to collect the sacrifices for the master, so go quickly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if they were afraid of something, the five skeletons who originally wanted to attack the old man showed fear. After a little hesitation, he immediately shifted his target and followed the execution of the battle to the Hudson camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where they passed along the way, the rebel soldiers who blocked the way were reduced to food for the skeleton monsters. Seeing all this, the serf soldiers were frightened and their legs trembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the skeleton monster approaching, Hudson reprimanded sharply: \"What are you doing in a daze? Why don't you let me perform my duties!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom took someone to get the fire oil, and other oil juice was also prepared. I will burn these broken bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spear throwers are ready, aim at these five monsters, and listen to our command! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the \"Silver Rank Skeleton\" is powerful, it is not invincible. In terms of combat power, it is slightly stronger than the great human knights, and far inferior to the silver knights of the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To Hudson's grain transportation team, these five silver skulls were a threat, but if they were thrown in the battle of Fort Ethel that day, they would be cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flame has a restraining effect on undead creatures. It is estimated that Earl Pierce, who is riding a flaming lion, can deal with these five silver skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the church is the most professional in dealing with undead creatures. If there is a priest to cooperate, it will definitely get twice the result with half the effort to deal with this thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The first group of spear throwers, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Hudson's order, more than a hundred disposable spears went straight towards the five silver skulls, only to hear a crackling sound, the spears were either shot down or cut off, and only a few spearheads completed their mission .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If other creatures were pierced by spears, they would definitely be seriously injured, but for these skeletons, it was not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Second group of spear throwers, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The third group of spear throwers, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Group after group of spears flew out, and Hudson was secretly glad that he had secured his hand and did not use these weapons to deal with the rebels in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, we can only go up to melee now. After all, ordinary bows and arrows pose almost no threat to these monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no magician, unable to directly attack the soul fire of skeleton monsters, so they can only use stupid methods to smash their bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After five consecutive rounds of throwing, the skeleton monsters had already reached the gate of the camp, and none of the horse-repelling posts and pits arranged could stop their steps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attack just now achieved a record of breaking several ribs of the skeleton monsters, leaving several marks on their bodies by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Pikemen launched the first round of attack, the giant axemen attacked in the second round, the Broadsword team attacked in the third round, and the Warhammer team attacked in the fourth round...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson arranged it in an orderly manner. It's just that while giving the order, he couldn't help moving his body backwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is just a new little knight. It is still very challenging for him to pick up a sword and chop skulls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the tactics of the sea of ​​people, or the strong pressure of the supervising team led by Master Hudson, the coalition forces finally blocked the five skeleton monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Casualties, don't mention it! Anyway, the data is very touching. If it weren't for Hudson's continuous sitting system, and the deserter was sacrificed to the flag in time, it is estimated that he would have been defeated by the skeleton monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the main reason for being able to stabilize the formation is that the five skeleton monsters are not very intelligent. I only know about the constant killing, and I didn't chase after Hudson, the commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the coalition forces did not fall into chaos, but instead organized resistance, the grey-robed old man not far away turned paler.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For these five skeletons, he paid a considerable price. However, judging from the current battle situation, it did not develop as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the skeleton monster is killing all directions, but there are more and more broken bones on the skeleton monster. Two of the skeletons were even missing arms and legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The gate of the camp has been broken open, pass the order, and the whole army will follow the skeleton messenger to attack! Don't leave any breathing space for the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was issued, but no one acted. At this moment, the gray-robed old man realized that his guards were also easily killed by the five skeleton monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was because of the indiscriminate killing of the skeleton monsters that the rebel soldiers deliberately took a detour. Even though the skeleton monster rushed in, everyone couldn't keep up in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

From time to time, I heard a heart-piercing roar, which was the fear from the depths of my soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was stimulated, or maybe it was dying, the skeleton monster burned by the flames became more and more crazy, forcing the coalition soldiers to retreat steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hold on to me, these monsters are about to die.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson worked hard to mobilize the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he knew that the skeleton monster was the craziest at this time, fighting him at the front was dancing with his life, but Hudson had no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One will succeed and ten thousand bones will die. Those who are generals are the most jealous and soft-hearted, and at times like this, it is even more important to remain rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected of a silver-ranked skeleton, the kerosene was burned out, and the skeleton was still alive and kicking, but a few more bones on its body were broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the fire just now had an effect. Without any hesitation, Hudson ordered again: \"Splash water!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the sound of \"呵呵呵\" sounded, and countless cracks instantly appeared on the originally solid skeleton frame. Seeing this scene, the morale of the originally panicked soldiers was instantly boosted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldier with the sledgehammer rushed to the front and dealt a burst of output to the skeleton monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were still a lot of casualties, Hudson felt that it was all worthwhile looking at the bones and scum all over the floor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A skeleton monster was shattered, and the soul fire without the protection of the bones flew out, flying around the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who hadn't reacted yet, directly collided with the fire of the soul, and the mysterious compass lurking in his body suddenly moved, and then there was no more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all energy. Magic crystals and magic cores can be the food of the compass. It seems that there is nothing unacceptable to eat some skeleton monster's soul fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the remaining four skeletons were no longer hateful enemies in Hudson's eyes, but energy packs delivered to their door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reaction of the compass, the effect of swallowing a group of silver skull's soul fire is better than swallowing more than a dozen magic crystals before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident. After persisting for a while, the four skeletal monsters who were seriously injured finally turned into food for the mysterious compass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the threat of the skeleton monster, Hudson's hanging heart was mostly relieved, even though the enemy had already rushed into the camp at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Retreat to the third line of defense, and the archers are responsible for covering!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking through two lines of defense in one fell swoop can be described as a complete victory. The gray-clothed old man in the rebel camp was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five skeletons who had high hopes were defeated too quickly. Although the preliminary plan was completed, the results achieved were not satisfactory to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that hundreds of ordinary soldiers of the enemy were taken away, but dozens of their own people died at the hands of the skeleton monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that tearing down the enemy's camp gate would allow them to drive straight in. I didn't expect that the opponent was too \"doggy\". After breaking through the camp, there would be a second line of defense, a third line of defense...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although each line of defense is not considered strong, just a few rows of wooden horse-repelling posts + fences, it is still a threat to the charging soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment they are blocked by obstacles, the enemy's archers have already moved. Clearing the roadblocks can only be carried out under the rain of arrows. With the crude equipment of the rebels, every step forward, someone will fall down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite food-burning team with high hopes was originally supposed to sneak in secretly, but was forced to rush to the front line and became the Death Squad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic situation was unbearable to look at directly, and in an instant, more than half of them were lost under the rain of arrows. Apart from cursing his subordinates for their incompetence, the old man in gray robe found that he couldn't do anything now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Summon the skeleton again, just think about it. How can there be no price for casting such a heaven-defying sorcery?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the old man in gray robe has not changed much, but in fact it is quite the opposite. If it weren't for the protection of the Skeleton Lord, his soul would have been swallowed by the undead world long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the effect of the medicine was about to end, the old man in gray robe stamped his feet anxiously. The more flustered you are, the easier it is to make wrong decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the command of the gray-robed old man, countless rebel soldiers launched round after round of desperate attacks. Hudson, who commanded the battle, was shocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have seen people who are desperate, but I have never seen such desperate people. If there are tens of thousands of rebels, there is no problem with directly taking human lives to pile up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now it is obvious that there are more defenders. According to this desperate style of play, what if the entire defense line is torn apart?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After looking at the battlefield, it was preliminarily determined that the casualties of the rebels had exceeded 20%. If it were a normal army, it would have already collapsed by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect of the potion of courage paralyzed the nerves of the rebel soldiers, making them bloodthirsty and warlike, but the companions around them kept falling, which also hurt their nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fear began to spread in the minds of the rebel soldiers, but the hindsight caused by nerve paralysis made them still fight instinctively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the observation deck, Hudson picked up the bow and arrow, and locked the target on the old man in gray robe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sharp arrow shot out like a flash of lightning, but unfortunately a soldier in front suddenly rushed over, just in time to block the arrow for the old man in gray robe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thrilling scene made the old man in gray die instantly. As a mage, he is not good at hand-to-hand combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, the gray-robed old man decisively chose to retreat. His intuition told him that if he didn't run away quickly, he was going to see the Skeleton Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the battlefield in remembrance, the gray-robed old man was ruthless, and fled directly into the woods, disappearing from Hudson's sight in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to do his best, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but extremely happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrow just now was just to scare the rebel commander, but he didn't expect to be able to take away a rebel soldier 150 meters away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extra long play?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my mind, this thought just flashed across, and immediately took out another sharp arrow and shot it at a rebel leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sound of \"whoosh\", a rebel leader who was a hundred meters away was hit by an arrow and fell down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within one hundred and fifty meters, anyone who is targeted by him will die. Such a precise hit rate made Hudson suspect that he had become a marksman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although he didn't know exactly what was going on, his intuition told Hudson that it was related to the fire that the compass devoured the soul before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, his archery skills could only be said to be beginners. With the strength of a knight's arm, he can draw a strong bow to its full capacity. The hit rate is limited to within 50 meters, and any further is a fight for character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now with keen perception, it is easy to lock on to the target. It's a pity that although the bow and arrow in his hand are of good quality, they are only ordinary goods. If it was replaced by the special bow and arrow of the elves, the commander of the rebel army would definitely not be able to escape today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who got on his head, directly turned on the burst mode. If you see something that is not pleasing to the eye, you will shoot an arrow directly, and dozens of people will die in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The live-action version of the chicken eating mode, but the rifle is replaced by a bow and arrow. However, this does not affect the game experience at all. This kind of wandering on the edge of life and death is even more exciting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One quiver was exhausted, and Hudson, who had calmed down, immediately ordered the guards around him: \"Call with me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The rebellious coach is dead, surrender quickly if you don't want to die!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The rebellious coach is dead, surrender quickly if you don't want to die!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First dozens of people, then hundreds of people, and finally thousands of coalition soldiers shouted. The deafening shouts made the rebel soldiers confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't listen to the nonsense of the enemy, how could the high priest...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rebel leader could finish his sentence, he was hit by an arrow that Hudson snatched from the archer, and he died immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning. Any rebel leader who jumps out to stabilize the army will receive special care from Hudson's bow and arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is within the range of the shooting range, it is almost always a one-hit kill. As a price, two of the strong bows in Hudson's hands were scrapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one was in charge of the overall situation, and the rebel soldiers who were disturbed stopped their progress one after another, looking for the figure of the \"High Priest\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this moment, there is no sign of the gray-robed old man. Not only is the head coach gone, even the leader of the rebel army who is in charge of the rebel army is now dead and injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, many psychologically fragile rebel soldiers collapsed on the spot. Facts have proved that the potion of courage is not a panacea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prelude to the collapse kicked off. Except for a few diehards, most of the rebel soldiers lost their desire to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cautious Hudson did not rush to order the whole army to attack, but quietly waited for the rebel soldiers to make a decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle has progressed to this point, it doesn't matter whether they surrender or not, as long as the medicine expires, everything will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, the group of rebel soldiers in front of him was similar to people who smoked opium. At the beginning, the spirit was high and the combat power skyrocketed, but once the effect of the medicine wore off, it became sluggish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the method used by skeletons to control rebel soldiers is more powerful than opium, but in the end it is not on the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the limited combat power and many restrictions, it was just some sequelae. It is estimated that the aristocratic group with more resources would have started to follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't keep Hudson waiting long, deserters began to appear in the rebel camp, one, two, three, four... soon triggered a crowd effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the rebel soldiers throwing down their weapons and fleeing around, Hudson, who was about to order the pursuit, finally relented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all hard-working people, so why kill them all? The most important thing is that they have thrown away the most valuable weapons, and they will not be able to find any loot if they catch up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the supplies in the camp, these spoils of war are his legal income, and they can be taken on the road in a fair manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commanding other people's private army to fight, gain military exploits and spoils for yourself, and the original owner will still pay for the casualties and losses caused. I feel comfortable thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules of the game are like this. In the continent of Aslante, serf soldiers have no human rights, and the military achievements they made belong to the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the sole commander of this battle, Hudson is naturally entitled to exclusive military exploits. As for the colleagues of the Fifth Army, let's first explain to the coalition headquarters why they left the luggage and ran out to rob!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    jumped out to compete for military merits, if they left their elites to **** food and grass, and now they want a share of the pie, then it is barely justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, all of them took their elites out to rob, and all those left were serf soldiers. Under this background, even if they could pull their faces off, no one would approve of it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the battle report, Hudson has already thought about it. Winning this war preserved the food and grass of the noble coalition forces, mainly: the wise command of the Hudson Cavaliers and the **** battle of the Koslow family's private army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other serf soldiers who participated in the war, they were purely making up the number, and they could just pass it off without wasting parchment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order goes on, the supervising team is responsible for collecting the wounded and guarding; the first to ten hundred teams are responsible for cleaning the battlefield and collecting spoils; the eleventh to twenty-three hundred teams are responsible for collecting firewood; the twenty-fourth...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most urgent task is to clean up the battlefield as soon as possible, and burn the corpses on the ground by the way, so as not to leave an opportunity for the enemy to take advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Silver skeletons have appeared. Who knows if the escaped rebel mages will turn back and use the corpses on the ground to cause a natural disaster of the undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a possibility. If the undead disaster was so easy to handle, the continent of Aslante would have long been dominated by necromancers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, the mysterious necromancer is actually similar to the ordinary magician, nothing more than an extra skill for summoning undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, undead creatures can be summoned infinitely, provided that the mental power is strong enough to suppress the undead creatures they summon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This suppression is not the suppression of a single undead creature, but the total mental power of the undead creature summoned by the residence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the critical point is exceeded, it will be backlashed by undead creatures. A large part of the reason why necromancers are rare is caused by the backlash of undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the summoned undead creatures can devour the flesh and blood of living beings and improve their spirits. Once the spiritual power of the undead creatures exceeds that of the necromancer, they can break free from the shackles of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a moral undead creature, in order to repay the kindness summoned by the necromancer, it is natural to take him with him forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, believers who are affiliated with a big figure in the undead world are much safer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one's own mental strength is not enough, one can also pretend to be a tiger, and use specific rituals or spells to borrow the power of the master behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, across a world, the power that can be borrowed is also very limited. Otherwise, what I encountered just now was not five silver skeletons, but a sea of ​​skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson, who thought he was hard-hearted, couldn't help but feel sad secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the daytime battle was a complete victory, the price to be paid was also very heavy. There were two hundred new wounded, and more than seven hundred people died with the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besieging the five silver skeletons alone killed more than 300 people. If Hudson hadn't reacted fast enough to make full use of his knowledge of physics, the loss would have been even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to have won the victory, but the grain transportation team is actually seriously injured. If the number of rebels and defenders is equal, it is really hard to say the outcome of this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not impossible to defeat the rebels, but mainly because it still shoulders the heavy responsibility of transporting food and grass. Compared with winning or losing on the battlefield, successfully transporting food and grass to the destination is the core of this mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no heavy burden, Hudson is still sure if he plays rookie pecking with the rebels on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stems from the \"superior\" command ability of the rebels. Originally, I thought that the noble knight's stupid charge was already stupid enough, but I didn't expect that the rebel commander's command ability was half a catty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the commander of the rebel army has no bottom line and principles, and can do everything, his military literacy is really hard to show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, the aristocratic ruling group's knowledge blockade and \"values\" guidance to the people at the bottom are all successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the rebel organization has existed for countless years, under the hoodwink of the concept of \"strength first\", the training of military talents is still neglected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priests are good priests, but they have to be smart enough to command the army to fight. Relying on secret techniques and potions, it's okay to bully the same ignorant low-level nobles, but when encountering opponents with slightly stronger military capabilities, they will instantly reveal their true colors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, it is completely correct strategically to come out to rob food and grass this time. But when it comes to the implementation of tactics, it's a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient preparation in advance, lack of sufficient military common sense, so that the plan was exposed early. The ambush that was supposed to take the initiative turned into a passive attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had a vague insight into the essence of the world, Hudson had already begun to mourn for Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention tossing and turning in a huge pit, I was also limp by being fooled, and I still fantasized about making a comeback as a whole, it was simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson has never understood what the skeleton would want?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What you do is a rebellious business. Not to mention the lofty things like political programs, at least you must have the support of an interest group, or represent the interests of a group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the so-called Skull and Bones, they regard nobles as enemies, serfs as worthless, and merchants as blood bags... It can be said that they have offended all groups since the beginning of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling them rebels is a compliment. An organization that opposes all normal people, Skull and Bones' cult name is well deserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with real losses, the record is much more random. Hudson didn't even bother to make statistics on the specific record. According to the situation on the battlefield, he could make a rough estimate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Four thousand elite rebels were defeated, 2,570 rebels were wiped out, 81 rebel leaders were killed, five silver skull-level undead were eliminated, and various strategic materials were seized.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, there are still Griffin cavalry watching in the sky? The record is too exaggerated, it is really easy to cheat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is impossible not to exaggerate the achievements. The credit for countering the rebellion is at the bottom of all the military achievements in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy's strength is not exaggerated and the military exploits are not falsely reported, who knows that this war will not be easy, and who remembers the contribution of his Hudson Cavaliers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance his persuasiveness, Hudson emphasized the importance of preserving food and supplies with strong pen and ink, directly raising this small-scale war to a strategic level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is uncertain how much it can play. Anyway, taking advantage of the opportunity of reporting war damage, Hudson legally lost a lot of supplies in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He couldn't eat the lost supplies, and most of them had to be taken out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False ones can't be true after all. If someone is more serious, Hudson's battle report is full of loopholes. If the above relationship is not cleared up, the enlarged version of the military exploits cannot be realized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this feat, coupled with the previous Battle of Fort Ethel, when the spoils were divided after the war, Hudson would probably be able to get a piece of territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the size and quality of the territory, the Koslow family's network of contacts in the southeastern province will be tested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have come to this point, it is no longer Hudson's short-term management that can work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All he can do is to manage the relationship between all parties. He doesn't expect everyone to help, as long as they don't make trouble, it will be fine in the end. In the end, it is inevitable to fight for the strength of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coalition Command, Earl Pierce, who had just defeated a sneak attack by the rebels, was like riding a roller coaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones will not play their cards according to the routine, not only carry out sneak attacks on the marching road, but even send troops to sneak attack the grain transportation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, that little guy named Hudson still has some skills and shattered the rebels' sneak attack plan. Otherwise, he can only bring a large army and return home in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, his resentment against the Fifth Army suddenly rose again. He didn't **** the grain and grass well, and went to rob him privately, so he didn't take him seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Angry is angry, now he really has nothing to do with these daring guys. Since leaving the main force, these guys have disappeared from his sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area of ​​the two counties is not small. If a small army of hundreds of people wants to hide, even the Griffin cavalry will not be so easy to find.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the number of griffin cavalry is limited, and the movement of the rebels must be monitored first, so there is no time to find them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can be contacted, and accountability is naturally out of the question. If you want to settle accounts, you have to wait for someone to come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was the Fifth Army acting as though it were doing its part, but even the nobles under his nose were also not very peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Griffin cavalry in charge of the investigation reported to him more than once that someone had left the main force to engage in private work. Perhaps it was because he was under his nose that he restrained himself a little, and always went and returned quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the fact that everyone has not made any troubles, for the sake of the overall situation, Earl Pierce also turned a blind eye and closed one eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action was taken, but the account was still kept in his heart.

Once anything involves the church, no kingdom dares to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha is not bad, it has enough autonomy, the power of the church is not strong here, and it is still unable to influence the country's decision-making.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are still paying tithes to the church, the aristocratic group has always been obedient and obedient. The \"tithe tax\", which should be the most important income of the church, is only enough to maintain the daily expenses of the church here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fear that the church would not be able to sustain the evacuation, it is estimated that it could have gone too far. The people below dare to do this, naturally they cannot do without the support from above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood moon catastrophe three hundred years ago was not only a game between the ruling class and the rebels, but also a battle between royal power and divine power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Empire of Light supported by the church fell apart in the game. As the top ten legions supported by the church's force, none survived after the war, and the church, which suffered heavy losses, was forced to shrink strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning, the church still has a strong local influence. The struggle between secular kingship and theocracy continued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the efforts of several generations of kings, through various means such as infiltration and division, bribery and suppression, they successfully separated the relationship between the local church organization and the Papal State, and the Alpha Kingdom successfully locked the power of the church in a cage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the church organization of the Alpha Kingdom is nominally under the command of the Pope, but in fact it has already been secretly controlled by the great nobles from all sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The archbishop of the kingdom is a member of the royal family, and the bishops everywhere are all descendants of great nobles. Whether it is personnel training or internal promotion, it has formed its own system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone chooses to execute the orders of the Pope. If it harms one's own interests, it is a piece of toilet paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the relationship between the Alpha Kingdom and the Papal State is naturally not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no direct conflict, because the law does not blame the public. Now the slightly powerful kingdoms on the mainland all play like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countries that haven't finished restricting theocracy are also working hard in this direction, making the pope dare not act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, everyone is now under the command of the Lord of Dawn. If it is urgent, people will directly start a new stove and dump a bunch of large and small Holy Sees, then there will be no fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lord of Dawn has not been manifested for thousands of years, and everyone's awe of the gods has long been reduced to the lowest. If it weren't for everyone's need for the church to fool the people at the bottom, it is unknown whether the Holy See can still exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of causes must bear fruit. Whoever made the Holy See have too much fun in the past would send people to the stake at every turn. Even the king would not feel safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Alpha Kingdom is much more harmonious. Although the king and the noble group are still fighting among themselves, there has never been any incident of sending nobles to the stake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all a family. Even if the power struggle fails, the big deal is to go home early to take care of the elderly, and it is rare for them to be exterminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The blood moon horn appeared in the southeast province, and our good old pope doesn't seem to be so kind on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he shouldn't start with my Alpha Kingdom, I really thought it was three hundred years ago, and everyone had to support them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strength is always the greatest confidence. After getting rid of the exploitation and oppression of the church, the strength of all countries in the mainland has undergone earth-shaking changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the royal family suffered heavy losses in the orc war a hundred years ago, showing a bit of decadence, and somewhat unable to suppress the great nobles in the country, thanks to the efforts of Caesar III, the kingdom still maintains a political balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of dealing with the church, the position of the aristocratic group is the same. After all, no one wants to have an ancestor with a penny on his head, especially if this ancestor can send himself to the stake at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in the last hundred years, the Holy See has been working hard to change its external image, almost no longer sending nobles to the stake, but it still cannot be recognized by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is expected. After three hundred years of recuperation, the strength of the Holy See has recovered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not as good as the peak period, it also surpasses any human country on the mainland. Now that their development has reached the limit, it is not surprising that they will target outside the Quecnine Peninsula.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the blood moon horn in the southeast province is probably a temptation for us. If Earl Pierce can cut off their extended tentacles in time, it is estimated that the Papal State will change its target again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, similar things happened in the Frankish Kingdom, the Dante Kingdom, and the South Coast Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persimmons are too soft to pick. If the Holy See wants to regain its former glory, the first step it takes must be successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking an opponent is a test of skill. If the influence is too small, not only will it not be able to form a deterrent, but it may trigger a joint boycott by various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention those who are strong, if they are taught to be human, it will be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See is not monolithic, not everyone likes to toss, and most cardinals want to maintain the status quo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who want to toss are mainly the Knights of the Judgment, the Inquisition, the Temple, the Gate of Heaven... these notorious organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the corner of the Blood Moon fell into the hands of the Skull and Bones this time, and it was one of them. After all, it has not been a day or two since they manipulated cult organizations to wreak havoc on the mainland. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Military Affairs Grand Duke Efiero calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The organization that suppressed the most severe heresy finally became the supporter of the heresy. I have to say that this is a kind of irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, if there is no heresy, how can it reflect the greatness of the Holy See?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of strategic contraction of the Holy See, only the endless emergence of heresies and cults in troubled places can highlight the importance of the church.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that in recent years, the growing aristocratic group has continuously competed with them for business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heresies that were supposed to be suppressed by them were killed by the nobles first, and they were not given a chance to perform at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that in the minds of many common people, there are only churches left for prayer and pastors who can only make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
