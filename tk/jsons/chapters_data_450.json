The situation of the expeditionary army was fine. It was a sneak attack, and it was the enemy's tired soldiers. The casualties were only more than 2,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the glorious record of defeating 300,000 enemy troops, beheading 120,000, and taking 50,000 prisoners, it can be called an \"epic victory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's army did not suffer much, but the defenders of Fort Augustus suffered. As the bait thrown out by Hudson, the defenders killed a total of 70,000, and almost everyone who survived was wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for being trapped in the inner city with no place to run, with such a casualty figure, the army would have collapsed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the death toll of 70,000 also includes the loss of the outer city during the day. The battles are connected together, and the defenders have no way to separate the loss of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Arrange someone to pass the good news back! Everyone is waiting impatiently, and we need this news to stabilize people's hearts.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War always requires sacrifice, and in order to win, it is worth paying any price. Being able to win with the least cost proves that the commander is qualified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not comfort the wounded hearts of the officers of the Principality of Moxi, Hudson believed that they could all come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The casualties were heavy, and it was not worth mentioning in front of the good news. No matter how many troops are lost, the Principality of Moxi will make up for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many princes and nobles, the loss of soldiers has always been just a set of cold numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially among the defenders of Fort Augustus, there are still a large number of defeated soldiers of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, and now they are buried on the battlefield. Maybe they feel that a hidden danger has been eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel immediately replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he has adjusted his mentality. Whether it is a strong heart, or really don't care, these are the necessary qualities for a general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immersed in the subordinates, the people suffered heavy losses and could not extricate themselves. It seemed that they valued love and righteousness, but in fact it was an irresponsible approach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is ever-changing, no matter at any time, no matter what happens, the general must keep himself rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two of them tacitly did not mention the \"abandoned son attack\" deliberately arranged last night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city was broken by the enemy, and it was definitely not the coach who deliberately showed his flaws and led them into the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth can only be hidden in the long river of history, and there is no need to put everything on the surface. Sometimes knowing too much is not good for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether someone will guess it, it is not important at all, the winner is not to be blamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After nodding, Hudson added: \"The issue of the prisoners of war has also been reported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the hundreds of elf captives, I promised to abide by the ancient \"Covenant of Ten Thousand Races\" and give them the treatment of prisoners of war. How to deal with the rest of the prisoners of war is for the governments of the two countries to negotiate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remark: In order to politically lure the ancient survivors to surrender, it is not recommended to slaughter captives. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred of race wars is so deep that unless one side is completely down, the fight will continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Powerless to change the overall situation, but the promise he made must still be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone knows that the elf captive is valuable and it is impossible to pull it out and chop it, Hudson has to make a gesture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suggestions made later are actually decisions. Reporting is just a process to show respect for the high-level governments of the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment he spoke, the fate of fifty thousand prisoners of war had already been decided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the trend of future wars, coupled with the weight of \"good news\", it is impossible for any smart politician to reject Hudson's proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, apart from keeping these captives in order to carry out political surrender in the future, the core reason is that these ancient survivors belong to the cherished race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire alliance of the ancient survivors, even the largest race does not have a million people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the number of tribesmen, no matter how these small races develop, they do not have the ability to threaten the supremacy of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many races that have disappeared in the long river of history. These small races with extremely low resistance to risks may be cold at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A major earthquake, a major flood, an extreme cold weather, a cult rampage... Any major natural disasters and man-made disasters may destroy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Victory at Fort Augustus!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the news reached Da Pest, everyone's first reaction was to not believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yesterday, Fort Augustus was still asking for help, and everyone held a special meeting to discuss sending troops for reinforcements. Today, the good news came, so fooling the children!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being stared at by everyone, Earl Martins hurriedly explained: \"Reinforcements have arrived!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last night, the alien allied forces invaded the inner city. At the most dangerous moment, Marshal Hudson led the army to the battlefield and fought back with the defenders of Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this campaign, 300,000 enemy troops were defeated, 120,000 enemy troops were beheaded, and 50,000 enemy troops were captured, which completely reversed the unfavorable situation since the war began.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we also paid heavy casualties, the number of casualties alone is...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Minister of Military Affairs finished speaking, George interrupted: \"Stop!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let us digest this good news first, and we will talk about the casualties later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reversal of the war situation was too sudden. If everyone was not in good health, they would have been scared out of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply relying on the defenders of Fort Augustus, even if they were all wiped out, they would not be able to seriously injure the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of reinforcements from the Alpha Kingdom, everything will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi Principality is Hudson's famous place, and his influence here is greater than that in Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a victorious general, no matter what kind of great victory, as long as it is on his head, everyone can accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Congratulations, Your Majesty, after this battle, the strategically passive situation of the Principality will be completely reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may not be long before we receive news that Marshal Hudson is going to war against the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, everyone was prepared to fight on two fronts, but they never expected that Hudson would take down the enemy army as soon as he made a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are still hundreds of thousands of allied forces of the ancient survivors on the front line of Fort Augustus, the battle last night fundamentally changed the balance of strength between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the morale of the army. Before the arrival of the reinforcements, the morale of the Principality of Moxi was affected by the defeat of the army, and the combat effectiveness of ten percent could only be used to four or five points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the situation is reversed, it is the turn of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants to have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the army was frustrated, and the troops were scattered in various places to suppress the rebels. They could all see such an obvious fighter, so there's no reason the frontline coaches couldn't spot it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the counterattack war started, the battlefield was transferred from the Principality of Mosi to the Kingdom of East Warhammer. The northern provinces have a chance to breathe, and the principality's war potential will be preserved to the maximum extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the counter-offensive goes well, it can also affect the front line of the Principality of Orton, forcing the enemy to send troops back to help, and the follow-up war will be easier to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Now is not the time to celebrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom sent a small number of reinforcements this time. Nominally, there is an army of 100,000, but in fact there are only 35,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are all elite cavalry, with such a small force, they can only fight encounters in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not necessary, Marshal Hudson will not keep prisoners. You must know that in the last time the orcs invaded, he did not keep a single prisoner. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, he was thinking too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the orcs invaded, Hudson did not keep any prisoners because there were no prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom and the orcs have a deep hatred. When the people below see the orcs, they want to devour their flesh alive. To keep the captives is to fight against the officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the clear attitude of the high-level kingdom, directly ordering not to take prisoners, Hudson will naturally not violate the military order for a group of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the end of the war, in order to split the orc empire, Hudson deliberately let the vassal races go, and specifically caught the five royal families and beat them hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the intervention of the Human Race Alliance, Hudson was sent to do logistics and lost the dominance of the war, maybe the Orc Empire would have been torn apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is the same. It seems that Hudson is fighting the military, but in fact he is fighting the political battle together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this kind of gameplay is not in line with the mainstream of the Aslante continent, and there are no ready-made cases to learn from. Everyone didn't understand it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right. If there is only one enemy, the Allied Forces of the Remnants of the Ancients, our odds of winning the next war are indeed very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But apart from this enemy, there are also elves who have just joined the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three principalities of Kantruo, Usta, and Fick have been suppressed by the elves for a long time, and their own military strength is limited, so they can't resist for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Three Kingdoms fall, the elves army is likely to join forces in the Principality of Orton and the coalition forces of the ancient survivors. That will be the real test of life and death for the Principality! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato threw cold water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stabilize the elves, not only the Alpha Kingdom is working hard, but the Principality of Moxi has actually done more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea is beautiful, but the reality is very cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves racial strategic security, and it cannot be fooled by diplomatic means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The threat of the elves is indeed a big problem, but now we have to solve the alliance of the ancient survivors first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Martins, on behalf of the Principality, you personally go to the front line of Fort Augustus, ask Marshal Hudson about the next strategic deployment, and appease the morale of the army by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is any need on the front line, the Principality will do its best to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can hit the alliance of the ancient survivors before the arrival of the elf army, there will be more talk later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Victory is gratifying, but the deteriorating international situation still makes him uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one point, he wanted Hudson to lead the reinforcements southward, to deal with the ancient remnant army from the front line of Orton first, so that no one would resist when the elf army came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, reason finally prevailed. The reinforcements of the Alpha Kingdom were not under his command, and it would be embarrassing if the order was not followed by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The process is different, but the ultimate goal is astonishingly the same for everyone—to fool the army of elves away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, George was even mentally prepared. After the Continental War was over, he would act in the Terran Alliance and encourage the Alliance to launch a strategic strike against the Elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, the human race can easily disable the opponent if it takes action against any foreign race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Dragon and Sea clans cannot be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former has too many perverts, and the living area of ​​the latter is a forbidden area for human beings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the distance, Caesar IV received the good news a little later, but the joy brought by the victory remains the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big victory at the beginning made the ministers who were hesitant about this action all change their tunes and sing praises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of victory, armed training has turned into a surprise attack on the battlefield, and it has also become \"adapt to the situation and seize the opportunity\" among the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No problem, taking advantage of the enemy's siege to launch a surprise attack in the middle of the city and winning a big victory, a proper classic case of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smart nobles secretly took out their small notebooks and recorded what they learned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the teaching materials for the younger generations to learn in the future. In the era when there was no military academy system to train officers, the training of officers relied entirely on the accumulation of experience of the older generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heroes are all on the front line, so the celebration banquet is naturally saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Alpha Kingdom is implementing a strategic ration rationing system, and any extravagance and waste is not allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, whenever they appear in public, everyone eats black bread and vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by this, domestic entertainment venues, restaurants, and hotels have all been hit hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two cannot be combined, and the implementation of any policy cannot avoid trade-offs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, most parts of the kingdom implement the tax-subsidy system, and if they want to cry, the tax-subsidy guy will cry, and the commercial tax revenue of the treasury will hardly be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a person with vested interests, if you don't have this kind of dedication, then you don't have to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone has seen the battle report, what suggestions do you have for the handling of prisoners of war?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson only asked not to kill the prisoners, but did not say how to deal with the prisoners of war. The troops on the front line will continue to go out and have no time to watch the prisoners of war. The follow-up work will be taken over by the governments of the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the defenders of Fort Augustus suffered heavy losses, and the hatred has just been forged, and this moment is the time when the anger is the greatest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Mosi people want to receive prisoners of war, they must ensure that they cannot use the defenders and warhammers of Fort Augustus to detain them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hudson did not mention it, probably because he was concerned about the feelings of the frontline officers and soldiers. After all, they may need their cooperation in the following battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can test the Moxi people's thinking. If they have no special requirements, the two countries will jointly send troops to guard them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, the kingdom should immediately prepare a batch of anti-magic potions and give them to the prisoners of war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, other issues are easy to discuss. But the anti-magic potion cannot be produced by the Kingdom's family. There are 50,000 prisoners at the beginning of the war. It is not yet known how many people will be arrested in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of cultivators among them, even if it only accounts for one-tenth, the required anti-magic potion is a very large number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anti-magic potions on the market, even the most rubbish, cost 30 gold coins to start with. With such a large quantity, even if the kingdom organized production, the cost would probably not be less than ten gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of high-grade anti-magic potion for the strong is even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides cultivators, we also have to give them drugs to reduce their physical strength, otherwise it will be too difficult to take care of some races with special talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom's fiscal revenue is limited, and it may be unbearable to add huge expenses all of a sudden. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado objected immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allies also have to settle accounts clearly. It's fine to help fight the war, and it's no fun to help pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the proposal of the Minister of Finance has not been approved by everyone. It is true that the kingdom is short of finances. How can the Moxi Principality be rich during the war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, most of their magicians are now recruited to the battlefield, and the rest are also engaged in the production of military materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many difficulties in the first place, and if they are asked to produce anti-magic potions, they will not be able to do it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of everyone, it is a miracle that the Moxi Principality, which is heavily in debt, did not go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi cannot hold on and goes bankrupt during the war, and the mess left behind has to be taken over by the Alpha Kingdom, then it is really asking for trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Delgado, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can communicate with the Mosi people about the issue of magic potions, but considering the actual situation, the kingdom will most likely have to pay in advance for the required expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, under the current situation, we and the Moxi people are all damaged, so we can't care about that much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All issues will be discussed after the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No money means no money, and we cannot hope to extract oil from the poor. Talking after the war is purely a word of comfort. It is a miracle that the Mosi people did not declare bankruptcy after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the kingdom's finances will most likely go bankrupt after the war. The Treasury has done everything it can to amass money in order to wage this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some regions where the tax is paid by businessmen are expected to be 30 to 50 years later. Even the tax-encompassing area for nobles and lords has been received in advance five years later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, finances remain tight. There is no way, the mess left by the last war has not been cleaned up yet. Catch up with a new war again, leeks are not enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of rewards for military exploits was not even mentioned by anyone. Let's wait for a while, and settle the settlement after the war. At least the Ministry of Finance can reserve some cash in its hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic group is still conscious in this regard, and the great aristocrats personally take the lead and set an example, but no one makes a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the performance is outstanding on the battlefield, the officers from the great aristocrats will even reward them out of their own pockets. In order to boost the morale of the army, everyone also worked hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers and soldiers who followed Hudson gained the most, but he was grabbing supplies from the enemy to share the loot, not paying for it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Post-war processing is also okay, but the additional cost must be found a way to finance it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throttling is impossible, so only open source is left. Either impose a war tax, or collect a year's business tax in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can figure it out, anyway, the Ministry of Finance is powerless. If everyone has a better solution, the Ministry of Finance promises to fully support it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado spread his hands and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone wanted to speak up to refute, but they didn't know where to start. According to past experience, if a question is raised at this time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will immediately send a thick list of account expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the money was spent by the military. Strengthening the defense line, training the army, raising strategic materials, purchasing ordnance and equipment...all of these cost money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though most of the materials are prepared from within the country, gold coins are still used for settlement. Materials within the scope of the obligation do not require money, but kingdoms beyond the scope can also be bought with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's profits can be turned into debts, but the production costs still have to be paid, otherwise no one can hold on to the loss-making business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, the large sum of war bonds subscribed by the nobles of the kingdom basically came from this way. If it is true that everyone is asked to spend a huge amount of cash at one time during the war, few companies can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This number is still increasing, and Hudson has no time to report victory to the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of the disunity of the command of the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants was fully exposed at this moment. After the army was defeated, all ethnic groups could only fight on their own, and there was no effective resistance organized at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if hundreds of thousands of troops are integrated together, even if the morale of the army is frustrated, they can choose a dangerous terrain and stick to it for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the expeditionary force is, the total force is only that small, not to mention that they are all cavalry, so it is impossible to fight a tough battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy gave an opportunity, and Hudson naturally had to seize it. The benefits of taking prisoners are reflected at this moment. Many coalition soldiers chose to surrender when there was nothing they could do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of prisoners in his hands was too large, forcing Hudson to transfer a legion from the country to guard these prisoners of war with the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of poor information transmission, everyone relies on \"reputation\" for a living. If no one is sent to watch, who knows how many prisoners will be left in the end after handing them over to the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach has to take responsibility for what his subordinates do. Accumulating \"credibility and word of mouth\" is not easy, and Hudson is not willing to put his \"golden signature\" of doing what he says here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to fight continuously, in addition to the fact that the expeditionary force is all elites, the \"Ha's Magic Potion\" also contributed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the horses are the most injured when the cavalry raids long distances and fights continuously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is different. The war horse that took the magic potion is still in good spirits after completing the long-distance raid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the physical strength of the war horse can keep up, can the follow-up expansion of the victory be smooth. If it weren't for the insufficient strength of the expeditionary force, the record would have been even more prominent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the defenders of Fort Augustus, they were naturally left to deal with the corpses. After a bitter battle, the surviving officers and soldiers were severely injured physically and mentally, and urgently needed recovery and adjustment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five days later, standing under the former steel defense line of the Warhammer Kingdom, Hudson complained helplessly: If you don't die, you won't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It used to be the forefront of the Warhammer Kingdom's resistance to the orc invasion, and once prevented hundreds of thousands of orc troops from advancing, but now only weeds and rubble are left on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war years, unfortunately meeting a prodigal king can really kill a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that I have lived a comfortable and comfortable life for too long, forgetting that the essence of the world is that the weak eat the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain the royal power, there is no problem with the balance of the game, but the prerequisite is that the two sides can balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, Hudson was also a beneficiary of the failure of Joseph II's balance policy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lessons learned from the past were there, and everyone was frightened, so that after the outbreak of the mainland war, all the major forces in the kingdom pushed him out to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    balance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of military common sense can see that the Alpha Kingdom has a very low probability of winning if it concentrates all its forces; if the army is divided into two, then the battle will be impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army stops pursuing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During yesterday's pursuit, no more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed, and only more than 300 prisoners were captured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the five-digit daily record at the beginning to the three-digit record now, the results are getting more and more unremarkable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the soldiers didn't work hard, it's mainly because after a few days of fleeing, the defeated soldiers had long gone to nowhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best time to expand the results of the battle has passed, and there will be little gain if you continue to hunt down. On the contrary, it is possible to be ambushed by the enemy because of the dispersion of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than deal with each race one by one, Hudson would rather wait for the alien races to get together before sending troops to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"1+1\" may be greater than 2, but \"1+1+1\" will be less than 3. The more races gathered together, the more internal problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal friction will always be the number one enemy of the \"Alliance\", and Hudson believes in the destructive power brought by pig teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war has already planted the seeds of differences. Also encountered a surprise attack, some races were wiped out, some races were seriously injured, and some races retreated completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The race that retreated completely was the first to run away; the race that was completely wiped out reacted a step slower and passively blocked the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't suffer from scarcity but unevenness. Seeing that their own family has suffered heavy losses, but their allies are unscathed, anyone's heart will be unbalanced!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Hudson guessed, the alliance of the ancient survivors, thousands of miles away, is in a mess at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since receiving the news, all parties have been arguing non-stop. When a battle is lost, someone has to be responsible for it. In particular, it is necessary to give the elves an explanation for leaving the elf magician group on the battlefield with unknown life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things are so obvious, why bother. If there is a big defeat on the front line, someone must have become a deserter. If everyone fights to the end like my giant family, the ending will definitely be different!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, those who escaped first must be arrested, and the military law is used to deter the entire army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king took the lead in making trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a big race, their size is the guiding light on the battlefield. Other races can sneak away, but they can't!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were already few people, but now the entire army of one thousand giants on the front line has been wiped out, making the giant family even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the members of my family were killed in battle, but some allies withdrew the troops in an organized way. After a little speculation, I knew that they were betrayed by teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The giant king calm down, we can't jump to conclusions until the matter is investigated clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether there are any deserters from various ethnic groups in the alliance will be discussed after the parties are found. No one is here, if you make a mistake, wouldn't it be chilling for the people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The macaque king persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the bottom of his heart, he didn't want to be this early bird. After all, the giant king's fists and violent temper are well-known in the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite the news from the front line, the macaque family was also the first to evacuate. Whether it was the first to run away or one of the first races to run away is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the giant king's proposal is followed, the army of the macaque tribe will definitely be held accountable, and there is a high probability that they will be listed as negative models and severely punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was difficult to withdraw from the front line and preserve the strength of the race. How could these younger brothers die in the hands of \"our own people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Direct opposition is not enough, so just delay. Anyway, the army is on the front line, and the alliance will not be able to reach it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find an opportunity later, let them sneak back to the clan area secretly, and declare their death in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hang Xin, what's so chilling?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the battle situation is unfavorable, a strategic shift must be carried out, at least the magician group must be brought along!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoning the magician group and fleeing alone, this is the first time I have encountered such an anecdote through the ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that some people think that the elf magician group is not their own anyway, so it's okay to lose it, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To fight against the human race, the Alliance of Ancient Remnants must rely on the power of the elves. If it weren't for the joining of the Elven Mage Group, maybe they are still entangled with the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to escape for his own life, he lost the magician group aided by his allies, and he obviously couldn't explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dead don't need to take responsibility, and they don't have the ability to take responsibility, so the blame can only be borne by the living.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are not easy to mess with. Everyone relies on the power of the alliance to be qualified to talk to the elves, but it doesn't mean that everyone is the same race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of offending the human race, and then offending the elves, it is obvious that they are not going to mess around on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the atmosphere in the room was becoming more and more tense, the Multiclaw King on the side smoothed things over and said, \"Okay, both of you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is too chaotic, and the news we receive may not be accurate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf magician group broke out, but they were only temporarily out of contact with us, and it may not be impossible. Might as well wait until the rout is gathered before discussing these issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority is still the frontline battle situation. The army of the Eastern Expedition was defeated, and the coalition forces of the Alphas and the Mossi may march straight in at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the Warhammer Kingdom of the West is still relying on the mountainous terrain to carry out the final stubborn resistance; within the Kingdom of the Eastern Warhammer, there are also several rebel forces, large and small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the human army comes back and unites with these armed forces, it will definitely pose a serious threat to our local rule. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing question. The lands of the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms have been divided into their own spheres of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the prior agreement, whoever's troubles will be solved. The progress ahead was so smooth that everyone didn't take the scattered resistance forces seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the human army is about to come over, everything will be different. If the enemy cannot be kept out of the door, there will be endless troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The East and West Warhammer Kingdoms are in turmoil, and the army sent to attack the Principality of Orton will be in danger. In case of being cut off by the human army, it might be another big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidence is so mysterious. When they were making great strides before, everyone didn't pay attention to the human race at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having just experienced a big defeat, it immediately reminded them that the human race is the overlord of the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If there is anything to discuss, hurry up and organize the army to reinforce the front line. The East and West Warhammer Kingdoms were brought down by us, and we must never fall into the hands of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I have had enough of the days of ice and snow. If we are driven back this time, I am afraid we will have to continue migrating to the depths of the ice and snow world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race gets ruthless, it is not impossible to directly exterminate us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone chose to come out to gamble on the luck of the clan at this moment, and they thought it was because they saw the current situation in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance wins, we still have a chance to breathe; if the human race wins again, all races in the mainland will face the test of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the elves, let's do the posture first. Now is the time to use troops. For the sake of the overall situation, they should give us a chance to perform. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King's words brought everyone back to reality. Things have already happened, and shirking responsibility will not solve any problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you say it, you have to go through this hurdle first. As for the further intensification of conflicts within the alliance, everyone has seen it, but there is nothing they can do about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the multi-ethnic alliance system, it is okay to fight with the wind. If there is a big rout, the scene of Fort Augustus will continue to repeat itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is meaningless to talk about the overall situation. For small races, the first thing to think about is to continue the racial inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driven by this kind of thinking, when they make decisions, they have to choose to give priority to preserving their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Cantero, after a series of defeats, the elves have besieged the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was about to take down the royal city, and let the world know how powerful the elves army is, but at this time, they received the bad news of the defeat of their allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What happened on the Eastern Front, what kind of battle are those idiots from the Alliance of Ancient Remnants fighting?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Forest Elf Queen asked in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a few days ago, she received the news that the coalition forces of the ancient survivors had the absolute upper hand, and the defense line of Fort Augustus was just around the corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that the turning point would come so quickly. A little carelessness can turn a big victory into a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Queen, the Alpha Kingdom has dispatched troops. According to the news from the front line, Marshal Hudson of the Alpha Kingdom personally led an army of 100,000 troops and rushed two hundred miles to launch a night attack on the Allied Forces of the Ancient Remnants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the allied forces of the ancient survivors had just entered the fortress of Fort Augustus, and the main force was fighting fiercely in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time they reacted, the camp had already fallen into the hands of the enemy. He could only retreat from the city in a hurry to meet the enemy, but he was defeated miserably!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magician group we sent to support the Alliance of Ancient Remnants also ran out of magic power due to previous battles and fell into the hands of the enemy. It is currently unknown whether they are alive or dead. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the old man finished speaking, the elf queen's face turned green with anger. It's okay for the allies to lose the battle, but even the reinforcements they sent out were trapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That is a group of magicians. There are more than twenty eighth-level magicians in it, and even the weakest one is a fifth-level magician.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending this carefully selected team, in addition to providing support to allies, also means showing off force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that the magician group was guarded by a large army, and there was not much danger. This trip was just a tour at public expense, but the reality was too embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the Ancient Remnant Alliance all idiots, who don't know how to retreat after losing a battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, Remo Priest is mature and prudent. If you encounter danger, you will definitely lead your team to retreat. Something must have happened in the middle! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf queen said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The alliance of the ancient survivors is too chaotic, and all races only report to themselves. The clear reports we collected are incomplete, and we can't figure out the details in a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, our people failed to evacuate, and it is very likely that they were intercepted by human masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander-in-chief who led the army this time, Hudson, is himself a top powerhouse on the mainland. His own strength has always been a mystery. What is certain is that this person has a dragon suspected of being the Dragon King and a Sanctuary Earth Bear following him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This person became famous in the last battle between the orcs and the human race. He has turned the tide several times and helped the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Alpha to stabilize the war situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since his debut, Hudson has experienced countless battles and has not lost a single one so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that this person uses troops very strangely, unable to ponder, especially good at defeating the strong with the weak. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the old man's explanation, the forest elf queen also hesitated. The top powerhouses in the mainland are superimposed and good at using troops, and they are well-rounded commanders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such an enemy, many methods are not easy to use. For example: there is no way to cast the most frightening forbidden spell of the elf magician group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to use the forbidden spell, you must let the strong in the sanctuary pass. Only those who understand the rules will not encounter backlash due to interference in casting spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to ordinary forbidden spells. If you use some big moves beyond your own strength, once you are disturbed, the backlash will be immediate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have heard about the fourth dragon knight in the mainland, but unfortunately I have never seen it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a chance to meet him on the battlefield, I really want to see whether this dragon bear knight is powerful or mine...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a fighting spirit emanated from the elf queen, and the strong coercion made the nearby elf maids retreat again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this situation didn't last long, and the elf queen restrained her, and once again restored her former elegance, as if nothing had happened.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With the subsequent record, the Augustsburg victory killed and captured more than 200,000 enemy troops, which is really unbelievable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's as if the coalition army of the ancient survivors is a weak chicken, and they can be slapped to death casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in the previous battles, the Allied Forces of the Remnants of Ancient Times killed all directions, and their strength is obvious to all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the generals of the major forces are busy now. The mainland has added another classic case, which must be studied in depth to prevent similar tragedies from happening to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the human forces are doing well, and the situation in the North Continent has improved, which is also a good thing for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are accidents in everything, and Pius VII is very upset now. Without the courage to go to the misty sea to find the ghost ship, the blame for the destruction of the Holy See fleet naturally fell on the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that facing the threat of the three major alien races, this thorn in the side, the thorn in the flesh, would soon be severely injured, and even disappear in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII considered himself a magnanimous person, and he would not care about past grievances with the dead, so he simply ignored the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the news of the Augustsburg victory came out, the situation changed instantly. The Alliance of Ancient Survivors lived in a world of ice and snow with scarce resources, which meant that their number of clansmen was limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one-time loss of 200,000 troops exceeded the total population of some races. Counting the losses in the previous series of battles, since the outbreak of the war, the Alliance of Ancient Survivors has lost at least 300,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number, placed on any big force, will feel pain in the flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two or three more times, or even one more time, the Alliance of Ancient Survivors may be forced to abandon the strategic plan to invade the Principality of Moxi because they cannot bear the casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The essence of their war is to win the living space for the clansmen. If the clansmen are gone, what's the use of holding the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"They are all a bunch of trash, they can be attacked even if they attack a city, no wonder they can only linger in the corner of the ice and snow world!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ancient Remains Alliance, I think it's better to change its name to: Ancient Waste Alliance. They have been passed down to the present, and they are polluting the eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are also a bunch of idiots. They don't even know what their allies are, so they just watch the fire from the other side. No wonder they can only hide in a corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also those ignorant orcs who know how to entangle with the countries on the prairie all day long, and forget who their real enemies are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is worried, I really don't know how they passed down from ancient times...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII roared and greeted the three major alien races in the Northern Continent all over, without even caring about his image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, judging from the current situation, I'm afraid it's not these alien wastes, but they didn't expect Hudson to be so powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if you don't make a move, this move is to break the backbone of the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multi-racial alliance is inherently unstable, and its ability to withstand losses is far lower than that of a normal large force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the elves can't destroy the three major duchies quickly and provide them with more support, the Alliance of Ancient Remnants is likely to become the first alien race to be eliminated in the continental war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said with lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the Knights of Judgment, it is not all based on the status of connections. He still has some military literacy, and he can see the flaws in the army of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the series of boring losses he suffered during his dealings with Hudson, he still can't let go of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson, the enemy, killing all directions, he felt both uncomfortable and relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inside and outside of the words reveal everything, it is really not his master Blake who is rubbish, but the enemy is too powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the aliens who suffered heavy losses, when he clashed with Hudson on the prairie battlefield, he only lost part of the right to speak, which is already considered very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been a man with his tail between his legs for several years, now that he has a foreign background, Blake naturally wants to clear his name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson is indeed a threat. It's just that this person is guarded by giant dragons and earth bears. It may be difficult to get rid of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at the reaction of the aliens. If Hudson is so prominent, the elves should make a move. In the eyes of those arrogant elves, such a character should not appear in the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, our influence in the Northern Continent has almost been wiped out. If you want to intervene in the affairs over there, it is beyond your reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the necessary preparations still need to be carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom is destroyed in the continental war, then everything will be over; if they are still strong, we can't let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To defeat a kingdom, it is far easier to start from the inside than to attack head-on. The master is weak and the minister is strong, which is the way to seek disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Hudson is so outstanding, let's help him promote it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number one **** of war in the mainland, the number one powerhouse in the mainland, the number one in the mainland...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You guys look at the compilation, and give me all the hats that can be put on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember, this time we only publicize his merits, and it must be carried out subtly, so that the outside world cannot find out that we are behind the scenes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all bosses, and he is very aware of the complex psychology of those in positions of power. Usually it is: I want my subordinates to be capable, but I am afraid that my subordinates are too capable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It won't happen if the rabbit dies, but it will definitely happen. The stronger the propaganda, the stronger the backlash will be in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once there is a conflict between the two sides, no matter who wins or loses, it will weaken the national strength of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be more perfect if a civil war broke out directly like the Warhammer Kingdom, and the country was forced to be divided into two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to achieve his goal, Pius VII was not even prepared to take the title of \"the most powerful man in the mainland\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fame wears on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of the strongest person in the mainland can not only bring fame, but also bring trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Whenever a big monster that cannot be dealt with emerges, it will be the turn of the strongest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status is there, and many times it is impossible to shirk it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really powerful and surpasses the mainland, then it will be fine. But Pius VII has a guilty conscience, he, the number one powerhouse in the mainland, is too watery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Missing two inherited artifacts, he is just a **** meat shield, and his real combat power is far inferior to that of several dragon knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one day a strong iron man emerges and wants to challenge him, the number one power in the pseudo-continent, it will be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, wise!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't cost a single soldier, just give up a little reputation, and planted a hidden danger of internal fighting for the Alpha Kingdom, really...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the flattery of all his subordinates, Pius VII couldn't help but smile slightly. When it comes to manipulating people's hearts, he is a professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Augustus, the **** scene has been washed away. Only the collapsed city walls and the remnants everywhere tell the cruelty of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defenders who survived the catastrophe became fierce after experiencing the test of life and death. Wherever you stand, the surrounding temperature will drop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ended the expansion of the results, and the expeditionary force was also withdrawn by Hudson to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Excellent hunters never lack patience. They will only shoot a critical arrow at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, something is wrong!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Last night, the elves broke into the capital of the Duke of Kantruh, and all the high-level officials of the Principality, including the king, were unfortunately killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick issued a strong warning. If no reinforcements appeared, they would surrender to the elves! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is very obvious. The destruction of the Principality of Kantruo has frightened the senior officials of the Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of life and death, the high-level leaders of the two countries, who could not see any hope, did not hesitate to threaten surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the barriers of the three principalities disappear, the army of the elves can meet with the coalition forces of the ancient survivors at any time. The two great alien races teamed up, and no one can bear it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson also hesitated. After finally gaining a little strategic initiative on the battlefield, how do you want to give it up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he realized that it was his fault. So far in the war, the large-scale acceptance of prisoners has only occurred at the Battle of Augustsburg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick dared to threaten to surrender. Obviously, the elves sent them a signal to surrender and made certain promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the other side doesn't keep any prisoners, then it's a ghost to surrender. You must fight to the death!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Raquel, immediately send someone to inform the capital and ask them to strengthen intelligence gathering on the elf army, especially to confirm whether they are now carrying out large-scale genocide!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stays on the line, and we will meet again in the future. If the elves really change their way of playing in the continental hegemony, the countries in the northern continent may not even have room to struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To fight to the end is to be forced and helpless, but if there is a chance of life, how many people are willing to die?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps some nobles may choose to fight to the end for glory. But more people will shrink back in the face of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that the probability of such a thing happening was very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are not a race that likes to kill. If they are allowed to slaughter all the way, I am afraid that the mentality of many elves will collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing this, Hudson is not going to continue to be silent. If you don't have a fighter, create one yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the ancient survivors are gathering. If they take the initiative to attack and kill the troops of several tribes, it is still very possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crossing the Warhammer Kingdom, directly entering the lairs of various races in the ice and snow world, forcing them to return to aid.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, Hudson dismissed it. In this season of ice and snow world, many areas have already started to snow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivators are indeed more frost-resistant, but lacking logistical supplies, it is also risky to break into other people's lairs directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such precedent in the continent of Aslant, but there are so many negative teaching materials in the previous life, Hudson knows how terrible the power of cold winter is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, there is no need to investigate specifically. The elf army did not slaughter wantonly, they only killed all the young and old, and then drove away the old, weak, women and children in the controlled area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large part of the refugees who flooded into the Principality were driven over by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this matter, the Principality also held a meeting to analyze it, and finally came to the conclusion: This is to weaken our war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the principality as an example, in order to guarantee the basic needs of the refugees in the territory, at least thousands of tons of food and supplies must be paid every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because a large number of refugees died on the road, otherwise the consumption would be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality simply cannot afford the huge consumption of materials. The topic of whether to rescue refugees has been debated endlessly at the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until you stepped in and promised to open restrictions on accepting refugees, the situation improved slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the Principality of Cantrue is destroyed, the number of refugees will increase sharply in the future. I am afraid that it will be difficult in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lackel's explanation brought Hudson back to reality, and then he took a deep breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf army's approach seems to be better than massacres, but in fact the hidden purpose is more vicious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention those who died on the road, they were all refugees made up of the old, the weak, women and children. In the war years when supplies were scarce, that was a proper burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting refugees consumes a lot of supplies; leaving them alone will harm the place. Once a person's stomach is extremely hungry, no moral bottom line will exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hudson understood why the Moxi people agreed when he asked for refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In times of war, the least valuable thing is human life. Fortunately, the definition of \"old\" in the continent of Aslant is different, otherwise there would be no males in the refugee ranks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sick population ratio, Hudson doesn't know what to do next. Perhaps the \"European romance\" in the previous life was caused by the aftermath of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since this is the case, there is no need to waste time. Raquel, immediately arrange for someone to prepare dry food and fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dry food is mainly dried meat and cheese. Prepare half a pound of salt for each person, and if possible, prepare some sugar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forage must be high-quality fine material...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it was a long-distance raid, the expeditionary force naturally did not carry much supplies. Now that he has arrived in the Principality of Moxi, the logistical supplies will naturally be provided by the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elite troops must receive elite treatment. On the continent of Aslant, where productivity is lagging behind, logistical supplies also appear monotonous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially \"sugar\" has become a luxury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the backward production technology, the production of sugar in Aslante Continent is extremely limited, and the price is more expensive than gold, which is usually reserved for nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting sugar enter the army as a strategic material was first proposed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can Kingdom's sugar production is too low, and the annual production of 3,000 pounds in the Mountain Territory accounts for one-tenth of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson doesn't work hard, it's really that the sugar making process is not good enough. Where is the total output stuck? Even if the food is taken from the mouth of the nobles, it is not enough for the soldiers to share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, other materials are easy to talk about. Even if you put together things, you can get them out, but sugar...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you report to the capital, you may be able to scrape together a hundred and eighty pounds. In the frontline army, it is really...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The major domestic forces, including the royal family, have reached an agreement to prevent the king from intervening in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to internal pressure, Caesar IV could only choose to endure. One day or two days, you can comfort yourself by taking care of the overall situation. No one can stand the depression for a long time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unknowingly, Caesar IV's temper is also increasing day by day. It's just that it is well concealed in normal times, and it is rarely exposed in front of outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The help letters from Ustad Principality and Fick Principality became sparks that detonated the powder keg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a wave of venting, Caesar IV, who calmed down, gradually calmed down. No matter how much you scold, you have to face reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't that they were forced to the wall, Usta and Fick could never do such a thing. Surrender is easy to say, but extremely difficult to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continental war is in a stalemate. Both the human race and the alien alliance have their own advantages and disadvantages. No one can judge the final outcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this situation, standing on the wrong team is very fatal. In case the human race wins a big victory, Qiuhou will calculate the score, and the guy who surrendered to the alien race will not even think about running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Duchy of Ustad and the Duchy of Fick wrote such letters, most likely because they were stimulated by the fall of the Duchy of Kantruu, and acted impulsively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, the top leaders of the two countries should make rational choices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, both sides are covered with each other's blood, and the unforgettable hatred has been forged, and it is not so easy to unravel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the elves, the status of the Ustas and Feks is destined not to be high, and they may be deliberately tossed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there is oppression, there will be resistance. Over time, their local ruling foundation will be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the case for building alien wins. If the Terrans win a big victory, they will be liquidated immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surrender of the Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick has a great impact on the situation in the North Continent. This is the reason why everyone must rescue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But no matter how good the reason is, the actual situation must also be considered. Except for a few neighboring countries, even if other countries want to send reinforcements, it will take a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the kingdom as an example, according to the normal situation, it will take two months to arrive at the earliest when forming reinforcements, preparing strategic materials for the expedition, and adding the time for marching all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the situation of the Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick, not to mention resisting the elf army for two months, they can persist for another month, which is the favor of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they threatened not really wanting reinforcements, but wanting to use the last bargaining chip in their hands in exchange for a promise from all parties. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis analyzed rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surrender has completely ruined its foundation, which is equivalent to slow suicide; resisting a narrow escape may not necessarily be able to keep the basic market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the extreme situation where the high-level group of the Duchy of Cantrue was wiped out, even if all the high-level leaders of the two countries withdraw safely, the restoration of the country has become a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race wins a big victory, the lost land will definitely be regained, but it is hard to say whether they are the masters of the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major forces of the human race are not doing charity. Sending troops to recover the lost land is not only for the righteousness of the human race, but also to divide up the corresponding interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Land of No Man is not enough, so we can only grab the soft persimmons and forcefully divide the benefits to appease the heroes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapsed Principality of Kantruo, as well as the soon-to-be-finished Principalities of Ustad and Fick, are all soft persimmons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take advantage of the time when you can talk, to fight for some rights and interests, not only will you lose your noble status after the war, you may lose your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the obligation is fulfilled, everyone will naturally not touch them on the surface, but it is difficult to say secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infighting among the aristocratic group is also very intense. If you have no strength in your hands and block the way of others, you can imagine the fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you want to negotiate terms, it depends on what they want. The Kingdom can guarantee that it will not seek the interests of the two of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we are not the one who has the final say on the continent of Yaslant, and we cannot control what other big forces think.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the post-war kingdom's national strength will inevitably be weakened. There is a high probability that the right to speak in the North Continent will also be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they want us to stand out and give an exact guarantee, I'm afraid they are thinking too much. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said unhappily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom has enough troubles of its own, and it is not bad to be able to protect its own interests after the war, so there is no need to care about others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The threat of Ustad Principality and Fick Principality undoubtedly pierced this layer of window paper, allowing everyone to face the reality of the kingdom's imminent decline in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anger is anger, but the Grand Duke of Newfoundland is not panicking. As long as a big country is not corrupted internally, even if it declines due to external forces for a short period of time, it will recover quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Judging from the current strategic situation, the Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick are still valuable, we need them to buy time for Marshal Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs may wish to contact them. As long as the two countries can resist to the end, we can promise to support their restoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The level of support is linked to their resistance. As long as they can hold back the elf army for another two months, the kingdom will do its best to support them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke Afiero drew the pie without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a country with a territory of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, it seems that there is no difficulty in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies for two hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is in theory, the elves are scrambling for time, and they don't need to occupy every inch of land. As long as people win the main strategic points, the army can continue to march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to hold back the elf army, you can only block the only way they must pass, and stick to the fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let alone two months. It is a miracle that the Duchy of Ustad and the Duchy of Fick can persist for another month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of being close to the elves, their military strength has always been suppressed, and the standing army in peacetime is less than 30,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of strong people is even pitifully small, and almost no arrogance is born. Occasionally a few geniuses are born, and accidents happen soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of the younger generations, the great nobles of the two countries usually send outstanding younger generations abroad for training, and they will only return when their strength reaches a certain level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the current complicated situation, it was too late for them to transfer their children, let alone recall the children who had gone out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Francis shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Painting cakes also needs to pay attention to skills. If you can be sure at a glance, this cake can be seen but not eaten, and it can't fool people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, \"support\" and \"guarantee\" are completely different concepts in the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supporting them to restore the country can be supported by actual actions or by words. It is too far from guaranteeing that they can return to the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding national reputation, this kind of public promise must basically be fulfilled as long as it is made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's do this!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what choices the Ustad Principality and Fick Principality make, our bottom line is here. It is possible to support their post-war restoration, but we cannot guarantee it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that all countries in the mainland cannot give such a guarantee. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should work hard to make them realize the reality as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs reported the matter to Marshal Hudson, asking him to seize the time to defeat the coalition forces of the ancient survivors as soon as possible. The time left for the kingdom is running out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV waved his hand and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he didn't want to interfere with the frontline command. The increasingly complicated situation had already made him breathless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of his personal opinion of Hudson, Hudson is the hope of the kingdom right now. The future fate of the kingdom depends entirely on the situation on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of the foundation of the ancestors, there is no room for willfulness. If not, before the expeditionary force set off, he would not deliberately get closer to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a superficial effort, it is better than nothing. At least it sent a signal to the outside world, the relationship between the king and the marshal is very close.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have contacted the resistance forces in the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom. According to the information they provided, the enemy is gathering in Deklas Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the gathered enemy troops are no less than 200,000. More detailed information is still under investigation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Tom's report, Hudson was shocked, and directly found the location of the Deklaas Province on the map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief pause in his gaze, Hudson was speechless. The enemy was so frightened that they chose to assemble in a mountainous province hundreds of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry is powerful in combat, but cavalry combat is also very challenging in terrain. It is definitely easier for cavalry to fight in plains than in mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is fully prepared, and it is almost impossible to launch a big surprise attack to severely damage the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What worries Hudson the most is that the enemy doesn't come out to fight him, but hides in the city, wasting time with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the enemy has been frightened by you, and I'm afraid they won't fight us easily in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is on the enemy's side. They just need to wait for the elves army to kill them, and the two sides will meet in the Duke of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the army of the Alliance of Ancient Remains in the Principality of Orton may suddenly turn around and attack the Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick with the elf army first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy makes up his mind to delay the time and directly defend the city, it may be difficult for us to obtain results in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose analyzed with a frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the current situation, the pressure on the expeditionary force is too great. In order to severely injure the Ancient Remnants Alliance with limited forces, it is also necessary to race against time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the enemy doesn't come out, then mobilize them to come out. Pass down the order to let the army pack their bags and set off early tomorrow morning!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can temporarily abandon the vast land of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, but do they dare to give up the retreat of the coalition forces?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interspersed behind enemy lines, I will see how long they can hide in Deklaas Province. If they don't fall for the trick, then go all the way from the Warhammer Great Plains to the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all enemies anyway, so it's the same to deal with their main force over there first! Just after the fight, you can also see the army of elves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it easily, but deep down he and Jose came to the same conclusion, this war is difficult to fight!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy didn't dare to fight him until the main force was assembled. If the opponent is allowed to complete the assembly, it will become Hudson who dare not go to court for death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how elite the troops under his command are, it is impossible to attack the prepared hundreds of thousands of army camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best fighter is always in motion. The high mobility of the cavalry is born to fight mobile warfare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Hudson had already prepared for the worst. No matter how the situation develops, the first thing he needs to ensure is that the army under his command will not suffer a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not his style to rush to the battlefield to gamble on luck in order to seize time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he has tried his best and is worthy of the title of marshal. If the situation is corrupt, it will be corrupt, and this is not something he can control alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to block the army of elves from the country, the big deal is to go back to fight the homeland defense war, which is nothing more than suffering the border provinces of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the addition of an orc empire, the flames of war will not reach the southeast coast for a while, and the safety of the old nest is relatively guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the elves don't stick to the kingdom, and the kingdom persists until the end of the continental war, Hudson is still sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flander Kingdom, after a series of bitter battles, they had to withdraw their main force back to Xingang for the final resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, the Kingdom of Light has fallen?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Philip I exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Light and the Farland Kingdom are the most powerful among the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, and the two countries have persisted the longest in the face of the invasion of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the fall of allies one by one, only the two countries are still making the final insistence. Unexpectedly, when he woke up, the last ally was gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting alone, or fighting alone without reinforcements, this feeling is really not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Majesty!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bright Kingdom broke through last night, and it is unknown how many people escaped. Anyway, their king has fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the entire prairie, only the kingdom is left to make the final resistance. If nothing else happened, the orcs would definitely step up their attack on Xingang next. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Draai replied bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes a war that continues to be fought even though it knows it can't be won.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with all the unlucky allies, the situation of Farland Wheel Kingdom is much better. The capital is at the port, so you can run away at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current fierce resistance is mainly because everyone is making political capital. The most important thing is: Run ahead of time, the Alpha Kingdom refuses to let them pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life safety is guaranteed, so fight slowly! Anyway, there is nothing to be done, and they can board the ship and leave.

Especially those who immigrated by land suffered the heaviest losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, in such a result, the coastal nobles took advantage of the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on the convenience of sea transportation, taking the lead in getting their own share, more noble lords can only stare blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, now everyone can't care about the trivial matters of \"refugees\". As soon as the Kingdom of Light collapsed, the military pressure on the provinces in northern Xinjiang suddenly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Became neighbors with the orcs again. With the grievances between the two sides, it is normal for the enemy to kill him at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change in the situation forced the kingdom to hold another military meeting. Even Hudson, the expeditionary general, was recalled to attend the defense meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The northern border defense line has not been completed yet, what are the guys on the front line doing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, yelled angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as the rehearsal of the Continental War began, the kingdom restarted the construction of the defense line in the northern border. The kingdom allocates construction funds and materials, and the lords in the border areas are responsible for the implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the Alpha Kingdom is also rich in experience, and has already summed up a set of experiences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The line of defense guards their own territory, so there is no need to worry about the participants not working hard. Even if some small nobles are different, there are still governors and sheriffs watching over them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the lords in the border area are from the generation of entrepreneurs, and their ability is obviously not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the progress of the defense line construction is still not as good as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, everyone has done their best. It's just that the human resources in the border area are limited, and there are not enough building materials nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially stone is the most scarce, and there are no quarries in many areas. We can only fire bricks instead, which virtually increases the process. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Albert spoke in defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are real issues, and Hudson can testify that there is a real shortage of building materials in the border area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are all the fault of the lords themselves. Taking advantage of the defeat of the orc empire, the kingdom moved the border northward again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, after a group of fief nobles arrived, they did a better job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not very clear about how much land the circle occupies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I heard that a baronie in northern Xinjiang is bigger than a viscount in the interior, and the viscount directly surpasses the earl, and even the earl can catch up with some small provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct evidence is: the unfinished line of defense in the hands of Hudson that year has now become the kingdom's third line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the area was sparsely populated, but after such an expansion, human resources became even scarcer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, we can't blame everyone for being greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the ability to predict, no one knew that the mainland war would break out so soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If fighting starts at night for decades, when the seven grassland countries gain a firm foothold, these areas will be the heart of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson were to work hard in northern Xinjiang, he would not give up this once-in-a-lifetime expansion opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't there a laborer sent to you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, you are the first to pick the refugees who are pouring in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now complaining about the lack of manpower, why did you go there earlier?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building materials are scarce, so build earth walls!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Add some magic materials into it, arrange a magic circle, and the defense is also not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking so much of the kingdom's budget, don't you think it's ridiculous to run away and complain now? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado snorted angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to raise funds for the front line, the Treasury Department has tightened its belt. Now that the results handed over are not as good as expected, he is naturally upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the eyes of the powerful and powerful in the kingdom, the border governors of northern Xinjiang were like frost-beaten eggplants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of manpower and lack of raw materials are just excuses. In essence, the border nobles are too poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have no guts to deduct the funds for the construction of the defense line, but the diversion of funds has not rarely occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blind optimism in the early stage delayed the progress of the project. After the outbreak of the Continental War, everyone became active, but the huge construction project could not be completed in a few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core thing is that the construction period is too tight, especially after the situation has become increasingly tense, the Kingdom's requirements for the construction period have been shortened repeatedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The problem of the defense line, let's stop here for today!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They didn't do it deliberately. No one thought of the early collapse of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now change the strategy, put together some temporary lines of defense for the unfinished part, and focus on strengthening the defense of the core strategic nodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a punishment for poor construction, the noble lords responsible for the construction were all stationed at strategic locations along the line. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the truth, he has no time to pursue it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the defense line is filled with water or not, whoever uses it knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you cut corners, you will pay with your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the flames of war are ignited, all problems will be exposed. Don't look at Hudson's serious face on the surface, but deep down he is not panicking at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several newly recovered provinces in northern Xinjiang have been smashed, and the five nobles of the northern land will take over. Starting from their territory, there are fortresses all the way to the king's capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has only been a few years, as long as it is not a tofu project, it will definitely be usable now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, after the outbreak of the Continental War, the aristocratic lords along the way spontaneously organized manpower to maintain and strengthen the fortress castles within their own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the orc empire in its heyday came here, a few front teeth would be knocked out, let alone the orcs who are now decimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the situation on the Western Front is more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the war on the northern front is imminent, shouldn't it be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Count Oran could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"The kingdom will naturally send reinforcements, but it must be done in an orderly manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same force is distributed in various provinces and sent to northern Xinjiang, and the material consumption required is not at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic materials raised by the Kingdom are limited, only one-third of what they were before the outbreak of the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all countries in the mainland are busy with their own wars, and they don't care about us at all. Next, we can only use limited strategic materials to fight an infinite battle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the strategy of the kingdom, the old man's face is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can explode soldiers in a short period of time, but there is no way to explode strategic materials in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to win a war, some sacrifices are necessary. It's just that there are things that can be done, but definitely not said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had the idea of ​​letting Beijiang be smashed, but in terms of specific actions, Hudson dared not show it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, all the nobles in the north could tear him apart. It's better to leave this kind of hatred thing to the \"last resort\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unfinished line of defense is just the No. 1 backer. Insufficient strategic materials belong to the No. 2 back-up man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will be more blamers appearing in the future, proving that it is not that Master Hudson does not work hard, but that objective conditions do not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, since the strategic materials are insufficient, let's make a quick decision in northern Xinjiang!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrate your forces to defeat the orc army first, and then...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Duke Hiro finished speaking, Hudson shook his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, when there is not much difference in strength, quick battles are never unilateral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are not fools, why should they fight us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough for them to hold back our main force and create time for the two major alien races on the Western Front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency is more familiar with the situation on the grassland than I am. If the orc army doesn't fight us decisively, is it possible for the kingdom's army to go deep into the prairie and fight them decisively?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget how much strategic material was consumed in the last war to counterattack the Prairie Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kingdom of Light has so little material reserves, what can we use to force them to a decisive battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, we don't have time yet, and the situation on the Western Front may collapse at any time. With the strength of the Principality of Moxi, it can last for two months at most under the attack of the two foreign races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time left for the kingdom shall not exceed three months at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took one month to mobilize the whole country, another month for the army to assemble and rush to the front line, and at least 20 days to return to the western front after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everything goes well, there is only ten days left for the army and the orcs to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to fight this battle? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like I don't know, but I'm taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's sentence \"How to fight this battle\" directly left everyone speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real situation will only be more serious than the theoretical deduction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the data on paper, it is estimated that the current military strength of the kingdom is almost the same as that of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the people present had never led soldiers, they knew a little about military affairs by hearing and seeing, and they knew very well the consequences of a hasty decisive battle with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, the most powerful coach, said no, and the others were even less sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero brought up the problem at this moment, obviously because the nobles in the Northland could not bear the pressure and wanted him to find a solution quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just didn't expect that Hudson not only didn't buy it, but after conducting an in-depth analysis, he directly said: \"How to fight this battle\"?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this question cannot be answered by everyone. If everyone knows how to play, it will not be Hudson's turn to take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the central and southern provinces that are not affected by the war are mainly providing strategic materials to the kingdom. From the perspective of the kingdom, the safety of these provinces is far more important than the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once there are changes in these rear provinces, it will be useless to fight well in northern Xinjiang. For a kingdom that lacks strategic material support, it is only a matter of time before its fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the pressure within the kingdom has always existed. If Hudson hadn't just won a great victory on the Western Front, the internal controversy would have been even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now no one criticizes his strategy. It is because the Western Front is playing too beautifully, and the battle loss ratio is hard to pick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the situation is deteriorating, it is not Hudson's fault. If the performance of the allies is not strong, it is a crime other than war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the royal capital meeting was hurriedly ended, Hudson went straight to the front line. Trying to put pressure on him to change the current strategy is purely overthinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how many opinions the nobles in northern Xinjiang have, they can't change the fact that the orcs came to their doorstep. If you want the main force of the kingdom to gather north, you have to face the dilemma of insufficient strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two unchangeable real problems are superimposed, and many people have begun to suspect that the \"North first, then West strategy\" proposed by Hudson before is purely for the superiors to fool them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doubt is useless. The military's strategic tilt in the north is obvious to all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom spent a lot of money on the defense line. It is obviously not convincing to say that the coach Hudson does not support the northern line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides Hudson, the only person in the know is Caesar IV. It's just that everyone shared the spoils together, and he also played a disgraceful role in the strategic changes of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is deteriorating, so we can only suffer the noble lords in the north first. The risk is directly proportional to the benefit. How much fun it was to expand the enclosure before, and how much risk you have to take now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is stable. Without occupying so much land, the current national defense pressure would not be so great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the Warhammer Great Plains, Hudson led the expeditionary force to march forward in a swaggering manner. The alien troops along the way were fleeing, lest they react slowly and lose their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Battle of Fort Augustus destroyed the arrogance of the allied forces of the ancient survivors, and panic has spread among all the tribes. Especially for those races whose entire army was wiped out on the front line, all the information came from gossip, and the impact was even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of troops have gathered in the province of Deklas, and everyone has a sense of security, but the morale of the army is still not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The common feature of small races is that everyone is close to each other. Either relatives or friends live here, and thousands of children died on the battlefield, and the whole family will be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stabilize the hearts of the people, kings of all races arrived at the front line one after another. More than a hundred race kings, big and small, gathered to form a proper alliance of hundreds of races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The information has been inquired clearly. The enemy claims to have an army of 100,000, but in fact it only has an army of more than 30,000, and the maximum is no more than 40,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race has only such a small force, they dare to run to our territory and shout, and they don't take the alliance at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest that everyone immediately use up all their troops and surround and kill them on the Great Plains of Warhammer, so that the people can know how powerful we are! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king with a loud voice was the first to shout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred between his eyebrows, coupled with his huge figure, looks terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no rush for revenge, the enemies have entered the Great Plains of Warhammer, and they will not run away for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We know too little about the enemy, except for the number of troops and the commander, we know almost nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recklessly engage in a decisive battle, who knows if this is the enemy's conspiracy, don't forget that they are all cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the plains, most of our races cannot outrun the enemy's elite cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that 200,000 are facing more than 30,000 enemy troops. Maybe when it comes to the actual confrontation, the enemy will use high mobility to gain a local advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race has a large population, so it doesn't matter if you lose tens of thousands of troops. But we can't, if we suffer another big defeat, I'm afraid most of the races present will not be able to bear it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the words of the Shadow King, the kings of all clans echoed. Revenge is important, but race continuation is even more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly exchanging sons with the human race, even if they win, it is still a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pain in Fort Augustus has hurt the vitality of many races, and no one wants to come again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then we can't wait forever!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy marched very fast, and there were resistance forces along the way to facilitate them. Judging from the marching route, they obviously wanted to penetrate to the rear of the Southern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy did not stop them, the enemy would enter the Principality of Orton and attack the Southern Expedition Army with the army of the Principality of Moxi. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge must be done with the alliance. Without the help of allies, the thousands of troops of the giant family are not enough to fight the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, kings with different talents like him are very few among the giants, and ordinary giants have the largest number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of strength alone, an ordinary adult giant is comparable to a low-level knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that success is also in shape, and failure is also in body shape. The expeditionary army is equipped with a large number of magic crossbows. These big men with a height of several meters are living targets on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a few powerful giants can rely on their powerful defenses to ignore the enemy's tiny magic crossbow attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, the kings still nodded. The safety of the Southern Expeditionary Corps had to be considered. In case of being flanked by the enemy back and forth, no one could guarantee that the defeat at Fort Augustus would not be repeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is still nearly a thousand miles away from the Principality of Orton. According to their current marching speed, it will take more than ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another 50,000 troops have gathered in the rear, and it is expected that they will join us in five days. Coupled with the troops gathered from all over the country, our total strength will once again exceed 300,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be on the safe side, after gathering an absolute superiority of troops, we will have a decisive battle with the enemy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the Shadow King make a concession, he hesitated a little, and the Giant King nodded slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For things like \"revenge\", the more troops the better. The current enemy is a famous general from the mainland, so we cannot be too cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that deep down in his heart, the giant king always feels that something is wrong, as if something big is about to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army continued to penetrate behind the enemy, and Hudson became more cautious. Not only did they arrange a large number of scouts, but they also asked Bear Stearns to wander around every now and then to see if the enemy's army was moving in this direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the reality is quite the opposite. Not to mention the fact that the main force of the enemy cannot be seen, the enemy is too lazy to even arrange for a small group of troops to harass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do more and make more mistakes, but not doing is good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy stood still, and Hudson was secretly worried. This time he brought all the cavalry, and he was not interested in attacking the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy keeps moving, he really can only lead the army into the Principality of Orton, and flank the opponent's Southern Expedition Army with the Mossi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that in this way, the expeditionary force is also within the enemy's encirclement. If you can't make a breakthrough in a short time, you will also fall into the siege of the enemy on all sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three hundred miles away, the enemy has an army of tens of thousands of people, which is gathering towards the province of Deklas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, are you sure you read it right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance of three hundred miles is already a safe distance for the two armies, but it depends on what army it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary cavalry ran for three hundred miles and could directly lay down their horses, but the expeditionary army was different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Possessing Hastelloy's magic potion, the horse can run three hundred miles, and it can still be alive and well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, do you suspect that Ben Xiong can't count?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Bear Stearns' questioning, Hudson smiled awkwardly. There is no need to worry about the cub's mathematical talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns can understand the account book of \"Bear Castle\", let alone estimate the number of enemy troops.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The current alliance cannot withstand twists and turns. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military command is related to the life and death of the race, and all races will not let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The consequence of independent command is that everyone rushes to get the benefits, and no one is willing to do the hard work and dirty work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a paradox that war is destined to require sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people of insight in the alliance have realized that the organizational structure of the alliance of the ancient survivors cannot meet the needs of reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To truly become a powerful force with the right to speak on the mainland, the only way is for hundreds of clans to unite and work together to build a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedy is: it is useless to realize this, the key is that it cannot be implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are strengths and weaknesses in the alliance of the ancient survivors, no one can coerce the heroes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow Clan is one of the more powerful races, but there are several other races with similar strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are the strengths of the stronger companies similar, but the gap in the strength of the races of the same level has not widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the weakest race, as long as there are a few alliances, they can still compete with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such a background, the Alliance of the Ancient Remained Races naturally had numerous factions and a mixture of fish and dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, you must not give up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know the situation in the alliance. If they are not united, the catastrophe of overthrow is imminent, and the best ending is to become a vassal of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the various races, you are the only one who has great talents, and the rest are...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allen tried his best to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Ancient Survivors finally withdrew from the mainland and returned to the tribal era. Everyone's vision was inevitably bound to the tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Participating in this continental war is the first time they have opened their eyes to see the world in hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then it was embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After consecutive victories, everyone felt that they were invincible; after a big defeat, they suddenly realized that they were nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ambivalence filled the alliance, and many races fell into confusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's hard!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the human race, our races are small tribes. The resources in the hands of a single race can't keep up with a big noble of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a pervert like the Dragon Race, the racial base directly determines the upper limit of development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Placing the various races in the alliance in the human world is only equivalent to their fief viscounts and fief earls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the various ethnic groups are doing their own thing, and each of them is clinging to the old and outdated inheritance. They have hardly introduced the old and brought forth the new, and they have long been unable to keep up with the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the alliance is really united, we are powerless to compete with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, no one in the alliance can command the 200,000 to 300,000 troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was complaining, but his sharp eyes revealed his true thoughts. If he is not going to unify the alliance, why should he study so much?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Verbal denial, that is because the time is not ripe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without absolute strength and lack of sufficient prestige, if you jump out and say unify the alliance, you will be beaten severely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly, the Shadow King had already started planning. Ambition can deceive others, but not those around you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the great cause of the unified alliance cannot be accomplished by one person, and more helpers are needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To engage in such a big plan, one's own family must be more reliable than outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death of Fort Augustus was a heavy blow to the Ancient Alliance, but it was an opportunity for the Shadow Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the name of the race, we can know what the shadow race is good at. Helping the alliance turn defeat into victory is not enough, but it is not difficult to run away to protect itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other races, the Shadow King has a deeper plan. Obviously there was no loss for the family, but when it was announced to the public, it became a heavy loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"killed\" clansmen naturally left the battlefield to prepare for his next plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the autumn wind, the expeditionary army is still moving forward slowly. The only difference is that the route has changed slightly, but the general direction is still the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe deliberately, you will find that the distance between the expeditionary army and the reinforcements of the ancient survivors is getting closer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to cover up the real purpose, the distance between the two sides was not obvious, as if they had caught up by chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two sides is still more than 360 miles, and the shortened distance is only tens of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current route of travel, the two sides will never meet. Even at the nearest place, the distance will not be less than three hundred miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the advance of tens of thousands of cavalry is already shaking the ground, and it is impossible to hide the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent the enemy from discovering the anomaly, Hudson can only do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the entire battlefield, tens of thousands of enemy troops can only be regarded as a side dish, and will not affect the overall battle situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for Hudson, who is eager to find a fighter, small dishes can also serve as a feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the main force of the enemy can be mobilized depends on this wave of actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the weather is a little bit wrong. I'm afraid it will rain next time. Let's find a place to set up camp first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have happened several times along the way. Every time before the weather suddenly changed, Kane would come over to remind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time Hudson suspected that he was practicing astrology and divination, and it turned out that he did.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the heretical occupations marked by the Holy See, fortune tellers in the continent of Aslante have long been a rare species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane also got the introduction to inheritance cultivation by accident when he was young, but unfortunately his leader was killed by the Holy See, and he failed to learn everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging the weather is okay, divination of the future is beyond the scope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heretic life is not easy. Kane, who was born in a minor noble, has been hiding his identity and avoiding the Holy See as much as possible on weekdays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory is a newly developed territory, the influence of the church is negligible, and Hudson's name is famous enough, so he took advantage of the trend and defected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through a long period of contact, he found that his lord had conflicts with the Holy See, and after confirming that he would not hand over himself to the Holy See, Kane stayed at ease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, he hid his identity, but after he found out that not only his own lord was rebellious, but also the entire Alpha Kingdom's high-level executives were rebellious, Kane didn't bother to hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar heretics, there are many mountain leaders. Especially after Hudson became the honorary dean of the Arcane Academy, more heretic professionals gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If others dare to come, Hudson dares to accept. He didn't care if he was a heretic, as long as he wasn't a scum of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, in ancient times, when the human race was in decline, these were all serious occupations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous rise of the human race and the expansion of the Holy See, these occupations that are not conducive to the spread of beliefs were classified as heresies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are more interest games hidden behind this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson understands this kind of change very well. The cake is made, so the fewer people who share it, the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is in the past tense, now is a new era, and we must look forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to go down, speed up the march, and set up camp on the hill ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drought is not a good choice, even if everyone is in good health and can handle it. The materials carried with the army cannot withstand the damage of the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This **** weather, it's almost impossible to let the giant live!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing a group of allies hiding in the camp to avoid the rain, but he could only get out in the rain with his clansmen, Kavehe was so envious and jealous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the size of the giants is too huge, and the tents seized from the human race simply cannot accommodate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of tarpaulins were seized, but judging from the size of the giants, they had nothing to do with dexterity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giants have long been used to the days of eating and sleeping in the open. Except for a few natural caves for them to rest in, they spend most of their time in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant who can't bear it has long been eliminated by nature. Because they live in the world of ice and snow, they also have a famous name in the outside world - Frost Giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because they have \"Frost\" in their name doesn't mean they like this kind of ghost weather. The result of years of battling against inclement weather: Giants, more than any other race, long for the land in the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kaveh, stop your loud voice. You giants don't rest, we still have to rest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A voice came from the camp, and Kavehe stomped his feet angrily. Dare to provoke an angry giant at such a time, if he hadn't taken into account the influence of the covenant, he would definitely have gone to find the other party to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pamela, take a rest! Hurry up and put me on duty. Today, you are responsible for patrolling and guarding. If the enemy comes to sneak attack, your crime will be serious.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if there are enemies coming to attack him. Anyway, the palpable “happiness” of being in the rain cannot be tolerated by the giants. He must be backed a bit, otherwise he will be psychologically unbalanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kaveh, you are such an idiot, you have such a big head for nothing, you can't even figure out such a simple question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are in the rear, where are the enemies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The closest enemy to this place is three or four hundred miles away, and with the blessing of heavy rain, there is no surprise attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you are confused by the rain, and even the most basic military common sense has been forgotten. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pamela said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to steal a camp, you must also consider the actual situation, and it cannot be done with a slap in the head. Marching three or four hundred miles on a rainy night to carry out a surprise attack is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The muddy road will limit the mobility of the cavalry. If there is a battle in the rain, it will be more beneficial to the infantry who are not very mobile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing, who knows?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the enemy commander has his mind full of water, he chooses to sneak attack at this time. If you don't go out to patrol, the troops will waste their fighters in vain. It will be enough for you to ask the blame later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh stubbornly argued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing is not losing. I agree with Pamela's judgment in my heart, but it's about my own face, and I must not admit defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quarrel between the two has attracted countless people who eat melons. Some powerhouses even stepped out of the hood and set up magic shields to keep out the rain, just to watch the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that if he continued to quarrel, he would become a joke, Kaveh turned his head and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raindrops kept falling, and Hudson nestled in the tent and cried out secretly. After finally finding a chance to attack, it was actually destroyed by a heavy rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running hundreds of miles overnight to launch a sneak attack, Hudson dares to fight such a battle, but rushing hundreds of miles under heavy rain, so save it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't wait for the horses to be ruined by the quagmire before they reach their destination. Hudson is not interested in fighting such an unreliable battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, it has been raining heavily for two hours, and it seems that it won't stop for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the guide, it is now the rainy season. According to past patterns, this kind of weather usually lasts for as short as a few days and as long as more than a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was delayed by the heavy rain, and our original plan may not be able to continue. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said frowningly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the first time he gave advice to the coach, and he encountered such a ghostly weather that he almost suspected that he was possessed by the **** of decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem in the rainy season is not the torrential rain, but the muddy roads. Even if the sky cleared in the middle, it would still be difficult for the army to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before making the plan, he didn't take the weather into consideration. Obviously, he was unqualified as a counselor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, this kind of thing is not to blame for you. I thought that this year's Warhammer Great Plains will be dry and rainless, and there will be no rainy season. I didn't expect it to catch up at the last moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is no one to harvest the crops in the field, and now they can only be wasted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's just wait, fighter planes will appear sooner or later. Now the Lord of Dawn does not bless us, and we cannot do what God can do. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of the rainy season delayed the movement of the army, and also saved him a lot of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the mighty power of nature and the insignificance of manpower, the country can no longer urge him to make a quick decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resurgence of the war in the northern borders, and the fact that the kingdom's strategy of first going north and then going west was forced to shelve, and now some people are helping to carry it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the follow-up war, it's better to take one step at a time. Hudson didn't believe it, and couldn't find the enemy's flaws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rainy season is unusual. It rained intermittently for seven days in a row before a rainbow appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rain, the sky clears up, but I don't know whether this sunny day is permanent or just a flash in the pan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Touring the camp every day, Hudson has long been bored. Fortunately, the coverage of the rain was wide enough, and it didn't just catch the expeditionary army's family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by heavy rainfall, flash floods occurred in many areas. Unfortunately, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors gathered in the province of Deklas caught up with a wave of mountain torrents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers who had been in the camp all day in such heavy rainy weather were full of anger. It happened to be a mountain torrent, so it's no wonder the morale was high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who received the news, was not only fortunate, but also fortunate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, I chose to camp on a higher mountain. If I chose to camp in a flat area for convenience, how to drain the water in the camp would be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking into the distance, Hudson ordered to the guards: \"Send down the order and summon the officers above the regiment level of the Warcraft Cavalry Legion to discuss matters!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a regiment-level officer, and the regiment level in the Warcraft Cavalry Legion is obviously much higher than that in other legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling them over for a meeting alone is not class discrimination. The main reason is that the roads are now muddy, which limits the performance of ordinary cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the impact on Warcraft is much smaller, almost negligible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the only force Hudson can use is the five thousand monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally during the rainy period, Hudson was going to take this monster cavalry out to do things, and caught the enemy by surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in consideration of the limited force, it is impossible to do big things, and it is not worth exposing the combat effectiveness of the Warcraft cavalry in advance, so they chose to temporarily shelve the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rain, everyone is in a good mood, and it is also the time when it is most likely to be negligent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seven days of stability, coupled with the muddy road, is enough to dispel the vigilance of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the top of the head, you can tell that in the past few days, the enemy has not come to reconnaissance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not because of negligence, but pure unnecessaryness. The advantage of cavalry lies in mobility, and it is impossible to give up their advantages and run to fight fortified battles in camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to win at the lowest cost, you must launch an attack when the enemy is in motion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

We were delayed by the heavy rain for such a long time, and the army was about to run out of food. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing \"no food\", Kaweihe jumped up all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the size, you can tell that giants must be big eaters. If the nutrition can't keep up, I can't grow such a big man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past in the world of ice and snow, the biggest pain for the giant family was starvation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do not engage in agricultural production, but rely entirely on hunting for a living. The backward production mode determines that the giants can only live in small tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually, there are no more than three hundred giants in a giant tribe. Otherwise, there will not be enough prey nearby for everyone to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food acquisition mode centered on hunting is very unstable. In this context, starvation has become the norm for giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pamela, what are you talking about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No food, impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many carts of food, how could it be gone so quickly? Could it be that you have withheld our military rations? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long-starved race, food is life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Kaveh's unfriendly gaze, Pamela took three steps back, calmed down and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What the hell!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why food is consumed so quickly, don't you know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food intake of Kaweihe alone is dozens of times that of mine. With more of you big stomach kings, can food consumption not be fast! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the leader of the giant army, Kavehe's size is also outstanding among the giants, and the corresponding food demand is also greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The consumption of ordinary giants is relatively small, which is only relative to him. Compared with soldiers of other races, they are still big eaters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the outbreak of the Continental War, giants starved every now and then. After finally having the opportunity to open their stomachs to eat, everyone will naturally not keep it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giants need to use pots for cooking, and a meal of dozens of pounds of food is easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such a group of big eaters, food consumption will naturally not be slowed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, this time they came out to reinforce the coalition forces in the province of Deklas. If there was no rainy season, they would have arrived at their destination by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe because he knew he was wrong, Kavehe suddenly became embarrassed, and said hesitantly: \"The next meal is a big deal. I will eat less, but we can't deduct our military rations!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, the generals of various ethnic groups who came together had black lines on their foreheads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, discussing with the big guy is a waste of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that there are more than 800 giants in the reinforcements this time, but with a proper combat power, everyone would be too lazy to talk to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, no one will deduct your military rations, but in order to make up for the lack of supplies, we must take a military action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way here, we found traces of armed resistance activities nearby, there should be…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Pamela finished speaking, the ground suddenly shook, as if an earthquake had erupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enemy attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the spies sent back the information, a large army appeared in the sky, and it was before everyone's eyes in a blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the enemy's arrival is really too fast, faster than the horse scouts arranged by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Arrange to meet the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pamela hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of commanders returned to their camp one after another, organized the army to prepare for the battle, and the whole camp was chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giants outside the camp are the most miserable, and they are about to be caught between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the murderous monster cavalry in front of him, Kavehe said decisively: \"What are you doing in a daze, get out of here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he had already turned around and left the spot, directly detouring from the flank to the rear of the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden show operation directly stupefied the coalition forces of all ethnic groups in the camp. Stupid big giants, giants will also run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the giant human shield, the camp was suddenly exposed to the expeditionary force, making Hudson wonder if it was an enemy conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the big camp ahead has neither a horse trap nor a horse rejection post, and it is completely undefended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a large capital, it would be too generous to play conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the hurriedly lined up enemy troops, Hudson smiled disdainfully, and immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The magic crossbow shoots freely, rushing into the camp to defeat the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He finally understood that the enemy army was tricked by \"our own people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally there were giants guarding the periphery, even if they encountered enemy attacks, there was enough time to gather troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan couldn't keep up with the changes. The giant guarding the gate of the camp was frightened by the army of monsters and stepped aside to open the gate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of crossbow arrows piercing through the air directly pierced the camp. The coalition soldiers standing in front were killed and injured in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Counterattack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archers counterattack quickly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pamela roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything is in vain. The archer and the magic crossbow shoot at each other. The gap between the two sides is an era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless well-trained archers fell directly under the random shots of the magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the towering archery tower had time to display its power, it was slapped down by Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as the magicians in the camp were about to make a move, Maxim's spit out a big fireball and swept towards them, scaring everyone to dodge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who survived the catastrophe were still in shock, and the unlucky ones who reacted a little slower turned into people on fire with only one scream left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big fireball seemed to have life, and it didn't go out immediately. Instead, it rolled towards the depths of the camp. The tents, food and grass along the way were burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One of the few masters in the coalition forces wanted to come out to intercept, but was immediately shot by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he set off on the expedition, he made a special trip to the Arcane Academy and asked those old antiques to help him build a magic bow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power is very powerful. The only problem is that it consumes too much. It consumes a seventh-level wood-type magic core once it is activated, and it cannot be replaced by a low-level one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are few wood-type monsters, let alone seventh-level monsters. If it is in the hands of others, this is a tasteless magic weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, wood magicians of the eighth level and above can also drive, but they are almost sucked dry after releasing an arrow, and the power is similar to that of their full-strength release of magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to be able to drive, but it is another thing to be able to draw the bow and hit the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few people who cultivate both magic and martial arts, but almost none of them have achieved higher results at the same time. Human energy is limited, so we must make choices in cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few arrows of \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\" were shot, reminding the foreign race that Master Hudson also has the reputation of \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong are not easy to kill. Except for the initial sneak attack, most of the rest are only scratched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It made Hudson very depressed, and he had to sigh that giants are easy to kill, and that kind of big guy can aim at every target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the army had rushed into the camp, and the coalition forces fighting on their own suffered a big loss immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As neighbors of giants, the multi-clawed tribe suffered the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the chaotic camp, Pamela was about to greet the eighteenth generation of Kavehe's ancestors, when she was swept by a dragon's tail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then the scene completely got out of control, and the multi-claw soldiers who lost their command wanted their parents to have two more legs and fled in all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of routs rushed to the rear, directly disrupting the formation of the rear army, and before they could react, the enemy had already killed them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rout, hit the rear camp again; Rout again, hit again...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continued behavior of pig teammates made the expeditionary force, which was at a disadvantage in terms of strength, gain an advantage in strength when fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition camp that stretched for seven or eight miles became a mess. The race, unable to bear the pressure, left the camp involuntarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, we seem to have gotten into trouble?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the question from the giant beside him, Kaveh slapped him on the back of the head, and said angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Aren't you talking nonsense!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that they are experienced in such things as causing trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the situation is a little different this time, and it seems that the allies have been miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking of the last time in Fort Augustus, the entire army of his own army was wiped out, and Kaveh felt a little bit more confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, what should we do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little brother who had been slapped stretched out his hand and rubbed the back of his head, as if nothing happened, and continued to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it wasn't the first time he was beaten, he was used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Teaching the younger brother can be done at any time, but dealing with the aftermath is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing the troops over to help, it seems that the risk is a bit high, and it may accidentally injure one's own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Second brother, how about we go around and attack the enemy back and forth?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He fights often, but this is the first time he fights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all reinforcements drawn from the rear. The biggest scene they experienced was a group of 180 giants fighting in groups, or hunting a large monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Inappropriate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wang said that you need to use your brains in battle, and you can't charge stupidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You see there are deserters, and the alliance has deserters—kill!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, we can persuade the deserters to go back, so as to save them from losing their heads, which can be regarded as helping our allies. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Kaveh still nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what I should do now, I have to try my best to make up for my mistakes, and I can't just stay where I am.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the team all the way through the camp, Hudson discovered that something was wrong, and brought the enemy troops who should have fled in all directions together again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the scene wasn't too chaotic, he would have suspected that the enemy army had a general, and gathered his troops to counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim took off, I want to see what happened on the battlefield!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was dumbfounded by the scene in front of him. A group of giants scattered around the camp, constantly persuading the defeated soldiers to return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way of persuading him to return is very characteristic of giants. Either return to the camp obediently, or be smashed into a pulp by the giant's sledgehammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are several alien races in the distance who are confronting the giant leader. What is the content of the quarrel, Hudson does not know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the scene was very tense. At one point, Hudson suspected that the enemy army had a unified command, and the giant was a supervisory team sent by the enemy's coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what the truth is. The key is that the enemy army was blocked in the camp and did not flee in all directions. This is very different from his plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rabbits bite people when they are in a hurry, let alone a coalition of 50,000 ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary army was able to kill all directions. On the one hand, the combat effectiveness of the monster cavalry was really strong, and on the other hand, it caught the opponent by surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy rain for seven consecutive days has already made the coalition forces lower their vigilance. Even the soldiers sent out on patrol only wandered around for a few miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the expeditionary army was discovered, the distance between the two sides was only a few miles. The information was passed back, and the monster cavalry also rushed to the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many soldiers were forced to take up arms to meet the enemy before they had time to put on their armor, and tragedy became inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But no matter what, that was 50,000 enemy troops, fully ten times the strength of the Warcraft Legion, and they could still bring a lot of casualties to the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Put down your weapons, surrender without killing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson spoke in the lingua franca of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the blessing of amplification magic, the sound was transmitted to the ears of all soldiers on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although many foreign soldiers did not understand what he said, they could roughly tell from the expressions of their own officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"boom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of weapons falling broke the silence. As soon as the first soldier who could not bear the pressure lowered his weapon, the wave of surrender began to spread rapidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong, Kaveh immediately shouted: \"These **** traitors dare to surrender to the enemy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are you still doing in a daze, run away! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the voice fell to the ground, Kavehe had turned and left, followed by all the giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the entire army was annihilated last time, the giant king has specifically instructed that if you can't win, you should focus on preserving your own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh undoubtedly fulfilled his boss's instructions and ran at the forefront of the team with an unscathed army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, several foreign generals who were confronting Kaveh almost vomited blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the huge gap between the giants and the human race, they would have suspected that these guys were traitors planted by the enemy, and they would do a lot of tricks on their teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road is out of the way, so there is no need to fight the enemy to the end. As for surrender, that is the last option.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the enemy leave the camp, Hudson slowly ordered the pursuit. Compared with fighting on the frontal battlefield, the pursuit after a defeat is the easiest time to achieve results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quickly hit hard, completely unnecessary. Hanging the enemy like this is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the enemy's air force went out to ask for help, he didn't stop him, and now he would not be in a hurry to annihilate the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Declas Province, affected by the flash floods, the coalition forces were forced to move, and the camp is still in chaos at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I just said, you can't be greedy for comfort, but you just don't listen. You must feel the disadvantages of building camps based on water, now you can feel it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three-headed monster's chattering complaints immediately aroused the anger of the evil-eyed king, who immediately retorted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three-headed king, don't make sarcastic remarks there, the establishment of camps based on water is not for the convenience of everyone to get water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are so many of us, if we don't build the camp by the river, where can we find such a large open space?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the current camp is, it is crowded with tents connected to tents. If it is attacked by enemy fire, the camp will be reduced to ashes in an instant! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"And, still stubborn...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more races and more right and wrong, similar bickering activities are commonplace in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Races that were hostile in the past, now meet with a few words of irony. It is impossible to dissuade them, because any race among the hundreds of ancient races has more than one family of enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher-ups are bickering, and the people below are not idle. If the kings of various clans hadn't forcibly suppressed it, I'm afraid the clansmen below would have done it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of rhetoric is not completely useless. With more foreign races pulling hatred, the internal conflicts of various races have eased down for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original conflicts between neighboring tribes became insignificant overnight, and all tribes were fighting against each other against each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that it is entirely feasible to use external enemies to divert internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is counting on using the great enemy of the human race to ease the internal conflicts among the various races in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King, something is wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 50,000 troops who came for reinforcements were attacked by the main force of the enemy at a distance of two hundred miles from the camp of the coalition forces and suffered heavy losses. They urgently needed reinforcements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, the soldier who came back to report passed out. It made everyone feel anxious, and it was too late to ask for details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shocked by the bad news, the quarreling kings also fell silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the rain stopped, the enemy dared to step on the muddy road to steal the camp, which was really unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone was hesitating, the Shadow King first proposed: \"King Snow Eagle, your clan is the fastest, please arrange for your clan to find out what happened on the front line as soon as possible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be idle, everyone, go back and prepare for battle immediately. The enemy is cavalry, and the muddy road is their worst enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you grasp it well, you may be able to severely damage the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Snow Eagle King, who was reminded, immediately reacted and replied directly: \"It should be so, I will arrange it now.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the alliance of the ancient survivors, the Snow Eagle clan is at the bottom in terms of the number of members and the strength of the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason why they can have a high status in the alliance is that they can fly and undertake the task of transmitting messages from the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bad news always comes one after another. Just as the Snow Eagle King was about to leave, another Snow Eagle flew over unsteadily, glanced at the kings, and said tremblingly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The reinforcements were attacked by the enemy, and they were caught off guard and unfortunately defeated. The army is moving here. Please send reinforcements to meet...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, he fainted gorgeously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene made Snow Eagle King very embarrassed. Ordinary Snow Eagles have a limited flying distance, but the elites in Snow Eagles are responsible for transmitting messages. Why are there two couriers in a row, they are all these useless guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this moment, the eyes of the kings are no longer on him, and they are all thinking about rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impatient giant king broke the silence first: \"Why are you hesitating, our team has suffered a defeat and is being hunted down by the enemy army, so send reinforcements to help!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemies are all cavalry, even if the muddy road restricts mobility, they will not be slower than infantry. If you go late, I'm afraid you can only collect the corpse for the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family backgrounds of our races are not strong. If we lose the 50,000 troops, the next battle will be even more difficult. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the words are rough, the truth is completely fine. There is a limit on the number of clansmen, and the Ancient Remnant Clan Alliance cannot sit back and watch the 50,000 army be wiped out by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other kings, the Giant King is obviously more worried. With the lessons learned from the last time, he was very worried that his family members would not react fast enough, and he would be the queen of the army again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it's useless to worry. The giants have the strength increase brought by their size, so they have to accept the disadvantage of being bigger and more attractive to the enemy's firepower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no time to delay, all ethnic groups will first mobilize their elites, organize a rescue brigade, and go to bring the troops back first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what happened on the front line, we still need to find out as soon as possible. You can't just go and get confused if you don't know anything! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King said decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just now I saw the giant running wildly, as if being chased and killed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taylor hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is small to be scolded, but he dare not bear the charge of wanting to kill everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The giant is running for his life?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are you kidding me, the entire Warhammer Kingdom is now the territory of alien races, even if there are still troops left behind, they are still cautious, who dares to hunt down a group of giants?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you were probably frightened, so the phantom appeared...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, the old man stopped suddenly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Looking at the movement, it should be a large army moving. The footsteps are too scattered and compact, not like marching, but more like running for their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Something seems wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulty The Ancient Remnants Alliance has internal strife, and is killing each other at the moment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Impossible, the enemy should not be so stupid. At least they won't be willful until they defeat us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You stay inside, I will find a chance to go out and have a look. Maybe in recent days, the outside situation has changed again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of adversity, the main reason why everyone can persevere is because everyone believes that the human army will fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race has been the overlord of the mainland for so many years, and it has also cultivated its own arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter orcs, elves, such powerful alien races, everyone may feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Alliance of Ancient Remnants, these declining races that have been suppressed by the Warhammer Kingdom for countless years, they still have confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Third Uncle, if you don't go out after dark, it's been raining heavily outside, and it's easy to leave footprints.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taylor persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man is the backbone of everyone. If an accident happens when they go out, it may be difficult for their small group to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I'm a Tier 5 thief, as long as I'm careful, I'll be fine.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, the old man patted Taylor on the shoulder, turned around and went to the vent left in advance to observe the outside situation, and only after making sure that there was no danger nearby, stepped out of the cave carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After using the stealth technique all the way and choosing a hidden bush to take shelter, the old man quickly looked around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him took him by surprise. The giants were not the only ones crazily fleeing for their lives, and no less than twenty races passed by him in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of routs are clearly a sign of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The human army has come back?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a little fast. With the situation in the northern continent, countries should not have time to send troops to regain the homeland of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking hesitantly at the scene in front of him, the old man hid himself more and more tightly, lest his whereabouts be revealed and he would be killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For several hours in a row, there were broken soldiers passing by in front of him, and the scalp of the old man was numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is tens of thousands of defeated soldiers, and it is absolutely impossible for the remaining resistance forces to defeat them. There must be a large army of human beings nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suppressing his curiosity, the old man continued to lurk in the bushes until the flag rising from the sky caught his attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The dragon and the bear of the earth, this is the battle flag of the dragon and bear. Marshal Hudson is here. Could it be that the era of the big counterattack has come earlier!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to wait for this day, he has been suffering for several months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the night was quiet, he couldn't help but wonder if his choice was wrong. It was the best choice to bring his clansmen to join the refugee team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just thinking about the young and old in the clan, he couldn't bear it after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, as a fifth-tier thief, he can leave at any time if he is not dragged down by his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Ancient Survivors only seized the city, but their actual control over the place is still minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The immigrants of all ethnic groups have not yet arrived, as long as they avoid the enemy's army, they can leave this land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing a monster cavalry coming, in order to avoid misunderstanding, the old man hastily identified himself and said, \"Don't do anything, it's one of our own!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some simple communication, the identity verification was carried out, and finally the team guide +1.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes have happened many times along the way, and the officers below can handle it by themselves, and there is no need for the coach Hudson to worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher the quality of the army, the easier it is to lead, and the Warcraft Legion is undoubtedly the pinnacle of this era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can become monster cavalry are all the children of nobles, and the lowest strength is knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The advantages of high quality can be best reflected in local operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking this pursuit of the enemy as an example, everyone has successfully completed the task assigned by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy troops that were supposed to flee in all directions after being defeated were all heading north at this moment. It wasn't that they wanted to run this way, but they were forced to flee north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only hordes of rout soldiers are worth rescuing. If the enemy flees in all directions, you don't know where to start if you want to rescue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to lure the enemy, the enemy carried out reconnaissance from the air, and Hudson generously let them play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bait has been put down. If you want rescue, send troops quickly. If you don't come, just wait for the whole army to be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, if the current situation continues, at most three days later, the fleeing enemy army will collide with 30,000 cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The muddy road is indeed not suitable for cavalry, but if there are no such disadvantages, the enemy will not be hooked!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, there is news from the Griffin Dragoons that the enemy's enlarged army has moved!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson smiled slightly, and immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army camps and rests on the spot, and chases the enemy tomorrow!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how the enemy came and how many reinforcements they sent, as long as they left the province of Deklas, the strategy of luring the enemy would be successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry is best at fighting mobile warfare. Don't be afraid of the enemy's menacing attack, but be afraid that the enemy's army will not move. A tortoise shell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is good news from the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yesterday, the Warcraft Legion under the command of the Expeditionary Army defeated the 50,000 army of the Ancient Remnant Alliance in the Crote area of ​​the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the expeditionary force is encircling and suppressing the defeated soldiers, and the specific record is still being counted. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins reported happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the previous record of defeating 300,000 enemy troops, this victory seems nothing, but looking at the entire northern continent battlefield, this is also a first-class record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the start of the war, it is not that the countries of the Northern Continent have not won victories, but behind every victory they have paid heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in the two major victories of the expeditionary force, the losses of our own side were minimal, as if we were not facing the same enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems. Anyway, the Alpha Kingdom has always been the most powerful country in the Northern Continent, and its commander Hudson is also the number one general in the Northern Continent. After a while, everyone will get used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is an ally, no matter who wins the battle, it is good news for the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the principality's army did not participate, and missed an opportunity to build a record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are greedy for military merit. Everyone in the hall is the pillar of the Moxi Principality, and they don't lack that little military merit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is international status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Powerful countries are all created by fighting. Take the Alpha Kingdom as an example. Even if they suffered heavy losses in the war, no one dared to treat them as soft persimmons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This just came out, and the good news on the battlefield once again pushed the prestige of the Alpha Kingdom to its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stepping stones are not only the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants, but also the countries of the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The illusory reputation seems to be just a false name, but it is actually the basis for re-dividing interests after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan of the Principality of Moxi is very simple. If you can't defeat the enemy by yourself, then follow the Alpha Kingdom to win the record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have no chance of being the number one country in the Northern Continent, but the name of the number two country is not bad either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Focus on the sense of presence, and when the interests are re-divided after the war, it is completely possible to bite off a piece of meat from the homeland of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone must have ideals. Even in adversity, it cannot affect their dream of a great country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let Raquel lead eighteen legions into the Kingdom of Warhammer, and follow the orders of Marshal Hudson to fight.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George ordered without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know Hudson's follow-up battle plan, some preparations must be made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the frontline battle goes well and defeats the coalition forces of the ancient survivors in one fell swoop, the army of the Principality must be present in the battle to regain the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to go out and grab the land. This time he bought Caesar IV and Hudson, but he paid a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees are just the deposit paid earlier, and we haven't discussed the final payment in detail yet!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is just population, it is naturally no problem to use it to buy aristocratic lords like Hudson who are seriously short of people in their territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV, who had a great family and a great career, was not so shallow-sighted. If there is a real shortage of labor, it is not difficult to solve it with the network of contacts owned by the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When interests are involved, relatives have to settle accounts clearly. The previously promised benefits + favors are limited to sending troops to reinforce the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi wants the cooperation of the Alpha Kingdom to seek greater benefits after the war, additional money must be added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to expand in the continent of Aslant, the biggest problem is the rule of law. This time the alien race is raging, in fact, it is clearing away the legal obstacles to expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fallen Warhammer Kingdom, in a sense, can also be regarded as a land of no man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not realistic to swallow them all, but it is still possible to collect a lot of money from them under the banner of supporting the restoration of the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Restoration of the country has the greatest impact on geopolitics. Among the members of the Warhammer royal family who escaped by chance, whoever bids higher and who has no bottom line will be the future king of the East and West Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the food looks a little ugly, it is also feasible to create four or five heirs and further split the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these plans are all based on the fact that the human race has won a complete victory. If the continental war fails, everything will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, this kind of thought came into being, mainly because of the victory of the expeditionary force, which brought confidence to George.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the elf army is attacking very fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the fall of the Principality of Kantruo, the capital of the Principality of Ustad has just fallen, and has now withdrawn to the mountains to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Principality of Fick is also very dangerous, and it is only a matter of time before it falls. The three principalities have fallen, and we will immediately face the army of elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, a large number of troops are being deployed into the Warhammer Kingdom, which may affect the next battle. Better to ask Marshal Hudson first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins tactfully persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tension in the battle is one aspect. The key lies in the fact that the elite of the Principality of Moxi are all devoted to the battlefield of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of Moxi's reinforcements, the Principality of Orton would have collapsed long ago, and it is impossible to sustain it until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army remaining in the country is either newly mobilized recruits, or allies gathered from the refugee ranks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These legions have only completed basic military training, and they can barely make do with defending the city. Sending them to the front line to participate in the battle is purely make up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Minister of Military Affairs, Earl Martins cannot directly say that his army is trash, but can only tactfully oppose sending troops to the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, George nodded. Politically, it is necessary to send troops to the Warhammer Kingdom, but military factors must also be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose of sending troops in the past is to follow the wind and gain a sense of presence in the process of regaining lost ground, not to kill the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accidentally lose a battle on the front line because of your lack of strength, it will be a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the elf army camp, the triumphant progress along the way did not make the three elf queens happy, but gave birth to countless sorrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eldest sister, those guys from the ancient survivors are really useless, and they have suffered another defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that several human nations in the Northern Continent had their own ideas and didn't send troops immediately, I'm afraid they would have been defeated by others long ago! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grassland elf queen couldn't help but complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first time I suffered a loss, it can be said that I encountered a surprise attack from the enemy; the second time I was defeated, the enemy army attacked the camp head-on in broad daylight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no excuse to find, that is, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors are too useless, they can only bully soft persimmons, and they will show their true colors when they meet the elite of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Second sister, this human army sent by the Alpha Kingdom is not an ordinary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the Alliance of Ancient Survivors, the 5,000 enemy troops who launched the attack were all monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, all human countries have vigorously developed the Warcraft Legion. This army should be the result of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combat strength We have seen that 5,000 monster cavalry attacked the camp of the 50,000 army of the ancient remnant allied forces head-on, and quickly won an overwhelming victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information we have obtained before, the combat effectiveness of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors is actually not bad. The main reason is that there are certain problems in the internal command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the defensive side, the command requirements were greatly reduced, and it was still a crushing defeat. This is by no means an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the combat power of the Alpha people, the Warcraft Legion, is one of the few elites in our clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the power of the Alpha Kingdom, there are several similar big countries in the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Alpha Kingdom, which has been consumed by orcs all year round, these countries can devote more resources to the Warcraft Legion. The number of Warcraft cavalry in his hands must be much more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the top forces of the human race like the Holy See, the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia, there are probably tens of thousands of monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number is still just the beginning. With the passage of time, the later major human nations will gradually catch up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Kantruo, Ustad, and Fick, the three small countries that have been suppressed by us all the year round, can gather thousands of monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that their monster army started too late, most of the monsters are still in the growth stage, and it is definitely not so easy to be wiped out by us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, the large-scale use of magic crossbows is also very detrimental to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even for the best archers, it is difficult to take advantage of a group of guys holding magic crossbows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the human race is expanding too fast, especially in the use of emerging equipment, and it is at the forefront of the mainland! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Forest Elf Queen couldn't help but sigh with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things cannot be envied. The core factor for the human race to vigorously develop the Warcraft Legion and Magic Crossbow is that as the overlord of the mainland, they have enough resources in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all races push forward with all their strength, they will eventually lag behind the human race due to insufficient resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the easiest way to change a person. They originally thought that \"the elves don't need so many resources\", but now that the war has progressed, they suddenly discovered that the elves also need resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Warcraft Legion is powerful, but the cost of raising it is also high. The daily consumption of just one Warcraft can keep up with twenty or thirty ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building a magic crossbow also requires a lot of resources. In the era of pure handmade, high loss in the process of processing is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sister, do you mean that we also develop the Warcraft Legion and produce a large number of magic crossbows?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night elf queen asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long-lived race has a wealth of experience, but it is inevitable that they will be slow to respond when encountering new affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Habits formed in the past have become the biggest enemy of technological change. Even if they saw the big move of the human race, the elves did not follow up immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's discuss these issues after the war! The most urgent thing is to speed up. We must get rid of the stumbling blocks in the road and severely damage the Principality of Moxi before the coalition forces of the ancient survivors are defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best to destroy the expeditionary army sent by the Alpha Kingdom on the battlefield together to clear the way for the south! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elf queen said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worry is mutual. The Alpha Kingdom was worried that after the army of the elves wiped out the countries in the Northern Continent, they also packed themselves up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are not worried. After the army went south, the Alpha Kingdom suddenly sent troops to cut off the return of its own army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very simple to eliminate hidden dangers, that is, to severely damage the Alpha Kingdom in advance, and kill potential threats in the cradle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even more perfect if the North Continent could be included in the bag on the premise of successfully rescuing the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land is too much to control, so let it be abandoned to raise monsters. On the issue of harmonious coexistence between man and nature, the performance of the elves is perfect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true to create an army of monsters, with the talent of being close to nature, the probability of elves being recognized by monsters is much higher than that of humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many elves with monsters. That's because these guys are full of arrogance and have no interest in low-level monsters. They only have mid-level and high-level monsters in their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The previous military deployment now needs to be fully adjusted. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was the first time he was making a military plan, and this kind of accident happened, and he was under a lot of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategizing and winning thousands of miles away is just a beautiful fantasy after all. In a real war, all kinds of accidents may happen at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like this time, the expeditionary army wants to use the bait in their hands to lure the enemy to divide their troops to come to the rescue, and first let the enemy army bleed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the impact is not very big. As long as the enemy moves, our plan will be half successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal that there is no division of troops for rescue.

There are so many people in the Ancient Remnants Alliance, there will always be someone who can think of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military deployment does need to be adjusted, but the overall change is not big. The fish are all hooked, and the bait is of little use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to let the 30,000 cavalry take care of the progress, wait until the day after tomorrow at noon when the army pinches the enemy back and forth, and eat the bait first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to defeat 50,000 enemy troops is a **** profit. What's more, it also led the enemy's main force to the plain area, which cannot be regarded as a failure no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The muddy road will indeed restrict the mobility of the cavalry, but it will also affect the actions of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, enemies like the Alliance of Ancient Remains are the most difficult to calculate, and the best to calculate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a large group of people in power, and with a word from you and me, you can make up all kinds of possibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing the truth does not mean being able to grasp it. If you avoid this pit, you will step into another pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance has many flaws, but its advantages are not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of small clans on the verge of destruction to rely on an alliance to become a big force, it is a remarkable achievement in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of military strength, the Alliance of Ancient Remains is actually not weak. Once the internal integration is completed, it is very likely to become the next orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this scene happens, it will not be long before the human race loses the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this expedition, in addition to rescuing the Duke of Moxi, Hudson also brought the kingdom's strategic purpose - to severely damage or divide the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is advancing, but the atmosphere inside the Alliance of Ancient Remnants is very strange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king with a loud voice in the past, now looks like a child who has made a mistake, bowing his head and saying nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened on the front line has already been passed on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 50,000 coalition army was defeated, and the giant family should bear at least half of the responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't let go of the door, the expeditionary force would not have been able to \"horse step joint camp\" so smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, the Giant King had already scolded Kavehe bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with wanting to preserve your strength, at least you have to resist symbolically, and then run away with the team!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this situation, the responsibility for the defeat of the 50,000 coalition army naturally fell on the giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more no one speaks, the bigger the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the expressions of the kings, it can be seen that everyone is also very embarrassed now, and they don't know how to deal with the matter in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kill chickens to warn monkeys\", execute giant deserters?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those guys who are also running away can only come back alive from the butcher knife of the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in the last battle of Fort Augustus, everyone was making peace and did not seriously deal with the issue of deserters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is a sudden and severe punishment, the giants will definitely not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many kings, what happened this time was purely the giants deliberately venting their inner dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more questions you think about, the more difficult it will be for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When this happened, the biggest problem was the lack of strict military discipline. To prevent similar incidents from happening, it is imperative to clean up military discipline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What should be held accountable, what should be dealt with, the alliance cannot continue to be so chaotic! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King said coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It could be seen that he was really **** off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A farce that led to the defeat of the 50,000 army was undoubtedly disastrous for the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allies are no longer trustworthy, so how will the follow-up battle be fought?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is okay to be held accountable, but it must be fair.

The total population of the giant clan was only that small, and the reinforcements of several hundred giants accounted for one-tenth of their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, he had to find a way to keep it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Responsibility cannot be shirked, and now he can only talk about \"fairness\" in order to win the support of the kings of all races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the weaker races, they are already in a weak position in the alliance, so they need fairness even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst scene finally happened. Hudson didn't even have time to provoke, and the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants first triggered an internal crisis of trust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all are dealt with seriously according to the requirements of the giant king, there will be more races involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deserters are in no particular order. The first deserter is a deserter, and the 10,000th deserter is still a deserter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the first deserter is not dealt with in time, the 10,000th deserter must be dealt with, which is obviously unconvincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can execute tens of thousands of deserters at once, and the alliance can't afford it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the previous decree of the alliance is amended, such incidents will be re-characterized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, the issue of fairness is involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mixed alliance can bring everyone together. In addition to the common interests, there is also the fairness of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is this fair promise that makes everyone believe that there will be rewards for all sacrifices, and all sacrifices are worthwhile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the fairness is broken, the foundation of the existence of the alliance of the ancient survivors will also be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Process, process together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this continues, more and more problems will accumulate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone takes care of themselves, then we won't have to fight the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seriously dealing with it now is cutting flesh. If you want to deal with it in the future, then you don't need to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this war fails, humans will not allow us to continue to exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humanity has started genocide in the southern continent, and multiple races were directly killed by the whole family because of their involvement in the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They just got involved in the war, we destroyed the human kingdom. Such **** enmity will inevitably be liquidated after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, everyone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either abandon internal conflicts and concentrate on fighting human beings; or immediately pack up and go home, migrate deeper into the world of ice and snow, and settle in areas with harsher natural conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows what kind of ghostly place is in the depths of the ice and snow world. If we really carry out the emigration, if one-tenth of our clansmen can survive, it will be regarded as a blessing from the gods! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The macaque king said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel reality was placed in front of all the kings, and the atmosphere around them became more and more tense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the kings realized that if this problem is not handled well today, the alliance of the ancient survivors will come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These problems do need to be dealt with seriously, but there are too many problems, and too many deserters are involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to use troops. Direct execution would be too wasteful. Give them a chance, let these guys act as death squads, and make meritorious deeds!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many officers and soldiers of various ethnic groups involved, and it is difficult to accurately characterize it, so we simply don't pursue it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the defeated soldiers will be incorporated into the Death Squad, and they will survive after winning three major victories!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fair for all races!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King Multiclaw said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it. It is indeed very fair for all ethnic groups to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces are all sent out in proportion to each race, and if they lose together on the battlefield, each race will not suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that it is unfair to the frontline officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many officers and soldiers did not become deserters. They fought hard until the general situation was over before they were forced to transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the alliance doesn't have time to investigate in depth, so it can only do one size fits all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't do this, the race that has suffered heavy losses in the battle will definitely not be reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's do it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King expressed his opinion immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from other races, only a small part of the defeated soldiers of the Shadow Clan stayed on the front line, and the rest took the opportunity to return to the clan land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The clansmen who left also reported battle losses in the alliance. On the surface, it seemed that the losses were heavy, but in fact the losses were minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain the unity of the alliance, the Shadow King is still willing to bear a small price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the other races are not as big as the shadow race, most of them are secretly reserved, and only a very small number of people fight on the front line with the strength of the whole clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, the giant king gritted his teeth and said, \"Okay! As long as you can do it, my giant family can do it too!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to agree. Kaveh has made too much trouble on the front line, and he must give an explanation to all parties. It is a good ending to be able to end like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the statements of the kings one by one, the matter was quickly confirmed. The originally tense atmosphere gradually eased, and the first alliance crisis landed smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, the situation is not good! We have been running for more than a day, but we still haven't been able to shake off the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I ran too fast yesterday and didn't bring any food. The clansmen are all hungry now. If we keep running like this, we are afraid that we will starve to death before the enemy catches up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the stomach of the evil-eyed giant has already made a \"cuckoo\" protest sound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh just wanted to reprimand, but his belly also protested. Escaping for life is obviously such a high-intensity exercise that it is impossible not to fill your stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then look for it first, and try to get some food from nearby as much as possible, so as to fill your stomach first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the speed must be fast. Although we ran at the front, the broken soldiers of other races were also chasing closely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the clansmen to gather here in two hours. If you miss the time, good luck to you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky and the earth are big, and the food is the biggest. In ancient times, giants were carnivorous races, and now they have become omnivores.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to eat meat. If there is no bread, rice, potatoes... They don't dislike it. Wild fruits, wild vegetables, and leaves can also make do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was because of their strong stomachs that they survived tenaciously. The big eater race that failed to evolve has almost disappeared in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Omnivores can fill the stomach, but the nutrition obviously cannot keep up with meat. They are also giants, but the current giants are not as strong as in ancient times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talent like Kaveh is good, but the elite giants who are being cultivated by the clan are not bad, and their nutrition can basically keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary giants are miserable. Wild fruits, wild vegetables, leaves, grass plants... provide limited nutrition, so many giants are stunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't just the giants who couldn't bear it. All the hungry soldiers of the coalition army were exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the situation of the chasing Warcraft Legion is much better. It seems that they have been chasing, but in fact they are divided into two waves, hanging behind the enemy in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the purpose of luring the enemy, he would have chased after him and defeated the gathered rout soldiers again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There can be one chase and one escape, that is because Hudson specifically ordered the troops to slow down and deliberately hang the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the troops are tracking the enemy, and half of the troops are resting on the road. Anyway, even if the distance is widened, with the speed of the monster cavalry, they can catch up quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rout soldiers running ahead are fine, as long as they are not encountered by the air cavalry of the expeditionary force, they are basically not in danger; the rout soldiers hanging behind are tragic, and they will die if they are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the constant pressure of the expeditionary force, the defeated coalition soldiers would not be able to travel hundreds of miles a day on the muddy road. If they had this speed on weekdays, they would have joined the main force long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the clouds, a man and a bear acted as melon-eating crowd on the back of the dragon, looking down at the enemy army below. There were also peanuts, melon seeds, jugs and milk bottles beside them, and shells would fall down with the wind from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim protested against Hudson and Bear Stearns eating alone, but it was really inconvenient to join such activities as a mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to appease Maxim's wounded heart, Hudson would give him an equal weight of gold coins as compensation every time he carried peanuts and melon seeds up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it seems that they are eating melon seeds, but they are actually eating gold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skillfully crushed the shell, threw the peanuts into his mouth, and took another sip from the bottle, Bear Stearns shook his head and pointed downwards and asked:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this is your eagle-boiling tactic, the effect doesn't seem to be very good?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bear learning the art of war is purely overthinking. Caring about these is mostly out of boredom. After all, watching war movies all the time will be annoying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no time to speed up, the rhythm of the battle is extremely slow, and the plot is not compact at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After giving a cold drink and shaking his head in disdain, Hudson immediately retorted: \"What do you know, this is the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now these defeated soldiers are all supported by their last breath. Once you find that there is no way ahead, you will immediately have a nervous breakdown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, if you don't believe us, take a gamble. I bet that more than half of the officers and soldiers in these routs will surrender, and the bet is your monthly income from the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I bet more than 50% of the defeated soldiers below will surrender!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Bear Stearns' shameless words, Hudson almost choked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's performance was even more exaggerated, he burst out laughing, and the swaying dragon's back scattered melon seeds and peanuts all over the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are thousands of ways to gamble, and Hudson is also well-informed. It is the first time he has encountered the same bet as the bettor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, your skin is really thick!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Maxim's words, the cub nodded and replied: \"Thank you for the compliment, our earth bears are rough-skinned and thick-skinned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, there is nothing good about this scene. Why don't we take the opportunity to go out and do some activities. If we find the treasure that the enemy robbed, we might be able to pay a fortune. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing about getting rich, Maxim, who was originally lazy, suddenly regained his energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, Ben Long also thinks Cheeky Bear's proposal is good. The coalition forces of the ancient survivors occupy such a large territory, so they must have robbed a lot of good things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all enemies anyway, so we don't have to be polite to them. Find where their treasure is stored and give them a bunch of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's talk about it first, we will distribute the spoils according to the size of our efforts. Benlong had to fight again, and he was also responsible for transporting the treasure back, at least half of it had to be divided. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is still very touched by the previous content. His own mounts are mature, and he knows that the family is expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The latter words directly **** him off to death. If Maxim wants to share half of it, will Bear Stearns also get half of it, and he will not earn a cent as the master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a good proposal, but the loot is one-third each. We have to take action in fights, and Baelstein can also contribute to transporting wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't rush to refuse, the Warhammer Kingdom is such a big place. Let you Maxim find it, when will you find it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if you find it, you can grab it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is too difficult to mobilize the army to participate, then the distribution ratio will continue to change. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he missed the space ring again. It's a pity that the craftsmanship of this toy has long been lost, and the surviving interspatial ring was also carefully hidden by the owner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is in a high position, Hudson has no chance to get it. It's not that you can't get it, but that the storage space of the space ring that you can get is too small, and the price you need to pay is still high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mere one or two cubic meters of space is not as good as his dragon and bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the storage methods of these two goods are a bit special, they are delivered into the mouth, but Hudson can be sure that they are not really delivered into the stomach, but form an independent storage space inside the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really put it in your stomach, it will choke the dragon to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How the Earth Bear's storage space came about, Hudson is not very clear, but he is very clear about the Dragon's storage space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the dragon clan's obsession with treasure, it must be a storage space that evolved to store treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no storage space, it will be difficult for the dragon to move. In case a few gold coins are dropped along the way, wouldn't the dragon be distressed to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Done!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Maxim exhorted in pain: \"However, Hudson, if you can use the army, it's better not to use it. If there are more people participating in the distribution of spoils, we will get less!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson could only rub his forehead helplessly. It can only be said that it is worthy of being a giant dragon, and only money is left in its eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the facts are also true. The expeditionary army has the reputation of \"Noble Army\", and the proportion of noble children is not usually high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of noble children means that there are more people who are eligible to share money. Everyone gets a share, and a share is reserved for the powerful in the country. If it falls to him, the coach, he may not even get 5%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Maxim. I know the seriousness of the matter, and there will be no trouble at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Ancient Remnants has just occupied the Warhammer Kingdom not long ago, and it should not have had time to transport things out. There are only a few places where things can be hidden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'll have someone look it up later, and wait until I have a clue before doing it. There is no need to worry about this matter, let's eat the broken soldiers in front of us first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even though the road was still muddy, they still did not stop the cavalry from charging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the scene in front of him, Kaveh decisively ordered: \"Enemy attack, run into the woods!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he had already taken the lead and ran back. Desperately, it can't be this kind of time. The hungry giant has been living on wild vegetables and leaves for the past two days. How can he have the strength to lift a knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human cavalry did not have much deterrent effect on the big giants, but the enemy did not follow the rules. Before they get close, the magic crossbow will be entertained first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant whose reaction was a step slower has become a hedgehog. The rest of the giants exploded with unparalleled speed, and their explosive power in a short period of time even outperformed the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of explosive sprint has a limit after all. After rushing into the woods, the giants sat on the ground to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Really can't run anymore, the giants who have been hungry for two days, their bodies no longer allow them to perform this kind of high-intensity exercise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While resting, the giant soldiers were not idle either. They either picked up the weeds on the ground and fed them to their mouths, or they started to attack the nearby leaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kaveh reacted the fastest and seized an unknown wild fruit tree. Pick off the fist-sized wild fruit and send it directly to your mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's expedient, let's replenish energy first. Pad your stomach, if you fight later, you will have the strength to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant ran into the woods, and the tribes following behind were miserable. It took a lot of effort to gather the team, and immediately ushered in another beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the frantic escape, in order to run faster, everyone threw away all the weapons and armor they could throw away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hungry, demoralized, defeated, bare-handed against the elite cavalry of the expeditionary army, the ending is predictable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No command was needed, and soldiers of all ethnic groups chose to run away. There is a strong enemy in front, and there are pursuers behind. Countless soldiers choose to enter the woods to avoid the edge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small grove soon became a gathering place for the defeated soldiers of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, the chasing cavalry army stopped outside the woods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gaining a respite, the coalition soldiers who survived the catastrophe found a new problem before they had time to rejoice—there was no water source in the woods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cutting off food and water, is clearly the rhythm of killing people. Realizing the problem, the commanders of all ethnic groups glared at Kaveh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being partners with this guy, they are also bad luck for eight lifetimes. Many people are secretly annoyed, why they just follow this guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sweeping up a tree of wild fruits, Kavehe, who had filled his stomach to three-points, looked at the commanders of various ethnic groups with a little embarrassment, showing a smile that was uglier than crying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't want to come to this point! But there is only such a forest nearby, so if you want to avoid the cavalry chasing and killing, you can only run into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, don't worry too much, everyone. Reinforcements are on the way, let's rest here first, and take revenge after the army gathers!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, the last trace of guilt in Kaveh's heart disappeared without a trace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conditions are a little bit difficult, but it is a way out after all, as long as you persevere, you can still survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no supplies, then use leaves and weeds to satisfy hunger. If not, grass roots and bark can also deal with it. When it comes to this kind of thing, Kaveh thinks that it is necessary for his allies to get rid of the bad habit of picky eaters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of water, let the water magicians work hard and play with artificial water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of water magicians in the coalition army is limited and cannot fully meet the needs of the army. At least they can last for a few more days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the rainy season, maybe it will rain again someday. At least when they were fleeing for their lives, light rain often came to cool them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for some time, and wait for the reinforcements from the alliance to arrive, and everything will be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the surrounding area is too open, except for the hill where the grove is located, it is surrounded by flat farmland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After marching all the way in the camp of the Alliance of Ancient Remains, some races can no longer stand it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War also needs to test talent, not all races are fighting races. Restricted by innate factors, some foreign armies have been unable to keep up with the rhythm of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not only can the coalition forces not slow down, they must also speed up their march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the latest news from the front line, our people are trapped in a grove in Hancross Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no water source and logistical supplies, and now the soldiers are relying on blood to persevere. If reinforcements are not available for a long time, the entire army may be wiped out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Snow Eagle King said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the trapped rout does not have the Snow Eagle clan, he still has the most basic view of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the alliance of the ancient survivors was full of conflicts. If the trapped troops were wiped out, the internal conflicts would be further intensified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the contradictions can be suppressed, there is no way to make up for the lost military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and the military strength of the alliance has dropped by a quarter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose one or two more times, then you don't have to think about anything, just go back to your respective homes and prepare to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continental hegemony activities, only the strong can participate, and the weak will only be reduced to sacrifices if they participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King Snow Eagle, it's not that we don't know the problem you mentioned. But the physical strength of soldiers of different races is different. Soldiers of many races can't bear the physical strength of marching for a long time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the troops will be divided into two groups, and the elite troops will be sent to meet them first, and the rest of the troops will be one day late. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Huanyue King said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talent is such a thing, if you have it, you have it, and if you don't, you don't have it. Gathering coalition forces of various ethnic groups with different abilities to act together and requiring everyone to perform equally well is divorced from reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two paths in front of everyone, either to divide the troops to rescue; or to slow down and the whole army to act together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't divide your troops!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemies are all cavalry, and the strongest is mobility. Although the muddy road has certain restrictions on them, the battlefield is controlled by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the enemy army should have launched an attack at this moment to eat up our encircled troops, but they insisted on holding back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has been no action for a long time, obviously waiting for us to divide our troops. If we go according to the enemy's setting, we are likely to suffer a big loss after the division of troops! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King immediately objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war has been led by the nose from the very beginning, and the situation is very unfavorable to them. The Alliance of Ancient Survivors couldn't afford to lose, and couldn't bear the risk of dividing troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the kings were in a stalemate, a beautiful landscape appeared in the sky. Countless elves hovered over the camp on Yalong beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that there are many elves on each sub-dragon beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on a rough estimate, the total number of people may not be less than 5,000. The one-time airdrop of so many troops is enough to prove that the elves attach great importance to this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements came, and the kings who were still entangled in the past suddenly burst into smiles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, long time no see, how are you doing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The melodious voice came from the mouth of a graceful and luxurious young woman, and the hearts of the kings were shocked. Some unrestrained kings could not help but show jealousy between their brows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome Your Honor!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite the reluctance in their hearts, the kings still saluted respectfully, without the slightest arrogance in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely not because of the alliance between the two parties that can make everyone lower their posture so much. When facing other representatives of the elves, everyone has never been so respectful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Look, I'm scaring you. We're all allies, and I won't eat you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't suffered a big loss, this frown and smile would be enough to make countless people fascinated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the charm of vulgar powder, this is a kind of fresh beauty of nature, mixed with a bit of enchanting roses in full bloom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two completely different temperaments perfectly appear in one person, and the temptation to the opposite **** is almost invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the kings really didn't dare to give birth to the heart of peeping. Those who had such thoughts were tossed miserably in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the few kings who kept retreating and wanted to reduce their sense of presence, they knew that their horror experience was a lesson from the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made the stunner in front of me a terrifying sanctuary powerhouse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he is only in his twenties, but his real age is probably older than the grandparents of many kings present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those unlucky ones, because of their verbal gaffes, were controlled by this beautiful young woman, and they started a same-sex multiplayer movement in the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notoriety is second, the key is the psychological shadow left behind, directly shrouded in the depths of their souls, and the functions of the lower body are directly scrapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge, just think about it. Not to mention the elves behind him, the terrifying strength alone made everyone daunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dives cannot raise dragons, not only the talent of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants, but also the population base and resources in hand, cut off their hope of producing top powerhouses from the very beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the top powerhouses at the sanctuary level, even the number of eighth-level masters is very limited. Some races with weak talents can only let the powerhouses of the fifth and sixth ranks come out to support their appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forgive me, my lord. Seeing your magnificence, we rough people feel ashamed. If you offend me, please bear with me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King replied boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to be the boss, you have to take care of things at this time. Even if I'm terribly scared, I still have to come out and talk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman smiled slightly, and had no intention of continuing to beat. The main purpose of taking these kings is to establish their prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, it is to let the alliance of the ancient survivors recognize the reality and figure out who is the boss; on the other hand, it is to frighten all the tribes, so as to avoid the idea of ​​someone's sperm rushing to kill the single elf during the cooperation process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the current point of view, the effect is still very good. When the soldiers of all ethnic groups saw the elves, they all behaved badly. No matter how much I think about it deep in my heart, I dare not go beyond Lei Chi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, this deity will not talk nonsense with you. The CCP has sent 10,000 reinforcements to support you. This is only the vanguard, and the rest will come tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need me to teach you how to fight the next battle, do you? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mainland war has been going on until now, and the two sides have also formed a tacit agreement that the strong in the sanctuary will not make a move. According to the normal situation, she does not need to lead the team this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the situation changed too quickly. The commander of the army sent by the human race was Hudson, the dragon and bear knight, who suddenly broke the balance of high-end power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of a person, the shadow of a tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson doesn't shoot often, as long as a dragon chant breaks through the air, it will affect the morale of both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the forest elf queen was planning to come here in person, but was persuaded by her subordinates. Most of the powerhouses at the sanctuary level mainly restrain them, and rarely engage in life-and-death struggles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, it is enough to send someone to contain Hudson, and there is no need for the Queen to come in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, a strong man in the sanctuary is not enough to mobilize the entire human race to plan, but an elf queen can mobilize the power of all parties in the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman in front of her is not only a strong Sanctuary herself, but also a Sanctuary Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at each other, all the kings replied in unison: \"Don't worry, my lord, we have found the position of the main force of the enemy army. With the strength of both of us, we will be able to defeat the enemy army in one fell swoop!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to hesitate, just let go and do it. Originally, they had an advantage in strength, but now that they had more reinforcements from the elves, their advantage was even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several families were happy and some were sad. After receiving the news of the arrival of elf reinforcements, the atmosphere in the expeditionary army suddenly became dignified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when the human race dominated the mainland, the elves could always be at ease. In addition to their status in a corner, they also had their own powerful strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long lifespan determines the number of powerful elves, far more than ordinary races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest difference between the elf army and other armies is the large number of strong men in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they haven't experienced a lot of tempering like the expeditionary army, with the terror of individual combat power, they can still shock the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, although we are not afraid of the elf army, their strength should not be underestimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, in the previous battles, the knights of the three principalities encountered an army of elves that was less than half of their strength in the field battle, and were beaten to pieces by the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our army is more elite, in terms of combat effectiveness, I am afraid it may not be able to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the battlefield has changed, and our original strategic plan can no longer be implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the next battle, we must re-adjust our strategy according to changes in the battlefield. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle plan that was painstakingly prepared had already been declared a failure before it could be implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any warning, the elves suddenly sent troops. Who can resist this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, if there is nothing we can do, we might as well eat the bait and retreat. Annihilating 50,000 enemy troops is not a waste of time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Ebert suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although military exploits are important, preserving strength is even more important. The expeditionary force has assembled most of the elite of the Alpha Kingdom, and there is no way to explain it if they are lost on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, the expeditionary force has been burdened with the destiny of the kingdom, and has been entrusted with the mission of \"only winning, not losing\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order to let the soldiers light the smoke outside the grove, and the magicians accompanying the army are all moving. I want to smoke bacon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he planned to set fire to the mountain, but the alien coalition forces were really not picky eaters. The leaves and weeds all entered their stomachs, and now they started to peel off the bark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the originally lush grove, there were only bare trees left, and all the fire starters were gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the fire attack is not enough, it will be smoky. Anyway, if the enemy is forced out from inside, the task will be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thick smoke billowed up, and with the help of the magician, none of the smoke was wasted, and all of it was sent into the woods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the already crowded mountain was attacked by smoke, the coalition soldiers quickly fell into chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coughing sounded all over the place for a while, and it didn't last long. The first batch of soldiers who couldn't bear the baptism of the smoke began to walk out of the woods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't...cough...cough... shoot arrows...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't shoot arrows, let's shoot...ahem...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, the three-headed monster fainted. The defeated soldiers behind hurriedly helped him fill in the word \"surrender\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the political slogan of the expeditionary force \"surrender without killing\" has begun to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to convince everyone, Hudson also deliberately placed the captives caught on the road in a conspicuous position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn traitor...cough cough...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish cursing, Kaveh was choked by the smoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evil-eyed giant, who covered his nose and mouth with a wet cloth, stepped forward to persuade him: \"Brother, this smoke is so disgusting that the clansmen can barely hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we stay, we will become bacon, and many defeated soldiers of all ethnic groups surrendered. Otherwise, let's follow suit! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ahem...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when he was about to reprimand him, Kaveh was choked by the smoke again. It was the evil-eyed giant who tore off a piece of wet cloth and gave it to him with his sharp eyes and quick hands, so that he had a chance to breathe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What the **** is this, why is there a smell...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through the speech, Kaveh got the answer from the evil-eyed giant's embarrassed smile. If there is no water in the woods, you can only use urine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You bastard, you actually use...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he still couldn't throw away the rags in his hands. Compared with the threat of smoke, using diapers is just a matter of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle that as long as I don't say it, no one will know, Kaveh resolutely swallowed the following words back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that there are people covering their mouths and noses with wet cloths everywhere, there is no need to doubt that everyone is self-produced and sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who didn't react, either fled out and surrendered, or were fighting the final struggle against the smoke. Some soldiers with insufficient lung capacity even suffocated directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, covering the mouth and nose with a diaper can only provide relief for a while. Under the influence of the thick smoke, everyone's tears still couldn't help but flow out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, I can't help it. I would rather die on the battlefield than be smoked to death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who shouted, the scene in the woods went out of control, and countless broken soldiers ran out desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big Kavehe stomped his feet, but he still couldn't make a decision to surrender. He just told his subordinates: \"Let's go out first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the broken soldiers rushing out in groups, the expeditionary army who had prepared for a long time shouted in unison: \"Give up your weapons, and those who surrender will not be killed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many weapons that can be used. After running such a long distance, most of the soldiers are unarmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After rushing out of the grove, they collapsed on the ground one by one, panting heavily, with no time to care about the surrounding situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking on the edge of life and death, you will know the value of life. Kaveh, who was originally planning to fight to the death, no longer had the desire to go all out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Surrender...Surrender...We also surrender...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's boiled eagle again, and smoked bacon again. The expeditionary force finally wiped out 50,000 enemy troops at the smallest cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was time to check the battle results, Hudson realized that something was wrong. More than 90% of the enemy soldiers collapsed on the ground and could not stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pastor Ron, what's going on with these guys?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle here is over, but it does not mean that the follow-up battle is also over. Enemy reinforcements are on the way, and the expedition has no time to take care of a group of immobilized prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, most of these guys are exhausted, and a small part is poisoned by smoke. At this moment, their bodies are very fragile and cannot be treated. They can only rest slowly.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ron shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rescue is actually possible, but the price to be paid is too high. It is impossible for the expeditionary force to use the precious magic medicine on these captives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting this answer, Hudson was not angry but happy. \"Surrender, don't kill\" is the political slogan of the expeditionary force to lure the enemy to surrender, and it must not be overthrown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the prisoner himself dies, it has nothing to do with him. As long as it was not massacred by the expeditionary army, it is not a breach of contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the prevailing law in the mainland, there is no requirement that prisoners must be treated. The unspoken rule is only an agreement: to provide medical treatment for noble officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all a group of declining races living in the tribal era. They are all governed by tribal leaders. The most powerful tribal leader is everyone's king, and no aristocratic system has been established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone imitated and came up with the aristocratic system, it has not been recognized by all ethnic groups in the mainland, at least the human race has not recognized it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking into the distance, Hudson's mind flashed. It is definitely not possible for the expeditionary force to withdraw directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you retreat when you hear the elf reinforcements coming, it will definitely hurt the morale of the army. When you fight the elf army again in the future, you will be mentally short.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of political factors or military factors, Hudson must fight the enemy. It is best to be able to keep the elf army on the battlefield forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to send someone to give some rice porridge to the wounded among the captives, and then the army will continue to head south with the prisoners who can move freely!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sneered and ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The last few tens of miles will directly determine the fate of the trapped coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King, the battle on the front line is over, the enemy has turned to the south...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Snow Eagle King's face darkened, only the last twenty miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Snow Eagle King hastily passed the news to the kings of all clans. The enemy has already run away, and there is no point in marching quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chasing and killing does not exist, only cavalry has always chased and killed infantry, and infantry has never chased and killed cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no organized cavalry in the coalition army. It's not that the various ethnic groups don't know the importance of cavalry. They are really trapped in a corner and cannot afford cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since the enemy has left, let's set up camp and let the soldiers rest for two days!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers on the battlefield are expensive and fast. In recent days, the soldiers of the coalition army have been rushing desperately, constantly refreshing the marching records of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a price, most of the weaker soldiers are left behind. Certain races, even clansmen, were left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In such a hurry, I still missed it in the end. I can imagine how depressed I was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shadow King, I'm afraid it's too early to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the spies, the enemy did not massacre the prisoners...the wounded, and there are still many wounded soldiers of various ethnicities on the battlefield waiting for our treatment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Snow Eagle King added in a slightly embarrassed way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also very embarrassing for the alliance to say that a large number of soldiers have been captured in front of outsiders like elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Snow Eagle King was too upright and accidentally exposed the truth. Even if a remedy is carried out, it will be superfluous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to hesitate, since the tribe is still alive, it must be rescued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family backgrounds of all ethnic groups are not strong, and everyone can only selectively ignore the matter of soldiers surrendering as prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the way to the front line, looking at the wounded all over the ground, the kings were dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wounded they understand and the wounded left on the scene are completely two concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only 50,000 troops in total, and there are more than 20,000 lying on the ground. With such a high proportion of seriously wounded, it may have refreshed the history of the mainland war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving up is impossible. The smaller the race, the closer the internal relationship. In front of many clansmen, whoever dared to do such a thing would not be able to sit firmly on the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rescuing the wounded is undoubtedly a severe test for the coalition forces with medical conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn humans, they are so despicable, they...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came to his lips, the giant king suddenly got stuck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the wounded all over the ground are a burden thrown to them by the expeditionary army, as the king of a family, he can't directly say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other kings also scolded the human race for being despicable, but everyone tacitly kept quiet about the despicable method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, you are knowledgeable and well-informed, do you know if there is a cure?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the medical level of the Ancient Remnant Clan Alliance, the people on the ground who have lost their vitality can only rely on themselves to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, being able to survive one out of ten is considered lucky. Even if people can be rescued, they will not live for a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching so many colleagues die, the blow to the morale of the army can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We don't carry many magic potions, so we can't save so many people at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'll have someone bring it over later, you can dilute it with water and distribute it to the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These drugs can only save the lives of the wounded, and they will need to be recuperated for a year or two later. After recovering, it should not be a big problem to live an ordinary life for the rest of my life. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the slightly sad words of the elf young woman, the mood of the kings became even lower. If you can't save everyone, then choose the key treatment!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of words, they can only hold back in their stomachs. The magic medicine is provided by the elves, and others have the right to decide how to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the elves send more potions, everyone dare not even think about it. Allies are not babysitters, and it would be an honor to be able to take out these magic potions for emergency treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the past traditions of various ethnic groups, when such an accident occurs, the priority is usually given to the treatment of clansmen who are valuable to the tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I would rather let the ordinary people die than let the elites return to their peak state. This is the way to continue the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the elves are different, they pursue a different set of values. When such an accident happened, the first thing that came to mind was to save the lives of the clansmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether it can restore combat effectiveness, I will slowly figure out a way later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The initiative is in the hands of the elves. This collision of values ​​naturally ended with the elves winning a big victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the diluted medicine being poured into the mouths of the tribe, the faces of the kings improved a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the efficacy of the diluted healing potion is greatly reduced, it is better than nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are members of their own family, and it is definitely better to survive than to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after, the difficult problem was exposed to everyone. How to deal with the large number of wounded?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely not possible to take it with you on the march. If you bump along the way, you have to toss people away. If you can't take it away, you can only divide your troops to take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army went all the way south, and after walking about seventy or eighty miles, Hudson suddenly ordered: \"Send the order, and set up camp on the spot.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the generals responded in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, such a distance is not safe. If the enemy marched over overnight and used the cover of night to attack the camp, the cavalry advantage of the expeditionary force would be greatly weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this can only be thought about. These days, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors are exhausted. After driving for a day during the day, and then let them play overnight raids, I am afraid that the army will collapse before reaching the destination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of cold weapons, infantry who can travel hundreds of miles a day and maintain combat effectiveness are already the best of the best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army set up their tents, and the fortifications began to be constructed. This is Hudson's habit of leading troops. Regardless of whether there is danger or not, fortifications must be built near the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whispers in the open and in the dark are definitely indispensable. In the nearby hidden areas, some simple traps will also be arranged, usually extending for several miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if the enemy is too disciplined. These cautious styles have not played a role so far. It can't be said that it is completely useless, there are still many beasts that have been recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky beast that strayed into the trap naturally wanted to give the soldiers extra meals. As a result, the pawns who have followed Hudson for a long time have a tendency to evolve into hunters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the improvised simple sand table, the ugly Hudson couldn't bear to look directly at it, and the error in proportion was so big that there was no edge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mark the location of the enemy's logistics team!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the operation of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, he has been eyeing the enemy's logistics. It's just that the enemy's logistics and the army moved together at the beginning, and he was not given a chance to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After unremitting efforts, in order to rescue the trapped troops, the enemy finally couldn't help but divide their troops yesterday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the position and distance marked on the sand table, Hudson frowned. The enemy's logistics supplies are actually only less than forty miles away from the position of the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a short distance, enemy reinforcements can arrive within a few hours. If action is taken, it must be fast and ruthless. Especially in confidential work, it is even more foolproof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the enemy is not far away from being mobilized by us. There is only a day's distance between the logistics force and the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to attack them, I'm afraid you can only travel day and night, and then launch a surprise attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information collected, the enemy's logistics force has about 8,000 people, plus some races that have fallen behind, the total strength will not exceed 15,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat effectiveness of these people is not very strong. If we send out the Warcraft Legion, it will not be difficult to eat them within four hours after the battle breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the transmission of information, it will take time to assemble a large army. The enemy can only reinforce the battlefield before the end of the battle, only a small group of elite troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ancient Remnants Alliance is deeply divided. In the face of such an uncertain battle, when the various clans provide reinforcements, there will inevitably be some people who want to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is uncertain is the elf army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have collected too little information about the elf reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reinforcements come from the main battle armies of the Elven Kingdom, and they can attack forty miles within three hours, there should be no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are entangled by the enemy, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Jose could finish speaking, Hudson smiled slightly. Looting grain and grass is the easiest way to win, but since ancient times, there have been very few successful cases of looting grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shortcomings that everyone can see are often not the real shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle between the two armies, as long as the commander is not stupid, he will protect his food road. In many cases, it seems to be an opportunity, but it is actually a trap arranged by the enemy in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this time it will definitely not be a trap. Hudson does not believe that the ancient survivors who have been separated from the mainstream of the mainland for thousands of years can suddenly emerge as a military strategist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to fighting with soldiers, the elves are not much stronger. As paddling champions in previous continental wars, although their military strength is not weak, their actual combat experience is still too little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the lack of actual combat experience does not affect people's victory. In war, \"one force will drop ten meetings\" is actually the best tactic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can rely on his strength to press the past upright, Hudson is not willing to spend all his time planning here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the point of attacking the enemy's food and grass at such a small distance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they succeed, the enemy's current position is less than two hundred miles away from their stronghold. With the dry food they carry with them, it may be enough to consume on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the enemy's food and grass are seized, we will take away a little at most, and the rest can only be burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we can drag their main force in place, burning food and grass is of value. With an army of elves, it is too difficult to do this! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Hudson's explanation, all the officers were confused. If there is no value in burning the enemy's grain and grass, then why stare at the enemy's grain transport team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the map, Jose seemed to think of something, and then asked in disbelief: \"Marshal, do you want to use raids to lure out the elf army, and then wait for an opportunity to kill them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that everyone couldn't think of it. In fact, this plan is even more difficult to realize than the previous sneak attack on the grain road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be possible to draw out the elf army, but it is almost impossible to wipe them out in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two elites collided, and the battle would definitely not end in a short time. As long as the battle does not fall to one side, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors will be able to reinforce in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are often anti-human. The more impossible things happen, the easier it is to create miracles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I don't have the extravagant hope of destroying the army of elves at once. But it's still possible to lure them out and give them a big gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goal is not high, if one thousand elf troops can be wiped out tonight, the mission is considered complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing can be done, we can just evacuate directly. Being able to eat the enemy's more than 10,000 troops will not lose anything! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As night fell, the coalition camp was brightly lit. The kings of all clans gathered together to inspect the camp, and suffered from two night raids in a row, and they learned to be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid the embarrassing situation of fighting on their own after being attacked by the enemy, a group of kings simply gathered together to form a joint headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people commanding together, the efficiency is definitely not as fast as that of one voice, but it is also an improvement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King, all kings, big things... big things are not good!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our lagging team has been attacked by the enemy, please send troops to support the kings...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, before everyone asked, Xue Ying, who reported the letter, died. When he got closer, everyone found that there was still a sharp arrow stuck in his chest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon receiving the bad news, the faces of all the kings were gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who fall behind the coalition forces are not only the weaker races, but also the logistics supplies of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to rush ahead, everyone took a few days of rations and hurried on the road. Most of the strategic materials were left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** was naturally enough to deal with the remaining resistance forces, but the situation changed after being attacked by the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After looking at each other, the Shadow King was the first to break the silence: \"The enemy is coming fiercely, and the troops in the rear probably won't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't carry much supplies, once we lose the logistical supplies, we won't last for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy takes advantage of the cavalry and stalks us all the way, it will be difficult for the army to return to the station before the supplies are exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to dispatch elite troops to form a rescue advance team. But these are not enough, if you want to be foolproof, you must rely on the strength of your allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's pay homage to His Holiness together, at this time, there is no time to delay! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In times of crisis, the gene for unity is best awakened. A group of kings who panicked saw the solution given by the Shadow King, and they all agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Individual kings were dissatisfied with the shadow king's overreach, and wanted to speak out against it, but suffered from no better solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"ah!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of shouts and screams mixed together, piercing the dark night, and the raging fire told the tragedy of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the previous two night raids, the enemy's preparations this time are obviously more adequate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is human beings who ultimately determine the outcome of a war. The temporarily repaired camp fortifications caused some troubles for the expeditionary force, but they were limited to troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overwhelming giant bear paws directly slapped the archery tower; the giant dragon tail directly swept away the horse-rejection piles and the horse pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was really unruly, and it was agreed that the sanctuary powerhouse would not mix with ordinary people to fight, but it was attacked by the two sanctuary powerhouses from the very beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for the enemy to protest, the monster cavalry who came rolling in rushed into the camp along the passage made by Hudson to start the massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Sometimes knowing too much is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that sanctuary powerhouses have no cards to participate in this level of battle, but as long as the enemies are all dead, then it is equivalent to nothing happening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't been seen through, maybe the expeditionary force might still save their lives, but not now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the reputation of Master Hudson on the mainland, the expeditionary force can only choose to silence. Not only the nearby enemy soldiers will be dealt with, but also the entire camp of enemy soldiers will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In ethnic wars, massacres are normal, but accepting prisoners is an alternative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the strong in the sanctuary violated the rules of the game and participated in the secular war regardless of their identities. Once they did it, it was impossible to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gossip is not terrible, the key is not to leave evidence. If the foreign soldier survived, it would be the best witness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own army may leak the news, but no one will come out to testify against Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, the human race also needs face. This kind of thing that damages the image of the race, no matter how strong the evidence is in the hands of the enemy, it must be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the main reason why Hudson dared to do this was that the Alliance of Ancient Remnants was easy to bully, and there were no strong people at the sanctuary level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they knew that they had suffered a disadvantage, they could only yell a few times, and finally swallowed their anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is changed to a race with sanctuary powerhouses, Hudson must abide by the rules. Everyone has strong people at the sanctuary level, and if they take revenge on each other, no one will be safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing, crazy killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were broken arms and limbs all over the place, mixed with the screams of undead, the whole camp turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of ​​blood, like a purgatory on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel battle is gradually coming to an end, but in the distance, an advance army composed of elite survivors of the ancient times + an elf army, a total of 20,000 alien coalition forces are rushing towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the spoils in the camp, Hudson shook his head secretly. There are indeed a lot of logistical materials, but very few are suitable for expeditionary military use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leave ten days' rations, and the rest will be set on fire when the enemy reinforcements arrive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get it, you will destroy it. Any kindness in war is irresponsible to one's own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the alliance of the ancient survivors sweeping all directions, occupying countless territories and cities, but the amount of food and supplies that can be seized is not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, the Warhammer Kingdom has been fighting for years, and its agricultural production has been severely damaged, so there is not much food in stock;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees frantically poured into the Principality of Moxi, but the news of the arrival of a foreign army is not enough to help everyone make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has a fluke mentality, and no one wants to leave their hometown unless necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real reason is that the nobles saw that the general situation was over, and they were unwilling to leave the enemy with cheap supplies, so they took the \"clearance\" action in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only can supplies not be left to the enemy, but people must also be taken away. Otherwise, those who stay will be the enemy's ready-made military rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that except for a few resistance organizations who were unable to leave due to various reasons, the rest of the people were forced to join the migration team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way to verify whether the enemy's supplies are sufficient is very simple, just look at the quality of the military rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop advancing, there is an ambush ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden sound of the young elf woman made the expeditionary army's ambush plan come to nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of the strong in the sanctuary, no matter how well you cover it up, it's useless. A large group of soldiers and horses is lurking, and people can find it hundreds of meters away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Detour the two wings and launch an attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War cannot be smooth sailing, if the ambush fails, the battle will still continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is different from the past is that while the two armies were clashing, Hudson and the elf young woman also locked each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Marshal Hudson is here, why don't you come out and see him?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magnetic voice of the elven young woman made Hudson's heart flutter, and he secretly wondered whether the person in front of him had the blood of a succubus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately, this unreliable idea was dismissed. The elves who pay attention to blood inheritance cannot tolerate demons polluting their racial blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the elves were not so stubborn in this regard, their situation on the mainland would definitely be much better than it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson believes that as long as the elves are willing to marry outsiders, the nobles of the human race will definitely flock to them. Without a single soldier, one can enter the core of human power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the long lifespan of the elves, after a few hundred years, they will be the ancestors of the nobles of the mainland, and they can completely share the hegemony of the mainland with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, while sharing the hegemony of the continent, the elves will soon be assimilated by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this is determined by the racial base. The difference in numbers between millions of elves and billions of humans is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past history, the races assimilated by the human race were not one or two. There are still many nobles with special bloodlines on the mainland, and their ancestors have married with other races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that with the development of time, the proportion of foreign blood is getting lower and lower, and these mixed races are slowly degenerating like ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course I want to see you, I don't know what to call your honor?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already appeared in mid-air, confronting the elf young woman with the protection of the dragon and bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the moonlight, he could vaguely see the outline of the opponent's body, and his intuition told Hudson that this was a stunner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No evidence is needed, there are not many ugly elves in the first place. If you bless the temperament of a strong man, coupled with that pure white unicorn, the appearance will be raised to another level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doris!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman said resentfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson had vaguely sensed the murderous intent, so he didn't do anything directly, guessing that the opponent was weighing the odds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson also wants to act first, but feels that the risk is a bit high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of a desperate situation, if someone casts some secret technique, it would be a tragedy to die with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hatred between the two parties, but they stand on opposite sides because of their different identities and positions, so there is no need to fight with their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doris, this is not your war, why bring your people here to die?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not just talking nonsense. The peak powerhouses of both sides restrain each other, and the two elite teams also began to collide with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of arrows raining through the sky pierced the silence of the night; the dazzling magic became a bright light in the night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Magician back up quickly, don't enter the range of the enemy's crossbow arrows!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Archers strike back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the anxious voice of command, it can be known that during the short confrontation, the foreign coalition forces suffered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The range of the magic crossbow is far longer than that of the bow and arrow. The magicians who were originally in a safe zone also unfortunately entered the range of firepower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, dozens of magicians were caught off guard and sent directly to meet the elf goddess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending archers to counterattack is also a big failure. Even though the elves' archery talent is far superior to that of humans, their current opponent is the magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is range lethality or firing speed, it is not comparable to ordinary elf archers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to shoot at such a time is undoubtedly asking for humiliation. Even with the blessing of a sharpshooter, it can't withstand the rain of arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the firepower confrontation, the elf army only suffered losses, while the coalition forces of the ancient survivors were purely passively beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the clansmen continue to fall, the giant king ordered angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rush over and fight the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to work hard, the big man of the giant family is really at a disadvantage in this kind of long-range firepower strike.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of rushing out is nothing more than sending him up to be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melee combat is impossible. As long as the enemy is approaching, the reinforcements will retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the attack weapon is a magic crossbow, which has very low requirements for the user, just aim and shoot sideways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all flesh and blood, even if they have rough skin and thick flesh, it will still hurt if they are hit by an arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the giant's screams spread throughout the battlefield. The tragic scene was noticed even by Hudson in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After expressing her dissatisfaction with a cold drink, the beautiful woman did not answer directly, but instead used her mental power to transmit a voice:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Xiaobai, let's shoot together, is there a chance to take down that annoying guy on the other side?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield below suffered a loss. If you want to come back in a short time, the best way is to directly capture the opponent's coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shaking his head, as if he had encountered something terrible, the unicorn turned around and ran away with Doris.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman blushed with anger, hurriedly grabbed the silver horn, and reprimanded sharply:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's wrong with Xiaobai, I'm asking you something, why are you running around?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stupid woman, whoever ran away, I am saving your life!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A giant dragon + a bear of the earth, who can you defeat?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't look at the other person's body shape, it was obvious that he had touched the second-tier Peugeot of the Sanctuary. I feel like that dragon could hit both of us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dai Lisi, you didn't send it up on purpose because you fell in love with that little boy and were too embarrassed to say it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the unicorn could finish speaking, the young elf woman slapped it down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others' unicorns are pure and flawless, but her unicorn looks like a hooligan, and can often drive her to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Smelly Xiaobai, hurry back, I still have to command the battle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While reprimanding her, she directly gave up her plan to capture the king. Hudson's strength seems to be average, but the mount is really powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there was a fight, it would not be worthwhile to get a beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the danger, Doris is not worried. Everyone is a sanctuary, even if you can't win, it is impossible to be given a second all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, hide in the army in a little embarrassment and wait for reinforcements to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doris, if you want to catch that little boy, it's not like you don't have a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you use your charm to seduce and let the other party relax their vigilance, there is still a chance...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf young woman couldn't bear it anymore, and immediately said furiously: \"Shut up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You beast, if you talk nonsense again, I will castrate you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Doris's anger, the Unicorn Holy Beast showed a smug look in its eyes, wanting him to go all out—no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one-horned holy beast family has long been on the verge of extinction, and there may not be more than 30 surviving in the whole continent. As the hopeful genius beast of the revived race, it cannot take risks easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the fight, the elf young woman returned to the battlefield again, and directly confused Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't I just ask tentatively, as for such a big reaction?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle below, the elven army did suffer a lot, but the biggest loss was the coalition army of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the initial losses, the elf mages put up the magic shield as quickly as possible. Although they couldn't completely block the rain of arrows, they also greatly reduced the lethality of the magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it was the stupid Tie Hanhan of the ancient survivors who didn't even have a shield, so they rushed forward desperately, and continued to contribute to the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that everyone has never encountered a rogue style like the Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when encountering such a scene, human knights would bravely confront them head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy changed his tactics, but he didn't follow up to update his tactics, and this was the tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the heavy casualties of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, the flanks of the elf army were also exposed, unknowingly falling into the encirclement of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle was unexpectedly smooth, which doubled Hudson's confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the Mongols in the previous life were able to sweep across the Eurasian continent. If the cavalry and shooting tactics are used well, the power is really beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with archers, magic crossbow cavalry is more lethal. Without considering the cost, this is definitely a big killer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, have you thought about it clearly? Your army is already under siege, and continuing to fight will only increase casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this is not your war, just surrender, and the expeditionary army accepts prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that I still have an elf magician group captive in my hand, you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe she was stimulated, but Doris became annoyed and said, \"Shut up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Despicable human race, thanks to you being a famous general in the mainland, you actually...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait, our magician group has become your captive, this is impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    great…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's so easy to lose your temper, how did you become a sanctuary? Could it be that the talents of the elves are so strong?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can answer Hudson's question, but the perception of the sanctuary deep in his heart has changed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the comprehension of laws has nothing to do with xinxing, but purely depends on talent, luck and blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that magicians and knights don't put forward requirements for xinxing, and there is no special way to exercise xinxing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, this has nothing to do with the great elf goddess. When it comes to the battlefield, we are all soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are born for war, but they are definitely not meaningless sacrifices. Why continue a war that is doomed to fail?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population of the elves is small, and it is what you, the coach, should do to save the lives of the people as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the ancient Ten Thousand Races Convention, I can guarantee the treatment of your captives. As long as the nobles pay the ransom after the war, you can leave. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried his best to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, after a brief gaffe, the elf young woman had already recovered, and she saw through his sinister intentions at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson, is it possible that your great reputation is all based on lip service?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So what if we have the upper hand, our reinforcements are already on the way and will be here soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless your subordinates can destroy us within an hour, otherwise...hehe...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change of face left Hudson very speechless. Sure enough, there is nothing to be fooled by the hundreds of years old antique.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doris, are you sure the reinforcements will arrive on time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that you think that I didn't arrange for people to stop the reinforcements; or do you think that the army of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants is all elite, and my people can't even delay time? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden voice of questioning, under the blessing of magic, directly spread throughout the entire battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these words were not only for Doris, but also for all the soldiers on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present has a say on whether the army of the Ancient Remnants Alliance is elite. Especially the soldiers of the Allied Forces of the Remnants of Ancient Clans on the battlefield, they knew the most information and had the least confidence in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As carefully selected elites, they are passively beaten on the battlefield, so how dare they have confidence in their colleagues whose combat effectiveness is not as good as theirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's tricked!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the morale of the army was affected, the young elf woman immediately understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the established facts have been created, and it is impossible to restore them. All the soldiers of the foreign coalition knew that reinforcements could not arrive on time, and panic gradually dominated everyone's minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson has good means, but unfortunately we are not so weak. Although your expeditionary army is known as a 100,000-strong army, it actually only has more than 35,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has experienced many wars successively, and it is impossible that there will be no damage. Except for these troops on the battlefield, I am afraid there will not be many left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to divide our troops to stop our reinforcements, we must have troops to divide. How long can a few thousand soldiers and horses delay the army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half an hour, an hour? Such a short time will pass after a while. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris hastily made amends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these soothing words didn't work as well as expected. On the contrary, it proved from the side that the reinforcements were blocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After completing the psychological tactics, Hudson just smiled and said nothing. The more this is the case, the more calm you have to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long the reinforcements can be delayed, Hudson is not sure. Originally, he just wanted to take advantage of it and left, but he never expected that the enemy would cooperate so well, and Qingche Jiancong would kill him right away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But whenever the enemy brings a heavy infantry, the lethality of the magic crossbow will be greatly reduced. The lethality of the arrow also changes with the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within fifty steps, arrows can easily penetrate heavy infantry armor; at a distance of seventy steps, arrows can only penetrate ordinary armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the distance is extended to one hundred and fifty steps away, and the arrow lands on the armor, only one sound will be heard, and at most one mark will be left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Armor can block it, but it does not mean that flesh and blood can also block it. Even at a distance of two or three hundred steps, being hit by an arrow will still kill a person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffering on the battlefield is painful. Watching all the elf soldiers fall, Doris gradually showed anxiety on her face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf army below has already launched a counterattack desperately, but the situation on the battlefield made her terrified. Even if the two sides fight together, the human cavalry will not lose at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the continuous sneak attacks of crossbow arrows, an average of three elf soldiers were killed before a human cavalry could be taken away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the elves, this style of play is a complete blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the scale of the expeditionary force, we can tell that the ability to produce more than 30,000 elite cavalry means that they can be replicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the huge base of the human race, as long as they are willing to spend money and resources on it, it is possible to cultivate cavalry like 100,000 or a million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Retreat\", this thought was suppressed by Doris as soon as it arose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a frontal confrontation, the army can still persist. If they retreat, they will expose their backs to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war of attrition continues, and the exchange ratio on the battlefield is gradually shrinking. There is no way, the magic crossbow shoots happily, but the consumption of arrows is also high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original kite tactics have now become a head-on war of attrition. At the juncture of life and death, the elf army still showed its due qualities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to Doris's full of sorrow, Hudson still smiled unabated. Even in close combat, cavalry still has an advantage over infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing to consume like this, it is only a matter of time before the entire elf army is wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't get entangled with the enemy, just disrupt their marching rhythm!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Detour flank attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose kept ordering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stopping the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, this is the first time in his life that he has truly commanded a large army to fight, so he can play to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's destroy the enemy's camp!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson gave him the order to delay the time as much as possible, and there is no requirement for how to fight specifically, as long as the Warcraft Legion does not suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy army was less than 20 miles away from the camp, and he sneaked up on the enemy five times and pretended to attack the opponent's camp three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific record cannot be counted. Anyway, the purpose of delaying time has indeed been achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marching team of 200,000 troops is not an ordinary length. Randomly picking a location to attack can cause quite a bit of chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the ancient survivors are still advancing, but the speed of the march is really worrying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, they should have arrived at the battlefield at this moment, but they only walked halfway, which made the scalps of all the kings feel numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they finally understand why the tens of thousands of Beamon cavalry were able to entangle with the 700,000 Warhammer Kingdom army for several months, and finally cooperated with the orc army to win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are in a similar situation. In order to guard against the enemy's cavalry sneak attack, the kings of various clans had to order to march forward in formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The safety of the army is guaranteed, and the speed of the march has also been delayed. Marching in formation in the dark is also a test for the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the roads could not lay down the army formation, non-combat attrition was not normal. Accidentally step on a trap, or accidentally slip, or... There are too many accidents that may happen in the dark night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lords, the enemy is attacking our camp again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news from Xue Ying, the kings didn't respond. Obviously, after hearing too many stories about how the wolf came, everyone became numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ignore them, let's move on!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle situation on the front line is in crisis, and the reinforcements sent have fallen into the enemy's siege. If it is delayed any longer, not to mention keeping food and grass, I am afraid that the reinforcements sent in front may join in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the elf army, if our reinforcements are slow and suffer heavy losses, we will not be able to explain it to our allies. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The macaque king said with a tired face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The useless battle led by the enemy is really worrying. I was really afraid of tossing, so I simply ignored it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"well!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while of sighing, the several kings who originally wanted to oppose also chose to shut up at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since everyone does not object, then pass on the order and let the troops march faster!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the front line, more than half of the advance troops have been killed, and the loss of the elf army is not rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Her Majesty was also enraged by the enemy commander. If she was slower, she would vent her anger on us, and you can imagine the consequences. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King made the final decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has made similar decisions several times. The right to speak in the alliance is gradually expanding unconsciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that there is no overwhelming strength, so it is difficult to convince everyone. Relying on subtle recognition alone is a long-term process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle is still going on. The battlefield is like a flesh and blood mill, constantly devouring the lives of officers and soldiers on both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he was used to seeing life and death, Hudson's expression became a bit dignified. This is the first real elite confrontation in the years of the South and North Wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite are forged in the blood and fire, and tonight will be the transformation of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There are less than 3,000 alien coalition forces left on the battlefield, and it seems that if you put in more effort, the enemy army can be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"hehe…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, let you do all kinds of calculations, didn't you think that you will still fall short in the end? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The silver bell-like laughter revealed Doris' inner joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a night of torment, the moment of reversal finally came. This feeling is beyond words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, don't get too excited, let's see how many active elves there are on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Okay, this battle should be over, we have a chance to see you again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson decisively ordered the withdrawal of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle has progressed so far, and the expeditionary force is also very exhausted. If it continues, it may be able to wipe out the enemy army in front of it, but its own losses will also be very heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson's proud expression, the elf young woman's heart sank to the bottom of the valley.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire army was almost wiped out, but only part of the remnants were saved, which is not a victory at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Doris' anger swelled to the limit. Considering the difference in force between the two sides, he put off the idea of ​​fighting Hudson, and his eyes were full of murderous intent in the direction of the reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously my family came to help, but in the end it became the main force on the battlefield, but my allies watched the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fellow troops sent by the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants had almost died in the battle. The few survivors were scattered on the battlefield, and they couldn't be found without looking carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't see it, it doesn't exist. After ignoring these teammates, Doris directly labeled the Alliance of Ancient Remnants as unreliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a few thousand human cavalry can hold back an army of 200,000 for so long?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the seed of doubt was born, it became a thorn buried deep in her heart, which would never go away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just rationally told him that there is no reason for the Alliance of Ancient Remnants to cheat teammates at this time. Without the support of the elves, they could not escape the liquidation of the human race after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the direction Hudson left, Doris said to herself, \"Is this part of your plan?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the famous generals of the human race are so powerful, let the elves be flexible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving the battlefield, looking down at the shrinking team below, Hudson secretly sighed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop to take a rest and count the casualties of each unit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priest is doing his best to treat the wounded. He can use magic potions, but try not to use divine spells. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the current location is not safe, only thirty miles away from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the expeditionary army was exhausted, and the enemy army was also tossed all day and night, and was in a state of exhaustion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were 20,000 more cavalry in his hands, Hudson would never mind killing his carbine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's forget it now, it's not worthwhile to exchange the elite of the kingdom with the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this time I was greedy for credit and failed to buy enough time for the army. Please deal with...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Jose could finish his apology, Hudson laughed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, not only are you innocent, but you have merit!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Missed the opportunity to wipe out the remnants of the enemy army, but got the opportunity to defeat the main force of the enemy army. No matter how you look at it, it is a big profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is ever-changing. If there is a chance to burn down the enemy camp, I would give up the interception plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what Hudson said, Jose became even more disturbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where did he want to break through the enemy camp, he was playing \"surround Wei and save Zhao\" with the enemy exactly as Hudson ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How come after playing a few times, the enemy army figured out his strength and thought it was impossible for him to break through the camp with so few troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy refused to turn around and return for help, so the feint attack that was originally planned turned into a strong attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, after we broke through the enemy camp, we didn't find much food and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the 10,000 enemy troops left behind, the rest are wounded. For this reason, three hundred monster cavalry were lost, and the record is actually very average! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the record is good or bad, it also depends on who you compare it with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the battle commanded by Hudson, sacrificing three hundred monster cavalry in exchange for such a result is really impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 50,000 reinforcements who stormed the enemy before, the Warcraft Legion did not have such a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the account can't be calculated in this way. Uncontrollable factors like pig teammates can't be expected to encounter every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"General Jose, from a tactical point of view, the actual benefits of this battle are indeed not great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with our previous achievements, it is not worth mentioning. But war is not only military, but more political.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Alliance of Ancient Remnants were slow to move, causing the elves to be disabled by us. Can the elves have no idea?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a rift is created, it is not so simple to bridge it. At least in the short term, it is impossible for the elves to send reinforcements to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of military affairs, except for the fact that the more than 20,000 wounded are not counted as military achievements, we can roughly calculate an account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, you wiped out 15,000 enemy troops transporting food and grass, and then severely damaged more than 20,000 enemy reinforcements. You also contributed to the record of annihilating 10,000 enemies. It is conservatively estimated that you wiped out more than 45,000 enemy troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you consider your sneak attack halfway and the enemy's non-combat attrition, the loss of the foreign coalition forces may be around 50,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much food and grass you have in the burned camp, the enemy army is now out of food, and the morale of the army will definitely be hit hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps all ethnic groups have hidden some carry-on dry food, but the quantity is absolutely impossible. Maybe they will have another fight because of the dry food problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two ways before them, either use the corpses on the battlefield as rations, or slaughter the mounts and animals to fill the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter to the soldiers of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants, but the soldiers of the Elf clan definitely cannot accept taking the corpses of their companions as rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When races with different philosophies collide, there will inevitably be conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides us, the next two hundred miles will not be easy for the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surprise came so suddenly that Hudson was a little confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy camp is still there, regardless of whether there is a shortage of food, it can be solved secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all the soldiers know that the food and grass have been destroyed, and if the officers take out meat as military rations, the source will be exposed in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many races in the Alliance of Ancient Remnants. Some races are used to eating the corpses of their companions, but more are against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inevitable that the already unstable alliance will be divided again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many unfavorable factors superimposed, Hudson doesn't believe that he still can't find a chance to severely injure the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While rejoicing, Hudson is also a little worried. The number of troops following him has become less and less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the 35,000 people who went on the expedition, there are now less than 30,000 left, including 5,000 wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expeditionary force hadn't won all the way to cover up the impact of casualties, the morale of the army would have been affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the army must rest after this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, the atmosphere of the coalition forces of different races was particularly bleak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Desperately rushed to the reinforcements, but did not expect to be lonely. Even though they knew that the enemy's position was not far away, no one proposed to pursue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a tired army. If you insist on catching up and encounter the enemy army who has rested for a few hours, it will be killing you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you all doing to eat, why did you delay arriving until now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris asked murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing a full-stacked elf army, I thought it would be able to shine and make the elf family famous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that within a few days of arriving at the front line, the entire army was almost wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happened, and an explanation must be given to the clan. Otherwise, even if they are strong in the sanctuary, they will be punished when they go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for Doris to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She sent troops at the invitation of the Ancient Remnant Clan Alliance. In the end, because the reinforcements did not arrive on time, the army suffered heavy losses. The responsibility lies with the Ancient Remnant Clan Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what happened in the middle, that is the responsibility of the Alliance of the Ancient Remains itself. She just needs to catch them not fulfilling the agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris doesn't care about the follow-up effects. The premise of friendship is reciprocity, and the performance of the alliance of the ancient survivors is really difficult to gain her respect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they fall out, it won't affect the overall situation. From the moment they send troops to join the war, the Alliance of Ancient Remnants has no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has been fought until now, even if they are willing to defect, it is impossible for the human race to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the invasion of the Ancient Remnant Race Alliance, the number of human races who died has long been in the millions. If the indirect death is counted, it is afraid that it will soon exceed tens of millions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many people have died, if there is no response, how can the human race have the nerve to say that they are the overlord of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson's political inducement to surrender, it is actually a painting. Hudson would not have the guts to ask him to surrender the Ancient Remnant Alliance and promise not to liquidate them after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, the slogan thrown by Hudson was just \"those who surrender will not be killed\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not killing does not mean not pursuing accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A typical political slogan, it's okay to fool the soldiers of the ancient survivors who don't read much, and the old nobles who are politically skilled can see the problem at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the Alpha Kingdom does not have to hold them accountable, but no one knows whether the Principality of Moxie, the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms, and the countries of the Northern Continent should hold them accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final fate is either reduced to a slave, or taken out by the nobles to a public trial to gain reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the countries that will occupy the land of the Warhammer Kingdom in the future need to focus on this aspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we were blocked by enemy troops on the road, and we broke through the blockade only after suffering heavy casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reinforce the front line in time, we didn't even take care of the rear camp, resulting in the massacre of more than 10,000 defenders and more than 20,000 wounded! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King, who was pushed to the front, explained with a bitter face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not easy to be the boss, he has not yet become the boss of the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants, but he was pushed out to carry the thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the violent venerable in front of him was so angry that he slapped him to death directly, it would be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Ancient Remained Clans has no ability to stand up for him, and the weak Shadow Clan dare not compare blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Allies\" are just the last fig leaf. With the continuous failures on the battlefield, the voice of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants is constantly being weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to vent her anger, but suddenly thought of something, Doris suddenly suppressed her anger, pretending to be helpless and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, things have already happened, saying these things at this moment can't change anything, let's think about the next battle situation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How difficult Hudson is, I think you know it well. Now that the coalition forces have suffered heavy losses and lost supplies, it is impossible for him to let go of this opportunity to make things worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you have a solution? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that she is always thinking about her allies, but in fact, Doris doesn't take the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to speak politely is because these guys still have final use value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unrealistic to expect them to destroy the expeditionary army, but it is also good news for the elves to cause certain casualties to the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alliance of the Remained Ancient Clans loses too quickly, the legion she led may have to lose all of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the battle last night, almost everyone in the Elf Legion was injured, and more than two-thirds of them were seriously injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current state of the wounded, at least half of the wounded should be broken in for the priests to cast divine spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Death at the hands of the enemy made Doris feel pain, and it was even worse if she died at the hands of her own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not really hopeless, the magic krypton life is too powerful, and there are magic potions as substitutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you lack arms and legs and want to be reborn with severed limbs, you can wait until your body recovers, and there is no need to rush to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the kings look at me and I look at you, each and every one of them has helplessness written on their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the level of civilization, they are large tribal chiefs. The vast majority of races do not even have written words, and knowledge is passed on by word of mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I will tell you the truth. We are all rough people, and we have used our previous experience in fighting with soldiers. We have never encountered the current situation, and we don't know how to learn from it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please show me the solution to break the situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King said boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He knows very well that this proposal will make many people in the league uncomfortable, but he will not do it if he can choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opposition is non-existent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris's murderous look just now scared everyone. Who knows what will happen next after angering this person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you have anything to think about, hurry up and deal with the logistics supplies! Could it be that you want to lead the team to chase the enemy's cavalry at this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether to counsel or not. The main reason is that the ancient survivors were too poor to support cavalry, which caused the current strategic passiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The general direction can be judged at a glance, but the specific implementation is another big problem. Sending people from the rear to deliver supplies is to contribute to the enemy's record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the distance between the camps of the two sides, it can be seen that the expeditionary army is preparing to entangle them and does not want this army to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the paper data alone, the alliance has a total force of 180,000, which is six times that of the enemy, occupying an absolute advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is that there is no advantage in military strength, but it cannot be used. If you want to start a counterattack, you can't find a chance to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After looking at each other, the expressions of the kings suddenly became dignified. There is a solution to food and grass, but no one dares to propose it at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The difference is that in the past, you had to write it yourself, modify it, and get sprayed, but now you only need to sign it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Records not only need to be displayed on the battlefield, but must also be publicized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to be high-profile. After losing so many elites, there is no achievement, and the country can't explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After last night's battle, another stubborn illness in the army was placed in front of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has always been an unspoken rule in the Royal Army. The appointment of officers must follow the principle of \"Born &gt; Strength &gt; Ability\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to break the rules of the game, unless when it comes to life and death, there is no better choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was able to take the top position at the beginning, it was because he was not only capable of fighting, but also the strongest in the kingdom, and the officers and soldiers below believed him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the mess that no one can clean up, everyone can only push him to the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is obviously not up to that point. If you want to make personnel adjustments, Hudson must also abide by the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle last night, the Warcraft Legion suffered heavy losses, a large part of which was due to poor internal coordination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appointment of Jose as the temporary commander aroused the dissatisfaction of the nobles in the army, and the execution of the order was compromised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, it is a temporary appointment. If it is a permanent position, I am afraid that the people below will be able to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the expeditionary force is just a pieced together elite, and Hudson can only control the army with his own prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mid-level and high-level officers in the army are all well-known, and their status is not as low as that of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reform is impossible, the final decisive battle is imminent, and the most important thing now is stability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this unspoken rule is not only popular in the expeditionary army, but also played in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has shortcomings, so they can't be counted as shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the kingdom's army is not so solidified. Hudson can also choose a powerful superior from among nobles with comparable status, or appoint a noble with a stronger background and a slightly inferior background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the ability is too illusory, it is difficult to convince everyone, unlike the strength that can be displayed on the bright side, if you are not convinced, just go out and fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, if you are born noble + powerful, you will be a proper general in the army and a reserve coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know how to be a man, it is normal to be directly appointed as the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds a little childish, but compared to the year when Crown Prince Caesar debuted as the coach, this is already very cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the expeditionary force is actually not bad. Everyone knows the risks of this trip, and they don't have any ability, and they won't send them to the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"well!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Hudson reluctantly crossed Jose off the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the four major legions of the Expeditionary Army, the Warcraft Legion has the least strength, but because of its strong combat effectiveness, its status is the highest, and it is known as the Kingdom's First Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to compete for this position, the great nobles were about to squeeze their heads. In the end, it was Hudson who announced that he was acting as an agent, which calmed down the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This agent has arrived now. He originally wanted to support Jose to take over the position, but now he finds that there is too much resistance, so he can only cancel the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Appointing a commoner as the head of the legion, unless he is a strong person at the sanctuary level, he will not be able to convince the crowd at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if it is really a strong man in the sanctuary, he will not be a commoner. No matter which country you are in, you can get a good title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Mr. Jose!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is crossed out now is not only Jose's position as legion commander, but also his career in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is willing to share an extra piece of cake, and be exposed to the nobles in advance, and the result is that they will not even have the opportunity to enter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, Jose's previous scapegoat will be magnified and publicized again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have made military achievements, don't even think about stepping into the circle of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this is none of your business. Even if everyone agrees, it's useless. Your Majesty doesn't want to see me active in front of your eyes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last trace of luck in my heart was shattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing glory, it is too difficult to start from scratch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, if Jose's target is not the legion commander, but the centurion below, everyone will not mind selling Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after all, it is a person who has commanded hundreds of thousands of troops, even if he is only the deputy commander, his expectations have been magnified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This workplace is similar. No matter how destitute a person who has served as a vice president of a top listed company, it is impossible to start from the bottom of the company.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no reminder, because Hudson knew that people are lucky, and he would not be reconciled if he didn't try it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply give a chance to stop Jose's thoughts, so that he can stay and work with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, don't think about it too much. His Majesty the King also has his difficulties, mainly due to the persistent diseases in the Royal Army that hurt people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These disadvantages will change sooner or later. After the Continental War is over, I will propose restructuring to the Kingdom again to clean up these persistent problems. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said kindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a \"loyal minister\", he will never speak ill of his king in front of his subordinates. This is a matter of principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for clearing up the stubborn diseases in the army, just listen to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is a time of war, and it seems that it is not suitable for reform, but it is the time when the kingdom is most motivated to carry out military system reform, and it is also the time when vested interest groups are most likely to make concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Continental War is over, the crisis will no longer exist, so why reform?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's one thing to change or not, but it's another thing to mention it or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the marshal of the kingdom, Hudson is obliged to make the kingdom's army stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't do it, it was hindered by vested interest groups, not his marshal dereliction of duty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearing the label of a reformist and eager to change the status quo, the group will automatically move closer to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson hated forming cliques the most, but the reality told him that if he wanted to get along well, he had to form cliques.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when your status reaches a certain level, you represent not only yourself, but also a group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The end of the lonely family is usually not very good. Most of the elegiac songs of unfortunate heroes did not think clearly about this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere in the coalition army camp of the ancient survivors is extremely tense at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp was destroyed, and not only food and grass were lost, but camp tents, consumable ordnance, and various supplies were all destroyed in the raging fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The days of hunger and cold are the most difficult. In order not to starve, some races extended their tentacles to the corpses of their comrades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Paper can't contain the flames, everyone is starving and freezing, it's hard not to expose your **** meat over there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding out that people from their own tribe were roasted by their allies, who can bear it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some hostile races with bad relationship with each other directly fought in the camp, and when the kings of various races intervened, a pile of corpses were added to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People were killed, and things became more and more complicated. It doesn't matter whether it's reasonable or not, the kings of this clan are always the ones who help their relatives but don't help them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was a king trying to persuade him to fight, but he just persuaded him, and his own tribe was also involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the threat of the expeditionary force, there might be a civil war in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting such a teammate, Doris only felt tired. Due to the needs of the situation, she had to mediate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's less than 200 miles away from the camp, everyone speeds up the march, we can arrive in three or four days, and it will pass after a little patience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what have you guys done?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a bite to eat, actually doing something to the corpse of a comrade-in-arms, it's like a beast!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All participants will be included in death camps. Next, they will perform the most dangerous mission and use blood to atone for their actions!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, all corpses must be burned, and similar things will be killed without mercy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't take it seriously, if you can't handle it now, I don't mind helping you make up your mind. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris sternly warned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the alliance of ancient survivors with many internal conflicts, it is impossible to satisfy all parties, so simply stand in support of one side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrogance of the elves made her choose the side that was closer to her own ideals. The barbaric behavior of using the corpses of comrades-in-arms as food must be severely cracked down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is just the beginning, and only a few races are participating. If this trend is not curbed immediately, maybe someday the elves will also be on the grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If that scene really happened, Doris can guarantee that she will definitely go crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right. Some barbaric races must be severely punished!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King was the first to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to unify the alliance of the ancient survivors, you must first establish a civilization system. According to the current barbaric gameplay, even if unity is achieved, it is only a nominal unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the Shadow Clan, no matter how hard they try, they can't do this. In order to complete the plan, the support of the elves must be obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for offending people, there is no need to worry about it. The race involved was placed in a death camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the powerful combat power shown by the enemy, even normal missions are dangerous, let alone the most dangerous missions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that someone took the lead, except for the few unlucky kings involved in the case, the rest of the kings expressed their support one after another, lest they be missed by Dai Lisi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The storm subsided, but the problem was not resolved. Under normal circumstances, it is only a three or four day journey, and even if there is a shortage of food, they can persist, but the current situation is not normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force is too close to them, and they can encounter the opponent's rangers on daily patrols. The current peace is that the opponent is tired from fighting, and the enemy will still come back to make trouble for them after the rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the marching speed will inevitably be greatly affected. What's more, there are still a lot of wounded in the army. Doris may not care about the wounded of her allies, but the wounded of the elves must be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the speed of the army is likely to be lower than normal. Originally, the journey of three or four days of rapid marching may not be able to be completed in five or six days now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Omnivorous races are okay, without food, they can deal with it for a few days with leaves, bark, and grass roots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other races are embarrassed. Now they still have the strength to fight. After starving for a few days, they will all become soft-legged shrimps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the enemy launched a general attack, but his own soldiers were too hungry and weak to lift their guns, it would be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, how to solve the problem of food?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three-headed monster asked pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who were dealt with the most just now were all his clansmen. As a race that is used to eating the same kind, it really can't understand Doris's approach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glaring fiercely, Doris said angrily: \"If there is no food, then go out and look for it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You attack so fast, I don't believe that human beings have destroyed all the supplies. Look carefully, there will always be missing supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that there are resistance armed forces. If they can persevere, they will definitely have a lot of food and supplies in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the solutions are given to you, you can figure out the rest yourself! Take advantage of the fact that the enemy is resting at this moment, hurry up, otherwise there will be no chance if it is too late. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Doris turned and left. Her intuition told her that she couldn't stay any longer, otherwise more troubles would come to her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She doesn't know if the coalition's food shortage can be solved, but the elves have food anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle last night, many horses died. These are the trophies of the elf army. It is definitely not enough to supply the entire army, but they can still last for a few days if they are only provided to the elf army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the clouds, a man and a dragon were looking down at the camp below, as if they were looking for something. Especially Maxim's performance was the most exaggerated, almost drooling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to intelligence, this is the resident of the Ancient Remains Alliance in the province of Deklas. There are also deep wheel marks nearby. If there is treasure hidden, this is definitely the most likely place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look carefully, the number of soldiers patrolling the northwest camp is obviously more than other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have been staring at it for so long, but no one has come in or out. On the contrary, it is the warehouse in the other direction, and people come in and out from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to do something, it is best to create chaos in the camp and transfer these defenders. Or choose the right opportunity to sneak in and get back our treasure! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson fixed the **** on the unseen treasure without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy snatched everything from the local nobles. The nobles in the world belonged to one family, and the treasures of the nobles of the Warhammer Kingdom were equivalent to his treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's not about grabbing, but coming here to get back what belongs to me. Perseveringly, the enemy refused to cooperate, so he could only resort to brutal measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, the enemy has a lot of defenders. If there is a frontal fight, I'm afraid that idiot Maxim will ignore you, so let's do it at night!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that those ghosts are not there, otherwise they will be released in the dark and kept for safekeeping, causing the enemy to fall into chaos. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speaker has no intention, but the listener has intention. If Bear Stearns hadn't reminded him, Hudson would have almost forgotten that he was still a necromancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to sabotage in secret, necromancers are the most professional. Anyway, if you do it in this place, you are not afraid of being exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A necromancer who has been in seclusion for many years, just came out and found that his homeland was occupied by aliens. It is completely reasonable to take revenge in anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back to the barracks first, and we'll come back at night.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At midnight, the camp of the Allied Forces of the Ancient Remnants in Deklas Province was brightly lit. Not only did the number of patrolling soldiers not decrease, but it became more as night fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You summon the undead army outside to attack the enemy's barracks. No matter whether it succeeds or not, evacuate immediately after casting the magic. The follow-up arson will be carried out by Maxim.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered to the accompanying necromancers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was going to do it alone, but later, considering that the necromancers accompanying the army had been idle all the time and had no chance to play, he simply brought them along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons are all ready-made, looking for an opportunity to burn the grain and grass stored by the enemy in Deklas Province. Once this plan is completed, the enemy will have to explode on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the food and grass here are destroyed, the enemy strongholds within hundreds of miles together will not be able to produce food and grass that can supply the enemy army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson also thought about leading troops to attack this place, but was forced to give up in the end. There is no other reason, it is purely limited terrain, which is not conducive to the performance of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has stationed heavy troops here, and if there is no large army coming, Maxim alone will burn some food and grass at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Hudson. We old bones will definitely be able to handle this trivial matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention, after so many years of learning Necromancer Sky, few of us have never used it, so we have to have fun today, we can't embarrass the Necromancer! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the old man finished speaking, all the necromancers echoed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As officially trained necromancers, they are different from wild necromancers, and their behavior is greatly restricted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can learn undead magic have a restless heart after all. In order not to fall into the situation where everyone shouted and beat them, they could only forcibly suppress the idea of ​​doing something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last orc invasion was an opportunity for everyone to show off, but it was a pity that it was snatched away by the \"elderly group\" who appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, you can make trouble here. No matter what monsters are released, it has nothing to do with us, as long as it doesn't bite us back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Okay, let's get started, I'm going to work too! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, he was already happy. With more of these guys taking the blame, the possibility of him being exposed is even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his magic level is not as high as these guys, the magic power is abundant!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's all about destruction. As long as the undead creatures are summoned, other things have nothing to do with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't control undead creatures to fight, you won't consume much mental power. Maybe the number of undead creatures he can summon may be more than that summoned by the sanctuary necromancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to quantity, and the two sides are simply incomparable in terms of quality. They summoned a high-level undead creature, and by virtue of their aura, they could suppress the army of low-level undead without wisdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the cover of the night, black clouds slowly gathered in the sky, and the huge fluctuation of magic power quickly attracted the attention of the enemy magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Preparing to interfere, there are undead creatures constantly appearing in the camp, such as skeletons, nightmares, dead knights, headless horsemen...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From low-level undead to mid-level undead, Hudson is not picky at all, he will summon whatever undead creature is linked to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the desire for flesh and blood in their bones, even without Hudson's command, the undead creatures also attacked the nearby soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the battle was initiated by the defenders. All ethnic groups in the mainland have the same stance on dealing with undead creatures, that is - kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the undead appearing in the barracks, everyone will naturally not be polite. The **** aura produced by the soldiers' deaths and injuries in the battle directly stimulated a group of undead creatures, pushing the battle to a climax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing, besides killing, is still killing. A group of undead creatures fighting by instinct caused an uproar in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle quickly attracted the attention of the enemy magicians, and a group of magicians who thought they had found their target immediately launched an attack on the place where the magic power fluctuated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who had been prepared for a long time, naturally would not stay where he was and was beaten. He was taken by Maxim to change places, and continued to carry out the great cause of summoning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After changing places five times in a row, the dark sky also enveloped the camp, covering a quarter of the camp in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops, this is the cursed undead sky, we fell for it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only now that I realized this, it was too late. Countless undead creatures soon sprang up under the sky, launching a fierce attack on the nearby defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse, once soldiers die in battle, they will either be devoured by nearby undead or transformed into new undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, a group of strong men in the defenders launched an attack on the undead sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows very well that if this thing is not broken, undead creatures will continue to emerge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the time was right, one man, one dragon and one bear split into two groups. Bear Stearns was in charge of sneaking into the tent to loot property, while Hudson and Maxim continued to create chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to convince the enemy that this was for their grain and grass, Hudson also deliberately burned down a row of grain warehouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson tirelessly summoning the undead, Maxim asked with a trembling voice: \"Hudson, is your magic power endless?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic power of a sixth-level great wizard is actually more powerful than that of the sanctuary dragon. Maxim only feels that the world is crazy.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

My magic power is only a little bit full, and its quality is far inferior to yours.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's explanation made Maxim autistic. This \"a little bit\" is also an exaggeration. If the creatures of all races in the mainland have such abundant magic power, the dragon clan will have to continue to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, you don't want to lie to me! How can the human race have such abundant magic power? Do you have an artifact that stores magic power?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Maxim's injured heart instantly calmed down. The head also turned around, looking at Hudson suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, the brain made up the truth, and there was no problem at all regarding the mysterious compass as an artifact. It was nothing more than a stronger function than ordinary artifacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this artifact is a waste in your hands, why don't you borrow it from me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Benlong casts a hundred and eighty forbidden spells at once, which can scare people to death. Let's unite to loot the mainland, when the time comes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Maxim could finish speaking, Hudson had black lines all over his face. As expected of a giant dragon, his first reaction was how to get rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looting the mainland, how dare you think about it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if there is a sanctuary dragon with unlimited magic power who specializes in wholesale forbidden spells, it is really possible to collect protection fees all over the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raised his hand, and was about to slap it down, but considering that the force interacts, there is no need to go with him, Hudson took it back again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Maxim. After finishing this vote, we will go back to sleep and have everything in our dreams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's looting the mainland, what you're looking for is to find hundreds of female dragons to open a harem, and I won't care about you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bluffing and cheating all went to his head, and it was obvious that he didn't clean up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of the giant dragon has always been intermittently effective. Simply put, everything is negotiable when money is not discussed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The treasures that entered their hands did not spit out again. It is easier to expect them to return it by themselves than to kill the dragon and get the treasure directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, how dare you insult the great dragon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim roared angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resentment in my heart is only reflected in my actions. All of a sudden, the foreign soldiers nearby came to the blood mold one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are arms and legs missing all over the place. There is a chance to kill people directly, but they want to maim people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Be quiet, don't forget the purpose of our trip!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe Hudson's warning had played a role, or maybe the grievance had been vented, and Maxim's movements suddenly became much smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The undead are everywhere, and some small episodes did not arouse the enemy's idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masters in the camp all headed towards the undead sky. Trying to find the necromancer behind the scenes and solve the problem from the source.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that their reaction was a step slow after all. The magicians who completed the plan just happened to leave on the Griffin Dragon, and it was too late to chase and kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, the strong men immediately destroyed the summoning magic circle left on the scene. However, the undead creatures that have been summoned can no longer be taken back, and they need to be responsible for the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Bear Stearns with a happy face, Hudson knew that the job was done, so he didn't stay at the moment, and walked away directly, leaving only the undead creatures everywhere to fight with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things are addictive. After seeing the destructive power of undead creatures, Hudson realized that he was too simple before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they went to the enemy camp once every night, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors would have collapsed long ago, and they would never be able to wait for the reinforcements from the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's hard to handle, the enemy camp is guarded by a strong Sanctuary, unless Doris can be transferred, otherwise he will have to be exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson needs a necromancer's vest to do the dirty work, not for exposure right now. If you want to use undead creatures to attack the enemy, you can only rely on your subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the establishment of the Arcane Academy and the anti-Holy See banner are still effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it hadn't attracted the “heretics” from the Northern Continent to vote, the Kingdom would not have been able to send three Undead Magisters and nine Undead Magisters to accompany the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only necromancers, but also the number of other dark-type professionals in the kingdom is rapidly expanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to stand on the stage, who would like to hide and be a mouse in the ground for the rest of their lives?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Second Arcane Academy in the Mainland has such a great attraction. The Frankish Kingdom that establishes the academy first will only gain more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding the attractiveness of the first kingdom on the mainland to talents, the number of dark-type strongmen in the Frankish kingdom is definitely an astonishing number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't envy this kind of thing. Although the first person to eat crabs can choose the fattest one, he also has to bear the corresponding risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not strong enough to afford the revenge of the Holy See, you will have to go to the grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if the Holy See turns a deaf ear to it, not every country can afford the Arcane Academy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suppression of dark professions is not only related to the needs of the Holy See to spread the faith, but also related to their usual habits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with negative energy every day will inevitably affect your personality, and it is easy to go to extremes when doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a problem in cultivation, it is also possible to massacre the city for strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to regain this group of people for your own use, you must first have the strength to control them and maintain sufficient deterrence at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why are they all coins?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, didn't I tell you that magic equipment and all kinds of cultural relics, classics, magic materials, etc. are the most valuable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins mixed together on the ground look very bluffing, but the actual total value is only 1.8 million. After one is divided into three, even fewer people get it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some precious magic equipment and items with special meaning may be sold for this price for one piece.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Only the Ancient Remnants Alliance can answer this question for you. They only put coins in the warehouse, and I can get these naturally.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Bear Stearns' explanation, before Hudson made a statement, Maxim jumped out first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Big stupid bear, you must be hiding something private, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's heavily guarded camp contains only a pile of coins. You are just as stupid as the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who felt that his quality was insulted, immediately exploded, and replied unceremoniously: \"Stupid dragon, you are as worthless as everyone else, and you only have treasure in your mind!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"you…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the quarrel was about to escalate, Hudson hurriedly dissuaded him: \"Okay, we may have fallen into a misunderstanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of the Ancient Remnants is a group of soil turtles. Except for gold coins and magic equipment, other treasures are simply indistinguishable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic equipment was used on the battlefield, and naturally only a pile of coins remained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to be too disappointed, what we found may only be one of their treasures, and some property may be stored in other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's look for it later, with so many things, they couldn't have shipped them back to their lair so quickly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earth Bear is not a giant dragon, and he doesn't regard money as his life. Hudson still believed in Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you hide property privately, you will always have to cash it out. Especially magic materials and potions, many of which are effective and cannot be stored for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a sloth bear, he will never stand if he can sit, and he will never sit if he can lie down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily needs of the cub are limited to eating, drinking and having fun. The property in the territory alone allows him to realize the freedom of wealth and live a peaceful life ahead of schedule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Bear Stearns go out to find a way to sell the stolen goods, it is better to let him go out to rob, and it is easier to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, as soon as the sky was lighted, the atmosphere in the coalition camp became tense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp in Deklas Province was attacked by undead creatures. The defenders suffered heavy losses, a large amount of strategic materials were burned, and nearly one million gold coins were looted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't doubt it, it must have been done by the human race!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the countries in the Northern Continent, only the Alpha Kingdom has the strength to plan such an action. Maybe the murderer is in the enemy's expeditionary force. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant king spoke first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the kings did not refute. The war between the Alliance of the Ancient Remains and the Human Race has been fighting for almost a year. It is normal to take any targeted measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"King of Giants, there is no point in discussing the identity of the murderer now. No matter who the murderer is, we must first deal with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large amount of strategic materials in the old battalion were burned, and the rest may not be able to support us. It is obviously not advisable to continue to let the army pass by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If strategic adjustments are made, where can we go under the existing circumstances? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Shadow King said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To take revenge on the enemy, he wants more than anyone else. But infantry can't catch up with cavalry, especially if they are hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't handle the enemy, you can only keep yourself first. The sky and the earth are big, and the food is the biggest. No matter how the next strategy is carried out, the food problem must be solved first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many troops you left behind in the province of Deklas, were turned into disgrace by a few mice hiding in the ground?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris asked disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Necromancers, in the eyes of the elves, have never been lowly creatures who cannot stand on the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has a great reputation, but that is only for ordinary people. In the eyes of a top powerhouse like her, undead mages and undead creatures are just like that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's not about the relationship between allies, and you need to take care of everyone's feelings, she would like to ask: \"What kind of waste are you staying behind?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we also left 20,000 troops to guard the old camp, and we also specially selected dangerous terrain that is easy to defend and difficult to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if the enemy sends a 100,000 army to besiege, it is difficult to achieve a breakthrough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that the enemy would be so despicable, and directly send necromancers to summon undead creatures to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the defenders were attracted by the undead creatures in the camp, the enemy completed the cursed undead canopy, and a large number of undead creatures spewed out, causing heavy losses to the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the outbreak of the Great War, those despicable people took the opportunity to set fire to our food and grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My lord, the enemy can still move freely through the camp even though they are discovered by the military masters, which is definitely not something that ordinary eighth-level masters can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an eighth-rank thief, it is impossible to avoid the patrolling soldiers we arranged without leaving any traces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few strong people in the sanctuary of the human race, and the shameless Hudson is active in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the previous battles, this person often attacked ordinary soldiers regardless of etiquette and shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My lord, since that **** Hudson doesn't follow the rules, there's no need for us to be polite to him. Can you teach him a lesson, or find an opportunity to get revenge?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the enemy army also becomes chaotic, the opportunity for us to evacuate will appear. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the Shadow King's proposal, Doris became angry all of a sudden. Is this because she doesn't want to teach Hudson a lesson, she just can't win!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If she could win the opponent, she would have launched an invitation to fight Hudson on the pretext of massacring ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who do you take me for?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These despicable and shameless acts can only be done by that shameless Hudson guy, and the great elf doesn't bother to do it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing is not losing. This can only be due to her high moral character, and it is definitely not because she is afraid of the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perfect, Doris has secretly planned how to bring back the remaining elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if it continues to develop according to the current situation, I am afraid that in the end, it will really be a prisoner for the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as she thought of the terrible scene where the future human race used the elf captives as bargaining chips and threatened the clan to accept their conditions, Doris made up her mind to avoid this kind of thing from happening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are not shifted by personal will, and before the kings discuss a result, the rangers who originally followed the army returned again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact is that everyone's food-raising plan has been completely ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe in the corner of a certain castle, there is still food that humans have not burned, but all of this has nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having seen the power of the expeditionary cavalry, no one dares to suggest a division of troops. I am afraid that the troops after the division will be left alone, and will be surrounded and wiped out by the enemy again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy gathered together to act. In order to reduce the number of casualties of his own troops, Hudson did not dare to order a storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the food problem is the enemy's biggest shortcoming. As long as they are not allowed to obtain logistical supplies, the daily non-combat attrition is an astonishing number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to spend it all the time. In Hudson's view, it is more valuable to drag down the enemy than to defeat the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to send these two letters back to the country and the Principality of Moxi respectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the Mosi people that the overall situation on the battlefield has been settled, and ask them to send five to eight legions to receive the prisoners and regain the lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, bring the strategic materials needed by the expeditionary force. This is a list of strategic materials. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and many of the strategic materials carried by the expeditionary force have been consumed in sevens and eighties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the seizures on the battlefield, some food, cloth and other supplies were replenished, but the one-time arrows dedicated to the magic crossbow were used one less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these things, the combat effectiveness of the expeditionary force would drop by at least 40%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to fighting head-on on the battlefield, it is obviously easier to take advantage of hunting enemies from a long distance with a magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Tom took the letter list and immediately went down to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The war on the Great Plains of Warhammer has been reversed. The human race, which had been defeated for thousands of miles, has now turned back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This strategic reversal has greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the countries in the North Continent. However, before everyone was happy, the bad news followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the elves were stimulated by the battle reports from the front. The ruthless army of elves launched the most violent attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Duchy of Ustad and the Duchy of Fick, which had become unlucky products of elf anger venting, were destroyed on the same day, and the Northern Continent lost its voice for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson, after seeing the battle report, they all called out: Fuck!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle situation is too **** brutal, the elves are just bullying people. In one day, the elf magician group released fifteen forbidden spells on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless defenders of the Duchy of Ustad and the Duchy of Fick were sent directly to the Lord of Dawn without even knowing what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forbidden spells have become wholesale products. Battles of this level used to only occur when two big clans were vying for supremacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, Hudson quickly recovered. The minimum requirement for the curse is: three great magisters from the same department join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the quality is not enough, you can also use the quantity to make up. Several magisters lead a group of magicians, who can also cast forbidden spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that the more people involved, the more difficult it is to control the magic circle. Once it is disturbed by others, it is easy to backfire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the family background of the elves, Hudson didn't think it would be difficult to gather forty-five great magisters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If calculated according to the minimum standard, not to mention releasing fifteen forbidden spells a day, even if the number is multiplied several times, it is not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How rich the elves' family background is, Hudson doesn't know, but he knows the family background of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forty-five eighth-level great magisters in the kingdom certainly don't exist, and it's almost the same if they were replaced by magisters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the eighth-level powerhouses in the kingdom combined, including those recruited from the outside world, are less than forty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on a large number of people, concentrating magicians from all over the country, and releasing ten or eight forbidden spells at the same time without external interference, it is still barely possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that it is weaker than the elves, but this is only a human kingdom, and it is still a human kingdom that has been seriously injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire human race, this base number has increased by ten or twenty times, and there is no difficulty at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the ratio of 40 to 50% of the number of strong people in the human race, Hudson also roughly calculated the family background of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this estimate is not necessarily reliable. People are taking the longevity route + talent route, and it is normal to have a group of immortals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number of strong people is not enough, how can the number of light elves dominate the continent of Aslante?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson found that he seemed to be playing too big. Counting the previous elven magician group, the elven army lost in his hands is probably close to 8,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a race with a population of only a few million and low fertility, such a loss is enough to make people mad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Ustad and the Principality of Fick are now completely acting on his behalf. If the elf queen's anger is not exhausted, other human nations will suffer in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Orton can basically declare that it is cold, and the Principality of Moxi will be miserable if it is not done well. When encountering the army of crazy elves, there is no country in the Northern Continent who is not afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of being missed by the elves, Hudson felt a little uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Involuntarily emerged in my mind, the scene of the three elf queens leading a group of masters from the clan to siege, and the forbidden spells flying all over the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking a sip of herbal tea and calming down, Hudson's hanging heart slowly calmed down again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of this happening is still very low. It's not that the elves don't want to get rid of him, but that the plan is not feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't win, can't you still run?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has never heard of it. Some of the dragon knights who were determined to run away were besieged and killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason for the tragedies of Ustad Principality and Fick Principality is that they are too weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention confronting the enemy head-on, even interfering with the opponent's release of the forbidden spell, they are incapable of doing so. The strength of the two sides is not at the same level at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp of the Expeditionary Army, a group of senior military officers gathered together, looking at the battle report with solemn expressions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The current situation has changed, what do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked routinely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the elves are going to fully intervene in the war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next development of the situation depends on the strategic choices of the elves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Ebert, head of the First Army, replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't mention the consequences, but his face has already revealed his pessimism about the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the previous orc empire, it is known that it is based on the friction of the three major powers of the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no Alpha Kingdom at the front, and any country that is completely attacked by the elf army will be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have no power to control the direction of the elf army's attack. If we want to influence their decision-making, we can only rely on the efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble now is the chain reaction. The orcs on the prairie will definitely be impatient after receiving the news that the elves are fully involved in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure on the northern border has increased greatly, and the kingdom is likely to require us to make a quick decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single alliance of ancient survivors is fine, the problem is that the army of elves may come to kill them at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current plan, we can only quickly eat up the enemy army in front of us, and then divert to enter the Principality of Orton to participate in the defense battle. I hope there is still time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second Army Commander Marquis Medel added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, a group of military officers expressed their views one after another. Everyone was as pessimistic about the current situation as Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone's pessimism can be said, but Hudson can only pretend to be confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Entering the Principality of Orton to participate in the defense battle, that is really too optimistic. It is estimated that when the war on the Great Plains of Warhammer is over, they will already be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the expeditionary force is finished resting, there is a high probability that it will be able to participate in the defense of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson guessed the battlefield, and it was the defense of Dapez again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The western defense line of the Principality of Moxi was all improvised, and only the capital could be called easy to defend but difficult to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, everyone, don't be too pessimistic. The situation in the Northern Continent has collapsed, but the situation in the Southern Continent is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the countries in the Northern Continent fall, the Kingdom will definitely be able to survive until the Continental War is won. What we need to do now is to weaken the enemy army and wait for the turning point to appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, each unit takes turns to harass the enemy, not to pursue mass destruction, but to interfere with their progress and constantly hit the enemy's morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember, defeating the enemy is not the goal, splitting the alliance of the ancient survivors is our strategy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reassured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From defeating the enemy to splitting the alliance of the ancient survivors, the strategic plan has changed, and the style of play is naturally different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if you can completely wipe out the top of the enemy army, it is naturally the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is too idealistic, and the feasibility is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar IV held another high-level meeting of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, his life has been very difficult. With the outbreak of the war, the military became more and more powerful, and he, the king, almost lost his sense of existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is just an illusion. During the war years, resources were tilted towards the military, which was an inevitable result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not ask the king for instructions. On the one hand, war requires efficiency, and on the other hand, he is worried about his military capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the king's decision differs from the military's decision after the report, who should he listen to?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid embarrassing things from happening, all departments simply acted first and then reported to Caesar IV after the matter was done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is solved, but Caesar IV is not happy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are established facts, and if you can't participate in it yourself, it seems to marginalize him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter once or twice. If it happens more often, everyone will find that whether there is a king or not will not affect the operation of the government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For King Power, this is definitely not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to know, the general trend is like this, and no one can change it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that they are making a fuss, it will only leave the impression of the domestic nobles as a foolish king regardless of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There may be powerful ministers ostracizing the king, so let's wait until it appears. At least among the current princes and nobles, no one wants to turn Caesar IV into a rubber stamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV, who had been educated by the royal family, was not stupid, and naturally he would not make trouble at such a time, but the work of consolidating the kingship still needs to be carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves participated in the war in an all-round way, and Caesar IV, who realized the great changes in the international situation, decisively chose to come out to gain a sense of presence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The battle on the Great Plains of Warhammer has entered a critical moment. Marshal Hudson can't leave now, and this meeting will not wait for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palace minister recorded it with a photo stone, and forwarded a copy of the meeting materials to him later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is tense now, we have no time to waste, let's start the meeting directly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero, first tell us about the current pressure on the kingdom and the most likely changes in the battle situation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said calmly, as if everything was in order, but the faces of the great nobles were not good-looking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the speed of the Dragon Knight, it will not take long to return from the front line. Hudson's absence is naturally taken out for political interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is really impossible to leave, or whether the king deliberately chose a time when he could not leave to hold a meeting, the meaning is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The triumphant progress on the battlefield has made Hudson's reputation in the kingdom soar, and with the power in his hand, he has become a real power minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't suppress it, Hudson will enter the central government after the war, and it is very likely that he will directly win the position of prime minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A prime minister with outstanding military exploits can speak more weight than a prime minister with outstanding political achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the local to the central, the kingdom is full of old troops in his army. Where will the king be placed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Effiero replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After the destruction of the Three Kingdoms in the North Sea, the elf army did not stop, and the army was advancing towards the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, their leading troops have now joined forces in the Principality of Orton and the Southern Expeditionary Army of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the two sides is no less than 500,000. The pressure on the front line of the Principality of Orton is very high. Even if the Principality of Moxi sends the main support, it may not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more troublesome is that the elves don't only have the 100,000 army. If they mobilize the clan, they can roughly pull up an army of 500,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This 500,000 is still the elf standard 500,000. If the restrictions are relaxed, this number can continue to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from our human race, as long as the elves are adults, everyone, regardless of gender, can be a soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the population reproduction of the clan, the conscription of the elves is mainly middle-aged and elderly people whose physical strength has not declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom, perhaps only the Expeditionary Corps can confront them head-on, but we have too few such elite troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, the pressure on Marshal Hudson will be very high. If the victory cannot be won quickly, the enemy is likely to send reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the main military pressure on the kingdom is the northern border. After the orc empire destroyed the seven kingdoms of the grassland, it couldn't stand it any longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lords in the north know best that the border frictions in recent days are happening almost every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opinion of the military is that the battlefield on the Western Front should be dominated by diplomacy and supplemented by military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force has created some favorable conditions for diplomatic negotiations. We wiped out eight thousand elf troops one after another, and captured a group of hundreds of magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves have seen our strength, the next key is how to dispel their concerns. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to raise a problem, but it is a headache to solve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether or not the Principality of Moxi can be kept will directly affect the safety of the kingdom's rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the northern line, there is no need to discuss it at all, just hit it directly. The feud between the Alpha Kingdom and the orcs is as deep as the sea, and there is no room for relaxation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can tolerate the kingdom's compromise with the elves, because the loss is not their own interests, and there is no personal pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has contacted the elves, but Marshal Hudson fought too **** the front line, and the three elf queens were all angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedies of the Duchy of Ustad and the Principality of Fick are the elves venting their anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to negotiate, you have to wait until their emotions are vented before starting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been paying close attention to the development of the war situation in the southern continent recently. According to the information we have collected, the Frankish Kingdom is about to win the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victory of the Southern Continent will definitely stimulate the Alien Alliance, and they will help us convince the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how to reassure the elves, there is a high probability that a strong binding contract must be signed. Everyone sitting here will most likely be asked to sign the contract. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The explanation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs made everyone slightly relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also secretly contacted the Alien Alliance, and has achieved certain results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, Earl Francis is not sure, the Alien Alliance will help persuade the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one objected. This kind of thing is inevitable if one wants to survive on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He can do all kinds of secret transactions, so signing a secret contract is naturally not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the secret agreement is not leaked out, it means that the secret agreement does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, in the middle and late stages of the war, the kingdom concentrated all its troops in the northern border, making a gesture of wanting to smash the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change in the strategic plan was directly reflected on the battlefield. The expeditionary force is not seeking to defeat the enemy, but is deliberately provoking conflicts among all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific operation is very simple. Use the mobility of the cavalry to pull out their strongholds first and cut off their logistical supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force is not fighting alone in the early days. After successive victories, not only the resistance armed forces scattered on the Warhammer Great Plains took the initiative to lean over; even the Warhammer nobles who fled to the Principality of Moxi also came to vote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of political savvy knows that they must participate in the Restoration War. Otherwise, even if the lost ground is regained, nothing will happen to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know whether the expeditionary force can help them restore the country, but it does not affect Hudson's political banner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the cooperation of local snakes, Hudson fully utilized the mobility of the cavalry. Even if the enemy sets up a stronghold in the castle fortress, they cannot resist the original owner leading the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a burden to fight with Moxi's army when the troops are defeated; but when they return to their hometown and want to regain their homeland, it is another state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force was at a disadvantage during the frontline time, and it was a burden to bring a group of mobs. Hudson did not gather these armed forces, but the situation is different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reversal of the initiative on the battlefield, the resistance armed forces scattered in various places, suddenly became active. Many strongholds with weak enemy forces have been attacked by resistance forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these people hadn't come out to contact them, Hudson would not have known that there were so many armed forces hidden in the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the quality, there are hundreds of thousands of resistance armed forces added up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the data alone, it can be seen how weak the control of the Ancient Remnants Alliance over the place is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it's no surprise that this happened. The Warhammer Kingdom has millions of square kilometers. How could it be possible to take care of it with just the little army of the Ancient Remnants Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a genocide, it is impossible to kill all the people in just a few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no danger to defend the area on the plain, the nobles and the people basically ran away, and there were only sporadic resistance organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic lords in the mountains received the news a step late, and missed the best time to run, so they could only stay and resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to keep the city, they drilled into the ravine. Most of the resistance armed forces persisted in the mountains and forests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, these people had no news. They didn't know that the army of elves had swept the Three Kingdoms of the North Sea, otherwise they would not have been so active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct consequence of the wolf smoke everywhere is: cut off the hope of the ancient survivors alliance to gather defenders from all over the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, just received news that the Elven Air Force airdropped a batch of food to the enemy, which once caused chaos in the enemy camp.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson didn't respond. It is not the world of science and technology. In the era of cold weapons, the materials that flying mounts can carry are limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much the elves help, the supplies that can be transported are still very limited, and they simply cannot meet the daily needs of hundreds of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send an order to let the Griffin Dragoons continue to stare at the enemy camp, and find out as soon as possible whether the elf air force also took some of the elf wounded when they left.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that the reinforcement of the Elven Air Force was not as simple as it appeared on the surface. It was very likely that the Elf Legion in the coalition wanted to withdraw from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mature race must learn to stop losses. The alien coalition forces on the Warhammer Great Plains not only lacked reinforcements, they also suffered from severe food shortages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the food shortage is even more serious. If this problem cannot be solved, sending reinforcements rashly is irresponsible to the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It wasn't just the city walls that collapsed, but also the confidence that the orcs had struggled to hold on to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash, no return!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The half-orc general yelled hard, and even hacked two rout soldiers to death with a knife. However, since the defeat occurred, it cannot be reversed by manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the Frankish soldiers rushed in and quickly captured the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the situation is over, the half-orc king had to abandon the royal city and carry out a strategic shift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy's offensive is too fierce, Your Majesty, you should go first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are in charge of breaking the back, otherwise no one will be able to leave. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The half-orc guard commander said calmly, as if everything was taken for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harem who were crying and crying, also bid farewell to the orc king at this moment, and spontaneously joined the team of the broken queen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows how much effect    can play, but if everyone gathers together, they will definitely not be able to escape the pursuit of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A friend in adversity sees the truth. Although the contemporary half-orc king is not a generation of arrogance, he is also a qualified monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was in the Northern Continent where the human race was weak, it might be able to do something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that he was unlucky and became a neighbor with the First Kingdom of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in strength cannot be made up simply by hard work. Although they have worked very hard, the Frankish Kingdom is on the rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at everyone with nostalgia, the orc king stepped on the monster and escaped from the large army under the guard of dozens of masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is news from the front that the army has breached the orc palace and is currently clearing out the remnants of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the city was too chaotic, and there was no Orc King left behind. However, General Bakshi has already sent someone to chase after him, and I believe there will be good news in the near future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Duke Bergson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The level of civilization of the half-orcs is not high. There are only a few cities in the whole country, which concentrate the industry and commerce of the whole country, and the rest are rural tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's capital is already the last city controlled by the half-orc kingdom. After taking this place, the civilization of the half-orc family was directly beaten back to the tribal era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation of the half-orcs was smashed, and the main force of the half-orcs was wiped out. There is no suspense in the follow-up war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fighted well, the Ministry of Military Affairs drafted a commendation document, and approved the military exploits as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the frontline generals to complete the purge as soon as possible. There are still too many orcs! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III spoke the most ruthless words in the calmest tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing has long been familiar to everyone. As an indispensable item in previous continental wars, it is nothing more than a slightly larger scale of this cleansing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the barracks full of evil spirits, the Forest Elf Queen frowned. This is not the life the elves want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, as one of the few races in the alien alliance that maintains the offensive, the elves play the role of savior in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the alliance was defeated, the elves still had the power to settle down, but that was ultimately based on the intensified internal fighting among the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the human race suddenly unifies one day, or even only unifies the northern continent, it will bring them a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balance strategy is not fun, especially for small clans to play balance among big clans, it is even more risky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a low-level strategy, as long as there are other options, no one is willing to pin the survival of the race on the continued infighting of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sister, the situation is very bad for the Alliance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The half-orc kingdom was defeated too quickly, and we didn't even have time to complete the North Continent offensive. If we knew this, we should send troops in advance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grassland Elf Queen said with annoyed expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the fault of empiricism. The longer the longevity of the race, the more conservative it is. Relying on the skill of \"paddling\", the elves can benefit from the continental war every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that when encountering a continental war, their first reaction is: let others fight first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the strategy is, it will be eliminated sometimes. After experiencing the continental war, the human race became stronger and stronger, while the alien alliance became weaker and weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After one increase and one decrease, the balance was finally broken. The \"paddling\" strategy went bankrupt, and the elves had to take up arms and go to war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's meaningless to say these things now. No one thought that the strength of the Franks would grow so fast, and before they had time to do their best, the half-orcs collapsed ahead of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we send troops ahead of schedule, the war in the southern continent is still beyond our reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the half-orc kingdom is now collapsing, and the pressure on all parties in the alliance will be great. No one can be sure where the free Franks will target their next attack! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elf queen said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the Frankish Kingdom, joining any side of the battlefield can change the outcome of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the life of the alien alliance was not easy, but now there is such an uncertain factor, the pressure on those in power is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not only is there a lot of pressure, I think they are going crazy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order for us to send troops as soon as possible, these guys put forward a suggestion in the letter: We need to negotiate peace with the Alpha Kingdom first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of reasons listed, it seems that if we don't compromise with the Alpha people, we just don't care about the overall situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night elf queen complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of geographical location, the elves have always occupied a favorable position in the alliance, and everyone begged them to send troops every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only this time the situation is different. The situation was rotten, but everyone was not worried about them continuing to paddle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's nothing surprising. The tragedy in the half-orc kingdom has already frightened them. When life and death are at stake, who cares so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, under the current situation in the mainland, it really can't be dragged on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the establishment of the alliance, the half-orcs were the first core members to be destroyed by the human race, which dealt a heavy blow to the morale of all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't act quickly, there will be a second, a third soon, and the situation will really get out of hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just didn't expect that the Alpha Kingdom, as the most staunch anti-alliance country in the human race, actually has contacts with all parties, and can let them come forward to help negotiate peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, the human race is not trustworthy, and everyone is a decent person. When dealing with them, you must be careful! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Queen of the Forest Elf finished speaking, all the elves joined the troop of complaints one after another, spraying the human race with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Curse the curse, the issue of negotiation is still on the agenda. It is true that the human race wants to destroy the alien alliance, but when it comes to subdividing countries, their respective interests are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the Alpha Kingdom does not want the alien races in the central and southern regions to perish. Without these alien constraints, the pattern of strong in the south and weak in the north will further intensify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most pitiful thing is that the alien races in the northern continent cannot be destroyed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the victory in the Continental War, the Terran Alliance will indeed provide support to the countries of the Northern Continent, but this support is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for them to put all their efforts into completely destroying all the alien races in the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the high-level leaders of the Alpha Kingdom who are overly crisis-conscious naturally want to protect themselves first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great cause of the human race to unify the continent is not in a hurry for the time being. It may be a better choice to complete it in the next continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Tucao meeting got further and further away, and gradually deviated from the topic of the discussion, the forest elf queen had to interrupt: \"Stop!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These issues will be discussed later, but for now let's discuss the situation on the Warhammer Plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is aware of the situation. Our useless allies have reached the end of their rope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no reinforcements, I am afraid they will collapse in a short time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sister, what you said is not accurate. Even if reinforcements are sent, they may not be able to persist until the reinforcements arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to support those bastards, we have already built a magician regiment and a full-scale army. We did not have such a big loss when we destroyed the three countries in the North Sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alphas are difficult to deal with. If they continue to reinforce, some troops will only increase casualties, and will not be effective at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the current Warhammer Great Plains, in addition to the 30,000 expeditionary army, there are also 80,000 troops sent by the Mosi, and hundreds of thousands of defeated soldiers left by the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coupled with the command of a famous mainland general like Hudson, it is not easy to defeat them. If we don't make a move, even if the Alliance of Ancient Survivors transfers all the Southern Expeditions back, it may not be able to win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To ensure nothing goes wrong, we must dispatch at least five elite legions. If you want to reduce losses, it is best to dispatch an army of 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention whether we can mobilize so many troops to go there, the current situation of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors can't last that long!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, there was a large-scale dispute over eating the corpses of allies. If Doris hadn't handled it decisively, they might have started fighting themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to keep the Ancient Remnant Alliance, then quickly negotiate with the Alpha Kingdom and ask them to recall Hudson back to the country. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night elf queen said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that she has lost all confidence in the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overwhelmed by tens of thousands of enemy cavalry. He has been led by the nose from beginning to end, and has never grasped a strategic initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to say that the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants has no strength, it is obviously unreasonable. From the perspective of individual combat effectiveness, the soldiers of the ancient survivors are generally higher than human soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the expeditionary army is elite, it is not comparable to ordinary human soldiers. When encountering ancient soldiers, they will only hit two at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, when the number expanded, the strength gap between the two sides widened sharply. The expeditionary army can easily overwhelm the enemy army several times its own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is not because the soldiers are bad, but because the officers above are useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the high level to the grassroots level, the quality of the officers of the expeditionary army is much higher than that of the alliance of ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These shortcomings cannot be made up for in a while. There is a racial barrier, even if the elves want to send someone to help them reintegrate the army, there is no room for maneuver.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then start negotiations with the Alpha people as soon as possible. No matter how useless the Ancient Remnants Alliance is, there are still hundreds of thousands of troops in their hands. If they tap their potential again, they can mobilize hundreds of thousands more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will be more occasions to fight in the future, and having them join will also reduce the losses of the clansmen. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elf queen said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that using allies as cannon fodder is a very ordinary thing. There was no trace of guilt on her face. It's a completely different role from the amiable queen in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A qualified leader must put the interests of race above all else. Just leave the warmth to your family members, and you must show your iron and blood side to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the expeditionary army camp, Hudson is busy receiving representatives from all walks of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the ancient survivors were almost driven to a desperate situation by him. In recent days, every day there are stragglers who ventured out of the main force to look for food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Helping the Warhammers \"recover lost ground\" is a political slogan, but judging from the current situation, the slogan seems to be becoming a reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in recent days, various resistance forces have launched fierce counterattacks in various places, and the success of regaining lost ground has never been broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the situation improved, so did the troubles. After a round of war reshuffle, the original interest groups of the Warhammer Kingdom have been lifted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one mentioned the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms. Those who are active on the battlefield are basically nobles from the Western Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by geographic location.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    West Warhammer Kingdom is mountainous, and in the war years, the mountains are their natural barriers, allowing them to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the unlucky ones of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, most of them are still on their way at this moment, and only a few nobles with quick responses have arrived at the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A major reshuffle in the military will inevitably lead to political changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old aristocrats are unwilling to let go of their former interests; the newly rising aristocrats will not easily hand over the territory in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most powerful faction in the Warhammer Kingdom, in this round of struggle, Hudson naturally has the ability to influence the post-war situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wanted, he could bring a minor noble directly to the decision-making center of the Warhammer Kingdom. As long as the throne is not involved, there is very little he can't do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the dynasty is in power, it is natural that there will be a lot of guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits of door-to-door delivery are not received in vain. If you really don't accept the gift, these local snakes will be in fear instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war hadn't ended yet, he would have been even busier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things are not collected for nothing. As a nobleman with integrity, Hudson still gave everyone a \"return gift\" - a certificate of military exploits issued by the Northern Continent Allied Forces Command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also drunk. Before the outbreak of the Continental War, it was extremely difficult for Hudson to obtain the title of Marshal. Including the title of marshal awarded by the Mosi people, they were all traded back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the outbreak of the Continental War, without waiting for him to do anything, he won a bunch of marshal titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly after the great victory at Fort Augustus, he revealed that he would march westward into the Principality of Orton to prevent the elves from going south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Well-informed countries immediately took the most positive stance and appointed him as the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces at the Northern Continent Alliance meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether Hudson accepted it or not, the Marshal titles came one by one. All the efforts are only for one thing - hurry to block the army of elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real-time Hudson has pushed, but only accepted the nominal title. However, this does not affect his cashing in the name of the Northern Continent Allied Army Command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem like an inconspicuous piece of paper, but it is actually a recognition by the coalition forces of various powerful factions, and it is also the legal basis for their post-war struggle for interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving the gift was soft, and it did not affect Hudson's strategic deployment. It has been seven days since the enemy army was hanging, and even if the elven air force dropped food occasionally, the coalition army that couldn't fill their stomachs was on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order and let the army bury the pot to make food, and the enemy will be defeated tonight!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has come to this point, and Hudson is too lazy to hide. He still chose to attack at night, not because he likes field battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But a similar operation, he has played the enemy three times. Every time he made a posture of starry night attack, and after the enemy army gathered the determination to fight to the death, he resolutely chose to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuous tossing back and forth, but the enemy general who boosted morale suffers. \"Determination to fight to the death\" is not always available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood is boiling, and it is destined to be impossible to continue. Even if the soldiers want to continue, the hungry stomach will not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night gradually fell, and under the urging of the kings of various tribes, the soldiers forcibly raised their tired bodies to form an array, ready to meet the enemy at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yawned, the giant king said angrily: \"There is no need to wait any longer, this is another tactic of the enemy to exhaust the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called attack is nothing more than sending hundreds of cavalry to harass. If a general offensive is really launched, why should the enemy tell us in advance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we continue to toss like this, I am afraid that we will be tossed and crippled before the enemy attacks. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking in the direction of the Giant King's finger, a soldier fainted and was escorted into the camp by two soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the soldier on the left was out of state, and slipped his feet inadvertently, causing the three of them to fall to the ground together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There is no way, the sentries on duty are too tired and hungry, and their bodies do not allow them to remain vigilant all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get up and meet the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers on duty at night hurriedly urged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers who had just fallen asleep had to drag their tired bodies up from the ground. It's just that the speed of action is unavoidably slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most soldiers are ordinary creatures, mental willpower cannot overcome physical weakness. No matter how hard the officers yelled, they couldn't mobilize the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get up quickly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get moving, you bastards! If the enemy comes in, no one will survive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the giant king had already kicked three slow-reacting giants. It's just that the reaction he got was as slow as ever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the enemy comes in, no one will live\", this is clearly fooling the giant. A few days ago, there were giant captives who came out to persuade them to surrender!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the captives of various ethnic groups took turns to persuade them to surrender. It has been proved by actual actions that the expeditionary force does not kill prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was before, everyone would still be loyal to the race and fight the enemy to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after being tossed about by Hudson's \"Strategy of Weary Soldiers\", many soldiers now just want to have a full meal and a good sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrows, like a torrential rain, swept towards the defenders who had just lined up. This kind of treatment, they have not encountered for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is the expeditionary force getting supplies. With enough arrows to squander, you can fully display the power of the crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defenders have also worked hard. There are many more archery towers than ordinary barracks, equipped with a large number of archers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the advantage of being condescending, they fired at the expeditionary army, and they didn't lose the wind for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that a few war towers can't change the outcome of a war. Without the cooperation of the soldiers below, the archery tower was quickly taken down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous cavalry rushing into the camp, this time there are also infantry participating in the battle. The mosi's recruits and warhammers are indeed limited in fighting against armed forces, but it's no problem to follow the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the three-sided siege of the Northern Continent Allied Forces, the alliance of the ancient survivors who did not cooperate closely enough soon fell into the embarrassing situation of fighting on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doris, we meet again. It seems that the situation is similar to last time, but I don't know if your reinforcements will arrive in time this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the enemy has reinforcements, he knows better than anyone else. If he wasn't completely sure, he wouldn't bring his younger brothers along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars have never been determined by the number of troops. Bringing the little brothers along, on the one hand, it is to accept the gift from others, and on the other hand, it is to reduce the casualties of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trapped beast knows that it is still fighting, let alone the alliance of the ancient survivors. If it is really urgent, these small races can cause a lot of casualties to the expeditionary army if they work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a coquettish drink, Doris asked with a sullen face: \"Hudson, don't forget that the negotiation has already begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instigating a war at such a time, aren't you afraid that negotiations will fail and you will be held accountable? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the absolute high-level of the elves, negotiating with the Alpha Kingdom naturally cannot be hidden from Doris, let alone Hudson, the commander of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, usually after this kind of negotiation that is of great significance to both parties begins, everyone will exercise restraint to prevent the escalation of the situation from affecting the negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, what nonsense are you talking about, where did the negotiations come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that you elves want to surrender?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the case, I can promise you: as long as the nobles withdraw from the war, return the lost land, and punish the war criminals, the Northern Continent Alliance will not pursue follow-up issues. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to dig a hole for him. Since it is a secret negotiation, it must be kept strictly confidential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what the outside world thinks, anyway, Hudson must insist on the bright side: the Alpha Kingdom has not thrown off other countries and negotiated with the elves in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"rat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris cursed angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't been targeted, with her help, the elf army would definitely be able to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the situation is different now. The Northern Continent coalition forces are indeed encircled by three and lack one, but Hudson has always been scheming with his troops, and they dare not break out of the encirclement in a direction where there are no enemy troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, you are blatantly slandering me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the expeditionary army attacks, I follow the rules and write the gauntlet in advance. You even choose the location of the battle. How can you say that I am despicable?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't stand the cruelty of war, why start a war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall situation of the Great Plains of Warhammer has been decided, and continuing to fight is a meaningless sacrifice. I think you should let your men surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    End the war earlier, and you will be able to go back to take care of your children sooner. Fighting, killing and killing is really not suitable for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a laugh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with him, he did put down the gauntlet before attacking. It's just that the above content is a bit vague, and it's like saying nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum it up: You choose the location of the final battle, I choose the time of the final battle, and the next meeting will start directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you are courting death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Doris directly launched an attack. There are elements of becoming angry from embarrassment, but there are more of them out of necessity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the conversation, there were already more than a dozen powerhouses of the eighth rank quietly distributed around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that everything is reasonable because of the needs of the battle, but more and more powerful people are gathering here, and Doris still feels something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of the danger, she no longer had the heart to talk to Hudson. Once the encirclement is formed, whether she can leave today is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden magic attack was stopped by Maxim before it could get close to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Long also has a temper. He has always been the one who goes out to fight and cause trouble. When did he become the one who gets beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    was about to settle accounts with Doris, but the other party had already rode the unicorn sacred beast several miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this caution, Hudson knew why she was able to break through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sanctuary is certainly an understanding of the laws, but it also has high requirements for the comprehensive quality of all aspects of the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one's foundation is damaged in one's youth, no matter how deep one's comprehension is in the later stage, the body will not be strong enough to support a breakthrough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Infused with magic elements, it is full of danger. Many eighth-level powerhouses are in poor health, and forcibly breaking through the realm is falling at this step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, Maxim, is there still a chance to capture that woman alive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson secretly transmitted the voice channel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If she is captured alive, it depends on whether she is willing to cooperate. However, the two of us work together to kill her with 80% to 90% certainty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, what good is that smelly woman. You can kill it directly. If you like elves, we will go to the elf forest to help you catch them later. The storage is more juicy than this. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's words made Hudson half dead. After only so much effort, he has become a womanizer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really about lust, who can compare to the dragon?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's the estrus period, but the mother will go to bed when she sees her mother. In normal times, it's not much better. It is common to encounter female dragons drooling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, you are an idiot. Capturing the opponent alive is necessary for negotiation. Do you know how valuable a living Sanctuary powerhouse is? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how many masters there are in the elves, the sanctuary is still rare. Looking at the top power of the human race, we can see that, except for the few on the surface, the few in the dark are all suspected sanctuaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, several seed players in the Alpha Kingdom who have the opportunity to break through the sanctuary are currently in retreat. In order for them to successfully break through the realm, the whole kingdom is collecting treasures as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, whether it can break through and when it will break through are all unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the past situation, even if the concentration of magic elements between heaven and earth can support the body, in the early stage of the continental war, it is considered luck that the kingdom can give birth to a powerful sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the major kingdoms is similar. Usually, only in the middle and late stages of the continental war will there be a strong man in the sanctuary to appear and start the golden age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, this number will not be too much. Even in the age of ancient mythology, there was no such thing as walking all over the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Doris leave, Hudson vented his anger on the kings on the battlefield. If it weren't for these guys making trouble, the encirclement would have been completed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking down an elf sanctuary as a bargaining chip, just asking to sign a non-aggression treaty, is a 100% success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike now, as a weak party, the kingdom has been in a passive position in the negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the same is the king of the race, and the water in it is not generally large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For slightly stronger races, the kings are all eighth-level powerhouses; for some weaker races, many kings are weaker than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to enter the decision-making circle of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants is most likely due to the relatively large population of the race, which gained a place by virtue of its comprehensive strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Holiness has escaped!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who yelled, and the camp that was already in chaos was completely chaotic at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the spirit has been emptied, and the morale of the ancient survivors' coalition forces, which is already low, has completely lost their fighting spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having learned his lesson, the Giant King was the first to give the order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest guy gets the hardest beating. Reason told him that if he didn't run quickly today, the giant family would be removed from the Aslante continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, even if they escape this catastrophe, whether the blood of the giant family can be passed on is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the hole is opened, it can never be taken back. The strict military laws that were originally enacted to prevent deserters had no effect on established deserters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What makes Hudson unhappy is that the army of elves is gone. In the camp of the elves, there are only one hundred and eighty old elves left, where are they pretending to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army came over, and these old guys were also very bachelors, directly saying: Give the prisoners of war treatment in the Ten Thousand Races Covenant and surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason for initiating this campaign is to win enough bargaining chips for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to occupy a favorable position in the negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the enemies are gone, leaving only a group of old and weak. If you want to threaten the elves, you are probably dreaming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Alliance of Ancient Remained Clans, they are all a group of low-ranking small clans. If they are united, they can still cause a little trouble for the races, but under Hudson's operation, many seeds of conflict have been planted among the races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the shot just now, Hudson only caught and killed the determined anti-human king, and he deliberately released those peacemakers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys who have experienced severe beatings are full of defeatism in their minds, and they can only drag their feet when they go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they survived the continental war by chance, these small clans will be liquidated in the future. It's just that it wasn't Hudson who took action to liquidate, but the owner who would occupy this land in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms were restored, or whether they were occupied by the great nobles in the south-central region, has nothing to do with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the countries on the mainland to allow the Alpha Kingdom to expand its power here, and the Kingdom has no intention of expanding westward. Even if the war is won, the kingdom's guns will only go north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge against the orcs is second, and the most important thing is that the kingdom needs a stable rear. The bitterness of fighting on two fronts is enough to suffer once, and no one wants to come a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shouting and killing continued, but the battle gradually came to an end. The bright moonlight fell on the earth, presenting rounds of blood moons, followed by countless undead creatures popping up on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson realized something was wrong. What kind of military camp is this? It is clearly a \"gate\" leading to hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, Maxim, destroy the altar!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, one dragon and one bear immediately attacked the altar where the energy gathered. A group of powerful clansmen on the battlefield also shot one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien priest guarding the altar let out a strange laugh, followed by a loud noise, and the entire altar exploded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the explosion, like a forbidden curse, swept in all directions, frightening a group of powerful people to rush to intercept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the dust flying all over the sky, Hudson couldn't help sighing: \"It's really cruel!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that the enemy would actually set up a hidden altar in the barracks, using the dead souls of both sides as sacrifices to summon undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy's plan is to succeed, the expeditionary army will have to suffer heavy losses. It is clear that it is a lose-lose style of play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that although the enemy's plan was good, he didn't expect his own army to be so unbearable, and he didn't even delay it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the altar could gather enough energy, the Northern Continent Allied Forces came to kill them, forcing them to start the plan ahead of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The undead creatures attracted by insufficient energy are naturally not much stronger, and cannot cause a devastating blow to the expeditionary force, so they simply detonated the altar directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the explosion just now, at least hundreds of soldiers were killed and thousands were injured. If the enemy's plan succeeds, Hudson's unbeaten record will come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change created a favorable opportunity for the enemy to flee. It's just that Hudson has no time to care about these things, and his mind is full of thinking about who set this up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There seems to be something wrong with the Alliance of Ancient Survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many races inside, such a decision cannot be passed in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation of the altar, the enemy's preparations are still a bit hasty. If some sacrifices are prepared in advance to shorten the time for energy accumulation, the effect will be better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elves, very likely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With their profound background, it is completely justified to have this kind of formation of mutual destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with their special status in the alliance, it seems that it is possible to lay an altar under the banner of deploying a magic circle to deceive the kings of various races with limited knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or it was done by some races in the Alliance of Ancient Remnants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, those who preside over the sacrifices are all people from the ancient survivors. Without the participation of the race behind them, it is not easy to find a group of dead warriors to sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or the elves colluded with some ancient survivors to jointly plan this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the fog, Hudson didn't think deeply about it. Sometimes being too serious is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of miles away, the negotiations between the elves and the Alpha Kingdom have also come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of bargaining, the two parties reached a preliminary agreement, and the non-aggression treaty will come into force only after the high-level officials of both parties sign the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, an elf broke into the venue and asked the delegation…\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it doesn't matter, it's definitely impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this non-aggression treaty is what both parties need together, and the results achieved in the negotiations cannot be abandoned because of past disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this news, Earl Francis could only express his regret. Who made his marshal too good at fighting?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally agreed to promote peace and put pressure on the elves, they never expected that the battle would be over in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Ancient Remnants has hundreds of thousands of troops in Hancross Province. No one expected that they could be defeated so quickly under the condition of wholehearted defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the predicament faced by the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, it is a pity that Earl Francis is a civil servant and he has no interest in the battle process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle reports of the expeditionary army will not emphasize these things, some are just soldiers fighting the enemy bravely, and the commander uses his troops like a god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Francis, you are really calculating!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the murderous words of the elder elf, Earl Francis waved his hand calmly, and said indifferently:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Priest Meg, the battlefield is ever-changing, and all kinds of accidents are possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the progress of the negotiation between us is too slow. If the contract is signed in advance, this kind of thing will not happen. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the negotiations can be tough, after all, depends on the performance on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle was fought before the signing of the treaty, so this kind of behavior is naturally not a breach of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a truce during the negotiations, it is still a matter between the Alpha Kingdom and the elves, and does not include the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If allies are included, negotiations cannot proceed. At the same time, the elf army did not stop invading southward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one needs to blame anyone in this regard, the competition is still strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since this is the case, there is no need to talk nonsense. We will sign the contract directly, and then let the high-level officials of the two countries sign the agreement. The agreement will be considered effective.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priest Meg said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has become an established fact that people cannot be resurrected after death, and the bereaved have suffered heavy losses. Rational diplomats will naturally choose to accept the reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem. However, Your Majesty, I want to make a statement here:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the treaty is signed, the kingdom's troops will withdraw from the Warhammer Great Plains, but this does not include local resistance forces and troops from other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has no power to force its allies to give up their land. It can only restrain their behavior as much as possible, but the final result is not guaranteed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are favorable conditions on the battlefield, and as a diplomat, you must fight for the corresponding rights and interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Warhammer Great Plains that was recovered with great difficulty must not be spit out directly, otherwise the Terran Alliance will not be able to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic center of gravity of the Alpha Kingdom is in the northern border, and it has no ability to occupy it for a long time. It is undoubtedly the best choice to let the allies manage it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of interests can be discussed after the war. As the most powerful country in the Northern Continent, the kingdom still has enough right to speak at its doorstep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the situation is unfavorable in the future and the city is lost again, it cannot be blamed on the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war ended, and Hudson became more and more busy. It is necessary to arrange for people to chase and kill the rout to expand the results of the war, but also to be busy dealing with post-war affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most critical issue is the ownership of the Warhammer Kingdom. After an invasion by foreign enemies, the establishment of the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms was smashed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleeing nobles want to come back to regain power, and the armed forces that have risen amidst the chaos of war want to turn the results of their battles into long-term benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The irreconcilable conflict between the two parties will be the main conflict in the Warhammer Kingdom. The situation had just improved, and there were signs of tension between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fugitive aristocrats were formerly vested interests, and were best at political struggles. Now they have begun to move around to win external support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emerging power faction is a little slower to respond politically, and they haven't thought of that much yet, but they have soldiers in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the exiled nobles who have become bereaved dogs, the biggest advantage of these people is that they are in the country and have contributed a lot in the process of \"recovering the lost land\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the size of the force, people have sent troops after all, and have formed substantial control over the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson was born in a veteran aristocrat, then there is no doubt that he will support the exiles. Maintaining the unshakable traditional order is the duty of every veteran nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is purely grassroots, he must support the emerging group. The path of a lone traveler is destined to be short-term, and more people must be found to form a group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sadly, Hudson is somewhere in between. He is a rising noble, but not a rising noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Promoting civilian officers and sending them into the aristocratic circle is just to boost the morale of the army and set an example, it does not mean that he is about to jump out and play revolution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the large and small resistance forces in the Warhammer Kingdom are also mixed with fish and dragons. There are not only those led by the children of big nobles, but also those led by small and medium nobles, and most of them are armed by civilians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, the aristocratic armed forces, the predecessors of the civilian armed forces are various civil organizations such as merchants, mercenary groups, caravans, assassin organizations, thieves alliances, and a few grassroots heroes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal components are too complicated, which directly leads to the inconsistency of their interest demands. Most groups only focus on their own one-acre three-point land, and rarely consider national issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has tested these groups, except for a very few organizations that are considering the future of the Warhammer Kingdom, the rest don't think that much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people even naively thought that as long as they gave Master Hudson a gift, their future status would be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking money to do things has never had a bad reputation in the aristocratic circle. What everyone is afraid of is that they don't do things for money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the money is not only for Hudson himself, but for the entire expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the property looted by the Alliance of Ancient Remnants in the Warhammer Kingdom was left in the strongholds in various places. The expeditionary army did not have the time to clean up one by one, so they could only resist the armed forces cheaply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most bitter and tiring battles were fought by the expeditionary forces, and the richest spoils were taken away by resistance forces, large and small, which is obviously unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is land, it is inconvenient for officers and soldiers of the expeditionary army to reach out, but everyone must share the floating wealth!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a gift in name, but it is actually a distribution of spoils. Anyone who knows a little bit about the world knows how to prepare a generous gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are not aware of this will have no future. Without the proof of military exploits presented by the coalition command, their efforts would be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The establishment of a new dynasty in the future will only recognize well-documented military exploits, not their own oral military exploits. Unless more favorable evidence can be produced, for example: the head of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, for a group, the military merit converted from the first level looks great, and once it is separated, it is not worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the military exploits that participated in large-scale battles that affected the fate of the kingdom and even the human race and made a certain contribution can be covered by more members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter where you are, you can't escape the essence that there are too many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For their own political purposes, the battle had just ended when all parties approached Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exile faction wants not to recognize the military merits of the resistance armed forces, or not to make a public statement in this regard; the resistance armed forces hope that he can reward him for his merits in advance, and divide the territory before the new government is established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides are very generous, and even made a promise: After the event is completed, Hudson himself can obtain a provincial fiefdom from the Warhammer Kingdom, and the two provinces can be negotiated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for his sanity, maybe Hudson would have agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the background of the power vacuum in the Warhammer Kingdom, Hudson, the commander of the coalition forces, is the supreme commander of the local area. In theory, he can represent the power of the king and the government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being capable does not mean being able to do it. Acting as a monarch is always taboo. Not only his own king will be unhappy, but all the veteran nobles will also feel jealous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a big commotion, it will attract hostility from the royal families of various countries in the mainland. Even if they really want to do it, at least they have to support a puppet king in the foreground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not going to develop in the Warhammer Kingdom. Even if he gets a large and fertile fief, it will be useless without a population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A weak country has no dignity. Instead of being a powerful minister in the Warhammer Kingdom, it is better to return to the Alpha Kingdom and be a prince, at least you don't have to clean up the mess every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the current Warhammer Kingdom a mess?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other kingdoms are worried about the appearance of powerful ministers, except for the Kingdom of Warhammer. Regardless of whether it is a strong monarch or a powerful minister, they are not picky now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a powerful figure to balance the interests of all parties, the Warhammer Kingdom is likely to further split.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson's good friend, King George said: can help neighbors take care of part of the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This move was also secretly supported by his own king. According to the pre-agreed conditions, Caesar IV also had a share of the expanded land of the Principality of Moxie in the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as the core figure of the plan, the benefits of Hudson are also indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific distribution ratio of the three parties: 4:2:1.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This \"4\" is not only for George alone, but also includes all the dignitaries in the Principality of Moxi. To complete this plan, the Moxi people need to devote all their efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the ratio of investment to income, Caesar IV received the largest cake, and he only pulled the line once from beginning to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The work was done by Hudson, and Caesar IV was not deeply involved. Even if something happened, it had nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, who will let someone be the king?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the participation of Caesar IV, even if the benefits were shared, Hudson would have no way to eat it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interest share is small, but the royal family is responsible for the coordination of the territory. The meat obtained from the Warhammer Kingdom was transferred to the interior of the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, after the war, the Principality of Moxi will transfer part of the land bordering the kingdom to the queen's name as an increased \"dowry\"; Hudson will receive the royal family's territory in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specifics still depend on the income situation. Generally speaking, the more meat the Principality of Moxi eats, the bigger the cake the royal family gets, and the more compensation Hudson can get.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the plans of the two camps of the Warhammer Kingdom are doomed to fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is even more impossible to reconcile the contradictions between the two parties. If they don't become chaotic, how can the Principality of Moxi continue to expand? If the Principality of Moxi cannot expand smoothly, how will Master Hudson's income be guaranteed after the war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to clear the way for the expansion of the Moxi Principality, Hudson was also worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for worrying about arousing the vigilance of all parties, he would have wanted to let the Moxi army take over the cities in various places in the name of the coalition command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wanton takeover of the city did not happen, but the main strategic areas, all staged a scene of assisting defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Raquel, according to the current plan, the progress is really too slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the expeditionary force to stay in the Warhammer Kingdom for a long time, and you still have to rely on yourself later. The excuse to defend against the counterattack of the Ancient Remnants Alliance can only fool them temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the elves are now determined to go south to rescue the alien alliance, so it is impossible to send the Southern Expeditionary Army back north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the army goes south and enters the central continent, the major factions in the Warhammer Kingdom will definitely ask you to return the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is friction because of this, it will be of no benefit to us if it leads to a human race alliance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by information asymmetry. I thought that after being baptized by the alliance of the ancient survivors, there should not be many living people in the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never thought that these alien races are unreliable. When destroying the ruling foundation of the Warhammer Kingdom, so many fish that slipped through the net were left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to deal with the nobles in exile, just label them. The lord is responsible for guarding the land, and if he is thrown in the territory to lead the people to run away, he can directly deprive him of his noble status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resistance forces remaining in the local area are different. Even if the city is lost, the people are still resisting. If the responsibility is pursued, the meaning of targeting will be too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have really tried our best. Now I have recruits in my hands, and their combat effectiveness is slightly stronger than that of these local miscellaneous armed forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he suddenly turned his face, he might be powerless to control the Warhammer Kingdom. Of course, if the Expeditionary Force can help...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Raquel finished speaking, Hudson immediately interrupted: \"Get rid of this unrealistic idea as soon as possible, it is impossible for the expeditionary force to intervene in this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, when the benefits are distributed after the war, the kingdom should take the lead, so what else is there for you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to turn your face, you can't do it now, you have to wait for the expeditionary force to withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want you to speed up, not for you kid to poke Lou. In many cases, solving a problem does not necessarily have to be aimed at the problem itself, but also the person who created the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guiding these resistance armed forces and exile nobles to fight is just one of the means. A better way is to turn the enemy into one of our own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, more than half of the resistance forces in various places are led by civilians. Although many of them are descendants of nobles, they are civilians without titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What this means, you should be very clear! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoning the kingdom and cooperating with the Principality of Moxi in private is essentially for profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, participating in the game as an individual, Hudson can get one-seventh of the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom is brought into the arena, not to mention the international conflicts it will cause, even if he really grabs a big piece of cake, how much can he get?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two dots, or three dots?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to have more. There are so many nobles in the kingdom, and everyone has contributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The essence of this war is that everyone is ordered, and Hudson is the commander. After sacrificing a large number of noble officers and soldiers, they won the final victory. When dividing the spoils, they cannot be thrown away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is for the kingdom to go north with all its strength, go to the northern prairie to compete with the orcs for the chassis, and compensate all parties with the benefits of the feud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the Warhammer Kingdom will become a private matter. If you fail, you bear the risk yourself, and you keep the benefits in your own pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the nobles in the country broke out, the royal family would share the pressure. Without concrete evidence, how can the combination of \"king + marshal\" fail?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, do you mean that the Principality grants them titles in exchange for their allegiance?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not impossible, but very possible. It is not easy for commoners to become nobles, especially this kind of large-scale group crossing classes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before becoming nobles, ordinary civilians are loyal to the lord, and the obligation of the lord to flee automatically disappears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Re-choosing the allegiance of the monarch, there is nothing wrong with the law, and no one will criticize them for betrayal, and there is no pressure from public opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi extended an olive branch, 99% of the civilians would not be able to resist the temptation to become nobles. Even if the leader refuses to agree, the people below who want to make progress will help him make a decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no monarch in the Warhammer Kingdom, and no one has the right to confer noble lords before the king ascends the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is discovered by the nobles of the Warhammer Kingdom, the conditions they can offer are nothing more than retainers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are choices, and everyone is definitely willing to be loyal to the monarch directly, instead of acting as retainers of the great nobles and letting people make a difference in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Raquel, I didn't say anything. What you want to do is your country's internal affairs. As a foreign minister, you have no right to interfere.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He dared not admit to such a proposal that risked the disapproval of the world. Otherwise, after returning to the kingdom, he would not be able to mix well in the noble circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen George's audacity, Hudson would not have given such advice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't hurt to have a lot of debts, and you can even use inherited knowledge to pay off your debts. It's not a big deal to confer a group of commoners into nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After receiving Hudson's reminder, Raquel reported to the capital without even thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing, let the high-level principality have a headache!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although, as a child of a veteran aristocrat, Raquel hates this kind of breaking the rules, but compared with the principality's strategy, it is acceptable to occasionally break through the bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, is the Principality of Moxi still breaking through the bottom line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the orc invasion, the Principality of Moxi has passively started the \"top-down improvement road\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With repeated changes again and again, the original political system has long since changed unconsciously. The current thinking of the nobles has changed from adhering to tradition to surviving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing external expansion is essentially because the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi were frightened by successive wars and had no sense of security at all. The sense of crisis drove them to find ways to strengthen their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the many strategies to enrich the country and strengthen the military, the plan that has the least impact on everyone's interests and is the easiest to succeed is naturally external expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Focusing on the Warhammer Kingdom, it was because this neighbor was in decline, and a group of dignitaries foolishly packaged themselves up and sent them to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, once the two sides officially turn against each other, they can deal with the high-level leaders of the Warhammer Kingdom as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think of the frontline's suggestion on conferring nobles?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George deliberately changed the concept and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem with conferring nobles. This is an indispensable activity after each war. But wantonly canonizing commoners as nobles is another matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to sensitive topics that challenge unspoken rules, even the king will inevitably have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, now is the best time to expand westward. It is worth paying a price for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom is a big country after all, no matter how it declines, it still has some strength. If it is not handled properly, the subsequent rule will be very troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the appetite of the local powerful faction is not great, it is also a good choice to take the opportunity to draw them into the Principality. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins took the lead in supporting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bottom line is for breaking through. It is undoubtedly the best choice to use non-violent means to encroach on the territory of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is worthwhile to cause some controversy for this. It's all the internal affairs of the principality, as long as the face is thick enough, it will be laughed at at worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, all countries are busy with continental wars, and it is beyond their reach to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Earl Martins is right. It's just a promotion to the nobility, we just go as usual.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg opened his eyes and told nonsense without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war destroyed not only the old order, but also the original household registration information. As a victor, modify the data, and the commoners and serfs will become fallen nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many nobles dead in the Warhammer Kingdom, it is only natural for them to inherit their titles as relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an extra procedure, which is a game within the system. The children of the nobles are loyal to the Principality of Moxi, and the canonization of them as nobles is completely in line with the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, we meet again.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a way that he thought was kind, he greeted the other party, but as expected, he received a blank stare. Hudson was not angry at all, because the other party came to sign the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides reached an agreement, but there is still a lack of mutual trust. In order to ensure that the treaty can be fulfilled, according to the prior agreement, the high-level officials of both parties must sign the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the military leader of the kingdom, Hudson naturally couldn't escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the contract document, it has already been signed by dozens of high-level officials of the kingdom and the elves, including the elf sanctuary in front of him, who is also on the list, and now Hudson is short.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the content of the contract, and after confirming that there was no problem, Hudson directly signed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment the pen fell, he felt a mysterious force falling on him, and suddenly the mysterious compass in his body moved, as if trying to break free from the shackles of this force, Hudson hurriedly intervened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is good to break free from the shackles of the power of the contract, but it must not be now. Doing things in front of other sanctuary spirits is too contemptuous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, both the kingdom and Hudson need to stabilize the elves. As for the follow-up question, we will talk about it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was signed this time was only a non-aggression treaty, and there was a Principality of Moxi between the two parties. Under normal circumstances, there would be no fight at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi will also be forced to sign a unilateral promise: a treaty not to send troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength and the right to speak are equal, and the elves can calmly talk to the Alpha Kingdom, which does not mean that they will give the same treatment to the Moxie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson, the contract has come into force, you should let him go.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doris said as calmly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the days when the two were in contact, she had been suffering. If it weren't for the fact that there are still many clansmen in the prisoner-of-war camp, she wouldn't show a good face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Doris, it is impossible to release people, but you can meet them first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, the work of guarding the prisoners has been handed over to the resistance forces of the Warhammer Kingdom. For specific matters, you can communicate with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors have frequently appeared. The prisoner-of-war camps have been attacked many times, but we have stepped up our guard and must ensure the safety of the prisoners of war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said imperceptibly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to release people, the only way to take people out is to rob the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the expeditionary army has captive elves in their hands has long been known to everyone, so they can't just disappear without knowing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who loves his feathers, doesn't want to leave a stain on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Farewell!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Doris turned and left. The meaning of not waiting to be seen was directly revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled slightly. It's best not to wait and see, it's not a good thing to get too close to high-level people of different races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the kingdom's secretiveness, there will definitely be a day when it will be exposed in the future. At some point the time has come to settle old scores, and there has never been tenderness in politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deeper the blend, the harder it will be to get out in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of threat not only comes from abroad, but may also come from home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of secrecy, only a few high-level officials in the kingdom know about this plan. The rest of the kingdom's nobles had guesses at most, but they were not sure what exactly happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, everyone could understand that this was \"for the kingdom\". After the war, many people will deliberately pretend to be confused and use this as an excuse to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a quarrel broke out, King Caesar IV was certainly the first to bear the brunt, but Marshal Hudson would inevitably be criticized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heroes during the war, sinners after the war, this happened not once or twice in human history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a powerful faction, Hudson is not worried about being liquidated, but things like stains can be avoided, and we should avoid them as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the expeditionary force will return home tomorrow!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actors of all parties are in place. If he, the coach, does not leave, the Warhammer Kingdom drama will not continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a deserted manor, several high-level members of the Tegusta resistance organization gathered to discuss the future of the organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How about it, do you think the Moxi people's promise is reliable?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader Baxter asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a mercenary, he has always dreamed of becoming a nobleman. But after really working hard, he realized how unreliable this idea was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am working hard, and others are not idle! The children of the nobles are all internally involved, so there is no room for outsiders to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military merit canonization, just listen to it. If you want to gain military merit, you must first win the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that in the past few years, except for the civil war among its own people, the kingdom's army has been beaten and fled around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victory or defeat on the battlefield cannot be changed by a small soldier. Joining in is nothing more than cannon fodder +1.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about licking blood, working for the nobles, it's better to be a mercenary, at least you can earn more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the development of the situation that pushed him to the foreground, Baxter would never have dreamed that he would be able to pull up an army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lack of vision, the sequelae are revealed at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the moment of life and death, everyone has no extra thoughts. He came out to lead the resistance organization, so naturally there will be no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the gradual improvement of the situation, the future fate of the group must be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After fighting with gold and iron horses, and wanting everyone to go back to be serfs who don't have enough to eat and don't wear warm clothes, it's hard for everyone to get used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, no matter whether he is real or not, you must try it. As long as you are willing to ennoble us as nobles, it doesn't matter if you work for them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible for us brothers to risk our lives to build a foundation, just to take advantage of that son who can only flee for his life…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he was still apprehensive, and when the words came to his lips, Scarface still forcibly swallowed them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the separation of the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms, the two succeeding princes were both empty monarchs, and the power directly fell into the hands of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two unlucky kings have fled for their lives in exile without having time to do a single business since they succeeded to the throne. Naturally, their reputation among the people has fallen to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's okay to think about it in your heart. Everyone is still very cowardly when they publicly accuse the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who dare to point at the king's nose and scold them are \"warriors\", and more ordinary people are still full of awe of the king's power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, Scar is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people wooed us, and at least they promised to knight us. When the time comes, brother, if you become the lord, we can also get a knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representatives sent by the domestic aristocrats and lords look arrogant all day long. Apart from shouting loudly, they have no fart ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How come our brothers also killed many alien races, and also regained a lot of lost land for the kingdom. When rewarding meritorious deeds, we should also be rewarded with a title!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    God **** tax exemption for ten years, bullying us as if we have never seen money. Incorporating into the regular army is even more nonsense, as far as the army of the kingdom is concerned, I feel ashamed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behave well, you can become their retainer, I bah!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously they want us to work hard for nothing, and they don't want to give benefits. If you really become their vassals, wouldn't everyone's military exploits be theirs? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The skinny young man yelled angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the conditions offered by the Warhammer nobles are not low. Under the current system, there is only so much they can offer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knighthood?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That was purely overthinking. The puppet king launched by the Warhammer nobles, after receiving the news of the great victory of the expeditionary force, \"falled into the water and died\" in a moment of excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is busy fighting for power and profit, and there is no time to investigate the cause of the accident for a while. They are all puppets anyway, just replace them when they die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with doing things this way, but the rules still have to be followed. Without the king's permission, he promised to be a knight without authorization, and he put on a rebellious hat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best condition that can be given is to accept him as a retainer. The retainers are also nobles, but the nobles conferred by the great nobles have much lower gold content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually in the territory of the great nobles, they can obtain the same rights and interests as the nobles; but outside, all kinds of political power do not have their share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people give you face, they will admit that you are a nobleman. If you don't give face, you will be an ordinary commoner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the lord lord divides the fiefs generously, the political status will still not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"But they want us to rob...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Baxter could finish his sentence, Scarface said first: \"Brother, if a robber joins a gang, he has to submit a certificate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brothers have not accomplished an inch, why can the Moxi people canonize us as nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that after completing the task, the highest can be canonized as a viscount, that is, you can get a city + fiefdoms of several big towns!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, do we brothers want anything? For the prosperity of the rest of my life, I have to fight no matter what. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After passing the steel defense line, even if you return to your homeland, you don't know how far the domestic situation has developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order to let everyone speed up. At this critical moment, we must join in the action to regain lost ground! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the sad look between his brows can't be concealed no matter how much he does. Once he stumbled and hated for thousands of years, if he had known that he could counterattack and regain the lost ground so quickly, he would not rush out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reality has no medicine for regret. Under the circumstances at that time, neither the East nor the West Warhammer Kingdom could see any hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original estimate, the entire Northern Continent will fall in sevens and eighties, at most, the remaining provinces of the Alpha Kingdom will persist until the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to preserve the strength of Fuguo, they had to order a retreat to preserve their vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persevering plan and reality will always be separated. During the retreat, the kingdom's army collapsed first, and a large number of defeated soldiers mixed with refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you can successfully evacuate, a little change is nothing. It's a pity that the Moxi people stabbed them at a critical moment and forcibly recruited the defeated soldiers who had fled in exile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was gone all of a sudden, and their bargaining chips for restoring the country were also lost. It was too late to appeal to the Terran Alliance, and the era of the big counterattack came again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change of the situation forced them to strengthen diplomatic public relations while reorganizing the army to return home to fight for dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the operation was half successful, and the diplomatic and public relations progressed very smoothly, and all parties expressed their support for their restoration of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the army, there is no need to think about it, it has long been sent to the front line by the Mosi people as cannon fodder. Even if you want to withdraw, you cannot withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, they are also worried about forcibly withdrawing the army, causing the collapse of the front line, and being responsible for destroying the coalition forces' resistance to alien invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a hurry, he pulled out a disfigured army from the refugees, and hurried back to China to participate in the power struggle. Borg really didn't know the bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, uneasy must also go. Under the banner of fighting against other races, the Moxi people kept urging them to go, even if they wanted to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally a marshal who was highly respected by the people of the country, but because of the previous evacuation, he was notorious and lost the hearts of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the armed organizations that remained in the Warhammer Kingdom's resistance did not have any favors for these fleeing dignitaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enemy attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden rain of arrows from both sides stunned the team instantly. Isn't this place recovered? How can there be enemies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing the enemy clearly, Marshal Borg's expression changed drastically. Wherever there are alien races, they are all human races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was politically minded, and he realized the danger in an instant. Subconsciously asked: \"Who are you, why did you ambush us?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What greeted him was a fiercer attack from the enemy, and no one answered his questions at all. Obviously, this is a group of enemies who don't understand the rules of the nobility, and don't even want the most basic etiquette.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the weapons used by the enemy to attack, Marshal Borg quickly recognized that this was the standard equipment of his kingdom, and the identity of the incoming enemy was also clarified, properly resisting the members of the armed organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal power struggles are often more intense than external ones. Unfortunately, it is normal to block someone's way and cause a fatal disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't follow noble rules, but the enemy is not noble! Maybe one day they will come out to defend the rules, but that will have to wait until they become nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You bastards, you actually provoke internal fighting at this time, are you afraid that the kingdom will not be destroyed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Roaring cannot solve the problem. From the moment of action, the two sides will not stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Full of anger, he was mobilized. At this moment, he didn't think so much, and he wanted to kill all the enemies in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At almost the same time, the nobles returning from abroad were all attacked similarly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that their whereabouts are under the control of the enemy. No matter which way you go, you can't escape this catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people escaped by chance, but many more fell on the battlefield forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the few victors, after defeating the enemy, Borg sat decadently in a pool of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hands were covered with blood, which meant that the internal fighting in the kingdom had further escalated, and there was no possibility of relaxation for all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know, even when the Eastern and Western Warhammer Kingdoms were in conflict, no one engaged in an ambush like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you must cheer up, otherwise what will the kingdom do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The persuasion of the middle-aged officer made Borg smile bitterly. The more you know, the more troubles you have in your heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cohen, the situation is completely out of control. These resistance armed forces dare to rob and kill us, which means they regard us as mortal enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can see the eyes of the enemy soldiers. Perhaps in their eyes, we deserters are the cancer of the kingdom and must be cleaned up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we entered the mountainous area and insisted on resisting, the situation may be quite different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has already declined to the extreme, and now it is still fighting endlessly. We are afraid that we will not be able to go on the road to the restoration of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have a hunch that there is still a force behind these people planning. Otherwise, they would never have the guts to do so!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, the enemy's conspiracy has already started. Perhaps since we entered the Principality of Moxi, we have been caught in a huge conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all my carelessness. When His Majesty falls into the water and dies, he should be vigilant! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Borg gave himself two big mouths. He was able to ignore such an obvious flaw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king fell into the water and died. This was the first time such a **** thing happened in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened for the first time, and two people died at one time, and they happened to be on the same boat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, everything looked normal. After all, those two unlucky kings were all their carefully selected waste snacks, and they did not do less to die in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it carefully, there are flaws everywhere. The guards who were on duty to protect the king happened to be landlubbers who couldn't swim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the accident, it was the Mosi people who rescued the two hapless kings. The person did not die on the spot, but the Lord of Dawn that he met during the treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's right, the two unlucky ones both died of krypton therapy. The priest who rescued him came from exile together, and Borg knew them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have no motive to kill the king, so the problem lies with the Mosi who rescued the king ashore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything is guesswork out of thin air. No problem was found at that time, and it is too late to investigate now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the two unlucky kings are both puppets, and they ascended the throne in a hurry, and they have not had time to be recognized by the mainland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one would have thought that someone would assassinate these two puppets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, could it be that you are thinking too much. If the mastermind behind the scenes is an Alpha, why is the expeditionary force evacuating in such a hurry?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged officer shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nonsense, I also know that they are not Alpha people. If they really had ambitions for the kingdom, they wouldn't have withdrawn all their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that there are Mosi people, their ambitions may not be smaller than Alpha people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't explain it, but once you explain it, everyone will not believe it. Isn't it a joke that the little Principality of Moxi dared to plot against the Kingdom of Warhammer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after laughing, everyone's expressions changed drastically. Where is the Warhammer Kingdom now? There are only two grassroots teams and a bunch of messy warlords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A flock of dragons without a leader can still dominate; but a flock of sheep without a leader cannot resist the prying eyes of wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, they are currently playing the role of sheep. No matter who is in power now, they cannot convince the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the prestige has been lost, and Marshal Borg, who once promised everything, has lost his appeal at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best option is to quickly introduce a king and establish diplomatic relations with various countries. The most appropriate legally is undoubtedly the abdicated Joseph II.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this person was kicked out by everyone, and if he is put on the throne again, it is because the kingdom is not chaotic enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Changing candidates, as soon as the idea came up, Borg couldn't get rid of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is the selection of the king. He alone has no say, and he must win the support of the major factions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my mind, I pulled out all the members of the royal family, compared and screened them one by one, and Borg was soon overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of candidates for the puppet king, but I can't find anyone who can clean up the current mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are no elites in the royal family, but that these elites had accidents due to various reasons in the previous infighting.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Losing the restraint of the expeditionary force, the major factions have started a crazy infighting mode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the resistance armed forces from all over the country joined forces to overthrow the exile faction, and then there was a split within the resistance armed forces, with grassroots factions and noble factions fighting non-stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, the shadow of the Moxi people must be behind this. If there is no external provocation, even if there is a conflict, it will not intensify so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in the previous war, countless veteran nobles have been eliminated, leaving a large piece of unclaimed land for everyone to divide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of this has anything to do with the returning Hudson. For the Warhammer people, infighting is a terrible thing; but looking at the whole continent, it becomes a small disturbance not worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The international influence caused by it has not been as high as the rescue of the captives by the elves, and it has received a high degree of attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's just attention, the Warhammer Kingdom is in a state of anarchy, and all parties don't know who to turn to if they want to protest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was like the wind when it came, but it turned into a snail when it went back. It's not that the quality of the expeditionary force has declined, it's mainly because there are too many spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not many things were seized directly, but there were not many gifts received. Hudson didn't eat alone, it was a military practice to share the profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to transport the trophies, everyone's poor horses are now pulling carts. Not only did the cavalry become infantry, but they also had to work part-time as civilian husbands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transport your own loot, no matter how hard or tiring it is, no one complains. Everyone has a lot of big and small bags, and on the surface it seems that the harvest is similar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference lies in the value. The more outstanding the military exploits, the higher the value of the spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trophies of officers and soldiers at the bottom are mostly practical. Cloth, salt, tea, gold coins...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Hudson also worked **** the distribution of spoils. In the case of meeting actual needs, be as fair and equitable as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, urgent report on the northern line!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received the battle report, glanced at it roughly, and Hudson said blankly: \"Got it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was startled, thinking that something big happened, but he didn't expect that he had lost a line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The line of defense created by temporary rush work is not bad if it can be used, what else can I ask for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose it, you will lose it. From the northern border to the southern border, the kingdom still has countless lines of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire in its heyday had no way to break through the kingdom's defenses in a short period of time, let alone now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rich experience of being beaten allows the Kingdom's army to always preserve its vitality to the greatest extent when the line of defense is lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Data don't lie. A line of defense held back the orc army for more than a month, losing 40,000 troops, which Hudson could fully accept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is serious water in these figures. It is said that the enemy army was delayed for more than a month, and the time for the enemy to actually launch an attack must be much shorter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is sure that the orcs have no idea at the moment, but if they want to keep the newly recovered prairie, they have to continue this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to his original vision, the orc empire would invade the kingdom with all its strength, and the newly recovered provinces in northern Xinjiang would all fall, placing the battlefield on the territories of the five northern dukes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not to cheat teammates, but the five dukes are often beaten, they are the most experienced in facing the orc invasion, and the fortifications in the territory are also the most complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the newly recovered provinces are not good enough. The development time is too short, the infrastructure is not perfect, and the battlefield is placed there, and logistics is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson's quick victory on the western front, the pressure of the two fronts was superimposed, and the kingdom would not last long at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army moved forward slowly, as if it was completely unaffected by the defeat in Northern Xinjiang. It's just that Hudson can sit, but it doesn't mean that all the northern Xinjiang nobles can also sit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from ordinary human countries, the Alpha Kingdom's handling of lords' lost cities and lands is extremely strict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous orc invasions, countless noble lords died on the battlefield, not because they couldn't run, but because they couldn't run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The killing of the orcs is a test of life and death for the noble lords in the border areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar IV was in a state of sorrow and joy. He had just received the good news of the truce on the western front, and a letter of plea for help from northern Xinjiang came to him like snowflakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Expeditionary Army, how long will it take to reach the capital?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Expeditionary Army\", this special army, has placed high hopes on the kingdom since its birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the Kingdom made the right move. Relying on the high mobility of the elite cavalry, they quickly defeated the alliance of the ancient survivors, deterred the elves, and laid the foundation for the signing of the non-aggression treaty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are only direct impacts, causing even greater indirect impacts. After the Warhammer Battle of the Great Plains, the countries' judgment on the strength of the Alpha Kingdom was once again invisibly elevated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally due to the serious injury after the war, the international status that fell, suddenly came back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Heroes\" are always vulnerable to special attention. In particular, the expeditionary army was assembled from private armies of various families, and the royal family was the main force among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearly 30% of the officers and soldiers in the expeditionary force came from the royal family. It can be said that the elite children of the younger generation of the royal family are basically stuffed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of each family is similar. They have sent their best children to experience it, and learn how Hudson uses soldiers by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the illustrious military achievements of the expeditionary army, they actually cared more about the safety of their own children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the battle report issued by Hudson earlier, there was only one death toll, and the identity of the deceased was not introduced in detail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, according to the current speed of the expeditionary force, it will take about ten days to reach the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look, do you want to urge them to speed up? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that the expeditionary army has gained a lot is no secret in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own children are also in the army, and there is a high probability that they are also one of the vested interests. Naturally, no one will criticize this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the slow marching speed, it is also acquiesced by everyone. What's more, after such a long period of high-intensity combat, it's time for the expeditionary force to rest and reorganize, and they can't waste the elite just because they are on their way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, they have a lot of luggage, so the marching speed should be slower, just slower!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV waved his hand and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they came back, their speed was less than half of the speed when they went out. The expeditionary force can be regarded as setting a record, which is completely contrary to the normal march of \"returning like an arrow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV was able to not panic because it was time to reap the fruits of victory on the Western Front, and it was not unacceptable to temporarily lose the sparsely populated poor provinces in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not the same as other great nobles, and they can bear it. In addition to letters of appeal for help, it is inevitable to start public relations in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no need to worry about the issue of rewards for the expeditionary army. But the situation in northern Xinjiang is imminent. Since the war broke out, we have fallen to thirteen counties, and many strategic locations have been threatened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earls of Oran, Albert, Doug, and Forbes in the border area...all sent urgent letters for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander-in-chief of the front line, Marquis James, also sent a letter for help, claiming that the defense line deployed by the Kingdom in the border area is far from meeting the needs of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to his estimation, if there is no more reinforcements to join the battle, in the next three to six months, the kingdom will lose the seven northern provinces again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purely from an economic point of view, the seven provinces in northern Xinjiang have made a direct negative contribution to the kingdom, and the central government has to allocate funds for relief every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the accounts are not calculated that way. The Alpha Kingdom has a total of more than 30 provinces, and losing seven provinces at once, no one can afford the political impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If such a tragedy really happened, then the emerging aristocratic group that had just risen would definitely suffer a devastating blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political structure of the kingdom will definitely be impacted. The old aristocrat's right to speak has been further strengthened, and Hudson is the only one left among the emerging aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem with self-protection. If you want him to balance the power of the old nobles alone, then there is no need to fantasize. It is even more likely to jump ship directly and join the old noble camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the internal camp confrontation in the Alpha Kingdom is not that sharp, and the boundaries between the old and new aristocratic groups have always been blurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has also been inherited for thousands of years, and Hudson has made up for the shortcomings of the inheritance. As long as you have a thicker skin, you can also join the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the whole country mobilized?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the orcs invade in an all-round way, the Alpha Kingdom will mobilize the whole country. It stands to reason that this time will be no exception, but the reality does not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic materials raised by the kingdom at the moment are far less than in previous wars. If there is a nationwide mobilization, the biggest problem is how to solve the logistics of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly recovered seven provinces in northern Xinjiang are all poor. The local industrial economy is almost zero, and the food production is difficult to support themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that it is to provide food and supplies for the army, it is not bad if it is not hindered. Maybe the kingdom will have to take out valuable strategic materials to rescue the refugees caused by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, absolutely not!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation has not reached that point yet, and the national mobilization has too much influence, so it can only be the last choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of this war, in the past month, the kingdom has added another 3.86 million gold coins to its budget deficit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of money can still find a way, but strategic materials cannot be changed. There are wars everywhere now, and it is difficult to buy enough strategic materials even if you have money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have done our best to raise supplies. The material consumption of the more than 500,000 troops on the front line alone drove the whole kingdom to go crazy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado cried bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the high positions in the Alpha Kingdom, the most difficult one is the Ministry of Finance. It seems to have a high position and weight, but it is actually a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either filling the hole, or trying to find a way to fill the hole. From home to abroad, their creditors are everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever the night was quiet, the bald Marquis Delgado wanted to let the finances go bankrupt instead of just putting it to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of thing that has been infamous for thousands of years can only be thought about in the end. If you really want to go bankrupt, you can't appear in your own hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the ministers of the kingdom, Marquis Delgado submitted the most letters of resignation. The resignation letters contributed by one person exceed the sum of the heads of various government departments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Caesar IV succeeded to the throne, he once wanted to replace this preoccupied old man, but after gaining a deep understanding of the kingdom's finances, he finally dismissed this dangerous idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, Marquis Delgado was able to close the gap without causing financial collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you change to someone with poor ability, you might be overwhelmed all of a sudden. This kind of shocking hole, Caesar IV will be scared when he sees it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Delgado is right. Given the current situation in the kingdom, if we really mobilize the whole country, we can only last for more than five months at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially, the road conditions in these seven provinces are worrying, which increases the logistical pressure. According to the estimates of our Ministry of Military Affairs, maintaining the current strength on the front line is almost the limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice now is to let the front line hold on for a while, and then go to the front line to fight the enemy after the expeditionary force finishes resting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the opinion of Marshal Hudson! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero echoed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he knows the soldiers well. The situation on the front line is indeed dangerous, but it is not time to collapse immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the Human Race Alliance, it is a miracle in itself to be able to support 500,000 troops to fight on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what the two ministers said is very reasonable, but we have to consider the demands of the frontline nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we cannot send reinforcements in a short period of time, can we consider replacing with a strong commander? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice of the Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, fell to the ground, Caesar IV understood it instantly. Originally, I wondered why these issues were so controversial. The relationship was just acting for him, and the real purpose was to change coaches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hasn't even arrived in the capital yet, so he was assigned a new position so quickly. The Marquis James, who needs to be sacrificed, happens to be his confidant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Objection is impossible. The most powerful people in the court have unified their positions, and the local nobles have also made demands, and the king has no way to stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't give Marquis James a chance, it's because he can't win the battle! No matter what the reason is, if you lose, you lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with a defeated commander, everyone is more willing to believe in Hudson, who beat the orc to doubt his life in the last battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the performance of Marquis James was not bad, he was able to keep the main force of the Kingdom's army when the enemy was strong and we were weak, but he couldn't stand the comparison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is a taboo for military strategists to change the commander in the middle of the battle. Moreover, Marshal Hudson has just finished a battle and needs time to adjust and rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force that has just returned to China also needs to restore its combat effectiveness, and it is also inseparable from Marshal Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, let Marquis James continue to serve as the commander-in-chief of the front line, and wait for Marshal Hudson to finish handling the affairs of the expeditionary force before taking over the command of the front line. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV strives for Tao.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After working hard for such a long time, he still had to return to zero in the end. His heart was broken. However, his performance on the front line made him lack the confidence to support Marquis James.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gaining time at this moment is also the last struggle of Caesar IV. If Marquis James can win a big victory on the front line, he can also gain some military say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After everyone looked at each other, they agreed. It can't be compared with Hudson, but compared to other generals in the kingdom, Marquis James has at least the experience of commanding hundreds of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the last war, he followed Hudson as the deputy commander, and after the war, he served as the commander of the standing army. He still has very rich experience in leading troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, everyone does not want the Hudson family to dominate. The current embarrassing situation is only due to the lack of candidates to check and balance.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

We will definitely send troops to support when the battlefield situation improves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    South Shore Kingdom: The Three-Eyed Clan is too powerful, we can only barely resist, and want to send troops to support you, but we have more than enough energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi Principality: The previous battle suffered heavy losses. We are defending against the counterattack of the Ancient Remnants Alliance.

When it came to specific support, no one was willing to contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that countries don't have a big picture, it's just that the elves army is not easy to mess with. Especially the prestige of the elven magician group resounded throughout the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forbidden spells flying all over the sky may be a bit exaggerated, but when it comes to the battlefield, it is definitely not justified if you don't get a few forbidden spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless all countries work together, no single human country can afford such a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the current situation, the Frankish Kingdom is the only one that can spare their hands, and the Holy See is at most half. Because they wanted to use the war to pit their teammates, the performance of the Holy See army on the battlefield was a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the top forces of the two families join forces, it will be no problem to clean up the elves. But the loss that needs to be paid will definitely not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of a false name, it is obviously not in line with human nature to take out the wealth of the family to fight the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia Palace, looking at the thick request for help in his hand, Charles III is now very headache. Compared with other countries, the excuse of the Frankish Kingdom is too clumsy after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knew that their war with the orcs was coming to an end, so it was obviously unreasonable to refuse to send troops on this ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Frankish Kingdom is not the most powerful country on the mainland, and does not have such a large influence in the Human Race Alliance, then it will be done if it is done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See, which also has spare power, is not panicking at all now. It doesn't matter if it has a bad reputation on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom can't do it. As the leader of the Human Race Alliance, they still have to show some face. Charles III must consider political influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most troublesome thing is that the Frankish Kingdom still has an enclave in the North Continent, which happens to be in the way of the elf army, and the local lord also asked him, the boss, for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The obligations of the monarch and his subjects are mutual. While the vassals are loyal to the king, the king must also protect the interests of the vassals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely not acceptable to sell the younger brother directly. Once this precedent is established, the loyalty of the nobles to the king will inevitably be affected, and the vassal system of the Frankish Kingdom may be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't keep it, at least you have to make a gesture of doing your best to fulfill the obligation of the monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of overall national strength, the Frankish Kingdom is no weaker than the elves. If there are no other forces, it doesn't matter to directly start an all-out war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now the two sides are one south and one north, which belongs to the kind: it is no good to win, and it is a **** game to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To fulfill the obligation of being a monarch, you must send troops for reinforcements. If the number of troops sent is less, that is to send heads; if more troops are sent, the kingdom cannot bear the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Now that all countries are unwilling to contribute, and it is impossible to talk about organizing coalition forces, what do you think should be done?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I knew it was such a hot deal, I shouldn't be greedy for that little tax, and let the enclave of the Northern Continent become independent. Nothing happened now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation in the Northern Continent is beyond recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Warhammer collapsed, the Three Kingdoms of the North Sea fell, the Principality of Orton was destroyed, and the Principality of Moxi was seriously injured. Except for the strength of the Kingdom of Alpha, there is no longer a strong country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, there was a wave of outbreaks in the Alpha Kingdom, which almost disabled the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants, but it was only a flash in the pan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orcs launched the northern invasion, they had to concentrate their forces to defend the northern border, and they were powerless to stop the elves from going south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counties of Ruilin, Grint, and Nadal are all small countries. Korubia has been annexed by the Hessians long ago, and none of them are useful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining areas, except for the two enclaves of the kingdom, are all enclaves of other great nobles. Judging from the current situation, they are obviously ready to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to survive alone, even if Wang Guo is willing to spend all his money, it will be difficult to hold on to those two enclaves now, so it's better to just give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened that the kingdom destroyed the half-orc kingdom, obtained a large area of ​​land, and directly transferred the local lords back to let them pay off the half-orc tribe. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Duke Bergson suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed bullying for the noble lord to abandon the well-developed cultivated land and instead manage a piece of raw land, but the current situation is special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of elves is about to reach the door of the house, and if they don't run away, they will have no chance to run away. It is indeed a disadvantage economically, but compared with Xiaoming, it is not worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the noble lord and the king agree to change the fiefdom, other people will naturally have no objections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a group of nobles came back to grab the cake, it would be better than dragging the kingdom down the endless abyss for a fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really a fight with the elf army alone, no matter what the final outcome is, the Frankish Kingdom will be a loser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the prime minister is right. There are only two enclaves, and it is not worth our trouble at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is actually a good thing for the kingdom that the elves take action to rescue several foreign families in the Central Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After digesting the land left by the half-orcs, the strength of the kingdom will surely be further improved, and the strength gap between countries will be further widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the kingdom, what it needs most now is not to defeat the alien alliance, but to end the continental war as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the human race is not defeated, the sooner the war ends, the better for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to end this war before the Kingdom of Iberia solves the cannibals and the Holy See solves the dwarf king! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jesús made an ambitious proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marquis **** has long been dissatisfied with the current international situation. It's just that under the restraint of all parties, the Frankish Kingdom did not dare to break the balance rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now is undoubtedly the best opportunity. Once his plan is completed, the situation on the mainland will definitely develop in a direction that is beneficial to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By annexing the Frankish Kingdom of the Orc Kingdom, it will be able to throw off its competitors in one fell swoop and become the only existence on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    International competition has always been slow step by step. Once the Frankish Kingdom turns its strategic advantage into strength, it will be difficult for countries to catch up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Charles III nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let's do this! By the way, tell the lords that when they evacuate, the generals will also be brought with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To develop the land left by the half-orcs, the kingdom still needs a large population. Not only their leaders, but also the war refugees from the Northern Continent would be brought back if conditions permit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister, organize the kingdom's fleet to pick it up. Let the navy **** everyone, and we must ensure the safety of the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, send someone to communicate with the elves to make it easier for them. As long as the conditions are not too excessive, you can agree to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war belonging to the kingdom is about to end, and the domestic business control can also be appropriately relaxed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first kingdom on the mainland, every move of the Frankish Kingdom will affect the direction of the situation on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III's words may seem ordinary, but they actually represent a strategic change in the Frankish kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the final liberalization of trade control, it is short of publicly expressing support for smuggling trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal trade of the human race has not been interrupted by the war. The so-called trade control is just to prevent strategic materials from flowing into the hands of foreign races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Capital is greedy, wherever there is profit, it will go there. It is conceivable that after the Frankish Kingdom relaxes its crackdown on smuggling trade, how many strategic materials will flow into the hands of foreign races in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even for strategic purposes, the Frankish Kingdom may secretly and directly provide material support to certain alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar operations have not happened in human history. It's just that they were all in peaceful times, and no one was foolish enough to support foreign races during the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III dared to do this, the core factor is that the alien race is weak, and now it can no longer threaten the dominance of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the performance of the various races during the war, it can be seen that many alien races are declining, and the only ones whose strength has not been affected are the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, everyone knows the shortcomings of the elves. They still have a detached status if they don't participate in the war. Once they are involved in the continental war, the family wealth they have painstakingly accumulated will be wiped out sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they have made great progress all the way, but the price behind this is that tens of thousands of elf soldiers will fall to the ground forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost more than 10,000 soldiers in the Northern Continent, how much will be lost in the Central Continent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think that the three kingdoms in the mainland are not fighting well. It is mainly because they are preserving their strength and trying to use war to consume the power of small vassal states.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stimulated by the elves, the performance of the armies of the Three Kingdoms on the battlefield has been raised to a new level in an instant these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the loss of hundreds of thousands of troops, even a loss of 50,000 to 60,000 troops would be enough for the elves to suffer for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight for hegemony on the mainland, you must first solve the low birth rate of elves. Otherwise, the leading brother of the alien alliance can only work hard to keep the mainland peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the Xueyue Lake, countless orcs drove their cattle and sheep and gathered here, making final preparations for the all-out war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The front line was fought very well, and the enemy's first line of defense was taken down without paying much price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the past practice, Alpha's first pass is the most difficult to win. As long as this level is passed, the follow-up war will be much easier to fight. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Jin Jin gets the most suitable stage, he can immediately glow with his own light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    learn from mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering from fighting independently, the Orc Empire has also undergone changes in military command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel, who had outstanding military exploits, quickly stood out from the crowd of generals and became the commander-in-chief of the army appointed by the five emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel lived up to expectations. After taking over the imperial army, not only did the attack speed increase, but even the casualties of the troops also decreased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My son is so good at fighting, so I am naturally happy to be my son. As for the blemishes of indifference and lack of sociability, they were directly ignored by the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you look at a person pleasing to the eye, the disadvantages can also become advantages. This is the current situation, the original short board has now become \"the arrogance of the emperor\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rule of the game of the Orc Empire is Mu Qiang. Duke Daniel's outstanding military performance directly made him squeeze out the previous brothers and become the heir of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result came a bit suddenly. Even Daniel didn't expect that he, who was not liked by the nobles in the clan, was miraculously won the support of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was forced out. After being chased and killed by the human race all the way, and driven into the barren land, the rich and powerful realized that if they want to enjoy a luxurious life, they must first let the race survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel, who was the best at fighting, suddenly became a favorite. The former cold-faced duke directly became a \"lonely emperor\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other four royal families don't care about holding back and stabbing the knife now, so they should work together to eliminate their own threats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not enough to destroy the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, the old enemy of the Alpha Kingdom must also be severely damaged. Otherwise, with the Alpha Kingdom taking the lead after the war, maybe with the support of the Human Race Alliance, the Seven Kingdoms will fight back again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the high-level executives of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms ran away completely, and these guys are backed by powerful forces. With a little help from one family, there will be an army to restore the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is not enough, the enemy's main force is still there. Now that the Western Front is over, it won't be long before the most elite expeditionary army of Alpha will appear on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not as easy to fool as James. Since he entered the army, he has never been defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current strength of the empire, it is only slightly stronger than the enemy. But they are on the defensive side, relying on the advantages of fortifications, they can basically wipe out our advantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Daniel, what are you going to do next? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have a solid family background, you can't mess around. The current Orc Empire wants to defeat the Alpha Kingdom without compromising too much strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then hurry up and fight the enemy ahead of time before Hudson arrives. Don't worry, the enemy has fallen into the trap and is now waiting to close the net.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was thinking of waiting for the expeditionary army to come and swallow them together. But judging from the current situation, I am afraid that there is no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also good, to save too many fish and burst the net.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, the empire will regain all the land lost in the previous war. No matter how powerful Hudson is, he has to have soldiers in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is limited to severely inflicting damage to the Alpha Kingdom. If you want to destroy them, it may be difficult to achieve with the strength of the empire! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daniel said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of others, being able to break through the enemy's strongest first line of defense so quickly is already a remarkable victory, but Daniel is not satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After one or two months of tossing, only one line of defense was taken down and tens of thousands of enemy troops were wiped out, which is simply weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this style of play, the war will evolve into a war of attrition in the middle and late stages. The current Orc Empire doesn't have so much cannon fodder available, and if it is consumed, both sides will suffer.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

What's more, there are negative teaching materials from allies to set off, making it even more difficult to win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is very satisfied. Apart from the coach Hudson who benefited from the brilliant victory of the expeditionary force, all the princes and nobles also benefited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military merit belongs to everyone. The children of each family who practiced together not only accumulated a wealth of combat experience, but also made a lot of military merit by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the death rate of elite children is low. Except for a few unlucky ones, the direct descendants of each family basically returned in triumph.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson deliberately took care of them, but these people were already protected by experts arranged by various families. In the case of constantly winning battles, as long as you don't kill yourself, you basically can't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the small casualties are relatively speaking. When the 35,000 army went out, there were only more than 26,500 people left when they returned, and the battle loss rate was close to a quarter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heavy casualties do not mean a decline in combat effectiveness. After a series of victories, the expeditionary army has also displayed its own military spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop there casually, everyone knows that these troops are elite, and the exposed aura is so strong that they can feel the murderous aura even if they are hundreds of meters away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, all the high-level leaders of the Alpha Kingdom came out of the army, otherwise they would have to make a fool of themselves on the spot after being so provoked by the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson obviously felt that Caesar IV had lost his composure, but he concealed it well, and few people noticed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the triumphant ceremony was over, it immediately entered the celebration part. It's really not easy. Since the outbreak of the Continental War, this is the first time the kingdom has held a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the protagonist of the banquet, Hudson not only failed to feel like a fish in water, but was exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enjoyment to be worshiped by others, especially to be worshiped by the opposite sex. However, a beautiful noble lady is very eye-catching, and a group of beautiful noble ladies surround her, that is to suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Hudson is so rich that he has no blessings to enjoy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, a group of officers under his command had more fun at the banquet, and some powerful guys even hooked up with noble ladies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also a high-risk job, which is a test of eyesight. If you provoke someone you shouldn't hook up with, the consequences will be very serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Most of the noble ladies who surround Hudson asking questions are not to be provoked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either the princess of this family, or the young lady of that family. Those with low status cannot be squeezed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this situation did not last long. After satisfying everyone's curiosity, the crowd dispersed quickly. After all, a married noble like him does not belong to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For an affair, you must first consider whether you are willing to pay the price. Many things in the aristocratic world have their prices marked in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson, you came out so soon. How come there are so many ladies and ladies in the capital, but none of them can catch your eye?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the voice of teasing, Hudson was depressed for a while. Now he is the sweet pastry in the eyes of many people, and they all want to come up and take a bite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't know where the other party is coming from, how dare he mess around. Since ancient times, there have been countless heroes who were destroyed on the bed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, how can I answer what you said?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the princesses of princes and noble families, this Princess Madeleine is the real princess of the kingdom, the sister of Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they met last time, the gap between the two sides was too big, and Hudson could only watch from a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone can talk together, but this is not the reason to make friends with him. According to the practice of the continent of Aslante, Princess Madeleine should marry a king or heir of a certain kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is not married, with his current status, the royal family may marry for the purpose of winning people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also a small probability event. The object of royal marriage is first of all birth, and the royal families of various countries in the mainland can more or less be related.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely not a good thing for two people who should not be friends to mix together. In case there is any scandal that affects the royal marriage, Caesar IV must turn his face against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You men are all womanizers!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Princess Madeleine's words, Hudson almost spilled the wine in his hand. Using this method, trying to get his attention is too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, if this is the case, I will take my leave first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson turned and left directly. A royal princess is not worth his time to study.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no love and hate for no reason in the world. He can't believe that Princess Madeleine, who has been educated by the royal family for a long time, is a silly white sweet who came to him simply out of curiosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was so easy to attract her, then everyone should have met at the last celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is value. Intuition told Hudson that the Alpha royal family was not peaceful, otherwise Princess Madeleine would not be so reckless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to make friends, you don't have to be so eager. Especially in the way of attracting men with women, which is very easy to cause accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happens, the unmarried Princess Madeleine will suffer far more than he, a married nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that you can't get married. With the national strength of the Alpha Kingdom, royal princesses are always in demand, but the marriage partner is likely to change from the king and heir to an ordinary prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, how are you?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the maid sounded, Princess Madeleine frowned, and said with a depressed face: \"Before I had time to say anything, this guy slipped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he is more cunning than we expected, and if we want him to stop this marriage, I am afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Born into the royal family, while enjoying a superior life, you must also pay a corresponding price. The price to pay for being a royal princess is marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of marriage is not only a marriage between the royal family, but also involves national politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, on the issue of marriage, the right to speak of the parties is not as good as that of the domestic ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although an important minister like Hudson cannot decide who the royal family will marry, he can destroy the royal family's marriage plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, if this is the case, things will be troublesome. The ministers in the DPRK and China basically support this marriage. If Marshal Hudson does not object, it will be difficult for us to stop it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really marry that bastard, you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the maid could finish speaking, Princess Madeleine interrupted: \"Things are not that bad, my brother is also against this marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation in the kingdom, our need for this marriage is not that urgent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers want to promote this marriage for the benefit of the kingdom, but it does not mean that they can force their elder brother to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Marshal Hudson, this man is too shrewd and not as easy to handle as those ordinary noble children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What I did just now was obvious enough, and it didn't move him. You can't really ask me to seduce him, can you? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raging fire cut through the night, and the earth-shattering shouts of killing awakened the defenders from their sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What happened, so how can there be enemies?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Theoren asked in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These questions, obviously no one can answer him. With the northward expansion of the kingdom's territory, Zijingguan has changed from a frontier to an inland area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former military fortress has now become a material transfer station for the army, and a large number of strategic materials come in and out here every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to insufficient preparation, the kingdom's defense line in the border area is not as strong as before. The strategic materials hoarded in the castle fortresses in various places are not as much as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of materials, the Kingdom hoarded a large amount of strategic materials in fortresses far away from the front line, and Bauhinia Pass was one of the important strategic materials hoarding places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, everyone is ready to fight and retreat from the very beginning, and each line of defense has its own mission. As long as there is enough delay, just retreat directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Hudson became the commander-in-chief of the kingdom, the death-knocking has ceased to exist, and the strategy of exchanging space for time has been implemented instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of the first line of defense in front caused an uproar. It was because the loss was too fast. According to the kingdom's plan, they should persist for three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turmoil subsided quickly because the kingdom had prepared enough lines of defense. Losing a few lines of defense will not affect the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each line of defense is built on favorable terrain, not only easy to defend and difficult to attack, but also happens to block the enemy's way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pass the line of defense, there is a risk of being cut off from the back. Leading hundreds of thousands or millions of troops to fight, no one dares to leave the rear to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal situation, Zijing Pass is still three to four hundred miles away from the front line, and the flames of war will not burn so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is very embarrassing. Although I don't know what exactly happened, it has become a fact that the enemy army has entered the city anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Theoren, who calmed down, hastily ordered: \"Hurry up, call the troops in the city to organize a counterattack immediately, we must keep the Bauhinia Pass!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what happened, but the pass cannot be lost. Otherwise, not only will there be problems with the army's food roads, but even the rear will be cut off by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a serious crime to let what should be your own fortification become the enemy's fortification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it was too late. The raging fire lit up the whole city, and the smell of meat was emitted from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Theoren, who stepped out of the headquarters, was ashamed, it's over, everything is over! The countless strategic materials that the Kingdom had hoarded at Zijing Pass turned into raging fire at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he could keep the pass and lost tens of thousands of tons of strategic materials, the kingdom would not spare him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, he would have grabbed Lord James by the neck and asked him why he had let the enemy in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Endless anger turned into a single word, and Earl Theoren, who knew he was helpless, picked up the knight sword and led his guards to join the moonlit night fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shame can only be washed away with blood. At this time, either annihilate the enemy army and salvage the burned strategic materials as much as possible; or directly wrap the corpse in horse leather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, Beitlun Port, hundreds of miles away, was also attacked by orc cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that as the port that the Felix family mainly operates, the performance of their family's private army is better than that of the defenders at Bauhinia Pass, and they didn't realize it until they were killed by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc masters who descended from the sky robbed the city, but were stubbornly resisted by the defenders. Although it was still unable to stop it in the end, it bought time for the defenders in the city to gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every minute and every second on the battlefield is precious. Organized defenders and unorganized defenders are completely different concepts of combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel, who personally directed the raid, stared at the battlefield indifferently. Obviously, his heart is not at peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This cross-border attack actually learned from Hudson. It's just that in terms of use, he changed it flexibly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using the weak defense behind the enemy army and the cover of night, let the cavalry cross the defense line on the border, go straight to the strategic point behind the enemy army, and launch a surprise attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good ports in the north are limited, and even fewer have been developed. Beitlun Port is the only large port developed by the Alpha Kingdom in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said unceremoniously that after taking this place, the difficulty of transporting strategic materials on the northern route of the Alpha Kingdom will directly double.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cut off the transportation of strategic materials and destroy the hoarding of strategic materials. This is obviously an attempt to trap the defenders on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is what has to be done. According to the upright style of play, the orc empire may not be able to take much advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Alpha Kingdom is defeated, if their own strength is severely damaged, they will be powerless to stop the restoration of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have personally experienced the strength of the Human Alliance. Daniel is very clear that the current orc empire is no match for the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Use all the magic scrolls traded from the elves!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making this decision, Daniel also secretly felt pain. Using magic scrolls as siege supplies is a proper prodigal style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in order to hurry, he didn't care so much. For this attack, not only the main force of the cavalry was mobilized, but all the masters of the orc empire were also mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that this is a gamble. If the defenders on the front line of the Alpha Kingdom find out, the infantry who stay in place will be in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unlikely that the entire army will be destroyed, but heavy losses will certainly be inevitable. If it wasn't for the fact that the five emperors were fooled into sitting in the rear by him, and the game was to kill first and play later, this kind of battle plan would not have been approved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The addition of the magic scroll made the war more intense, and the sky also emitted colorful brilliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, flames flew all over the sky, for a while, hailstones fell from the sky, and for a while, a meteorite popped out...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by magic blows, there were countless orc masters who took the lead and rushed to the front line of the battle. The defenders are dazed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar battles are constantly being staged throughout the northern land. More than ten strategic locations in the Alpha Kingdom were raided almost at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to organize resistance is considered a good performance. More defenders who are in a hurry to fight, do not know what happened, and the enemy is killed in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of military officers sent out a letter for help in a state of confusion. Everyone only knew that they were attacked by the enemy, and the rest were completely blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James, who was sitting on the front line, lost sleep. Although he didn't know what happened, he always felt that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Immediately send Griffin Dragoons to patrol the defense lines everywhere, order the officers on the front line to strengthen their vigilance, and strictly guard against the enemy's sneak attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find any changes in the enemy, report to me immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After adding an order, he felt a little relieved. It was the first time he commanded so many troops alone, and he was also very disturbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, as the defensive side, the mobilization of troops is relatively small. Although there have been many disturbances, they are generally controllable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just that with the early collapse of the first line of defense, his confidence gradually became insufficient again. At one time, he wanted to apply to the king for a substitution, but he couldn't help himself in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that sooner or later the war in northern Xinjiang will be commanded by Hudson, but sooner or later, the meaning it represents is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king needs him to persevere for a while, and all the great nobles in the kingdom also need him to persevere first, even if he needs to pay a certain price, everyone agrees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, Hudson is not only outstanding in military exploits, but also too young to find even political stains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone works hard, and checks and balances can still be carried out. If we continue to let it go, what will the next generation do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the people in charge of each family will be Hudson's old department, and they will be short by nature. Even if it is a king, he will have no confidence when he encounters such a powerful minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless everyone can guarantee that they can live longer than Hudson, he will not be allowed to become the elder of the kingdom, and the balance of power will be maintained by everyone's seniority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, a middle-aged officer broke into the headquarters and reported to James: \"Marquis, just now the defenders of Fort Bogus received news that the enemy cavalry crossed their line of defense this afternoon and have not returned yet. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc cavalry crossing the border is nothing new. This kind of thing has not stopped since the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these cavalry usually return to their station immediately after going deep into dozens of miles and doing some damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time that something that is gone forever like now has happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why didn't you report this kind of thing in advance?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, you guys go down first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking one's anger out on others is not what a good commander should do. Reason told him that he must control his emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is an uncontrollable event that the enemy will never return, and no one knows in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just cavalry crossing the border to cause damage, and that's all handled by the people below. If such trivial matters were reported to his coach, he would have been exhausted long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cavalry crossing the border is also taking risks. If they are accidentally bitten by the army of the kingdom, they may be wiped out at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, the orc soldiers who went deep into the rear were defeated by the kingdom's army not once or twice, and they were even wiped out once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No good news has been received so far, which means that the enemy cavalry who went deep into the rear have not been annihilated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, James' complexion changed drastically, his eyes fixed on the map, and he blurted out: \"Not good!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 449": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 449: land bond\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    It was dawn, and Beitlun Port was also turned into a sea of ​​flames. Except for sporadic resistance forces in the city, the rest of the city lay down permanently in the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The bait we set up will not confuse the enemy for long, and they will soon discover our true purpose. Send the order to let the people below destroy the port quickly, and then retreat immediately!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from personally leading the command that the real target of this surprise attack is Beitlun Port. At the same time, sneak attacks were launched in multiple places, mainly to distract the enemy's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, he must not only consider the completion of the strategic raid, but also consider the withdrawal of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running deep behind enemy lines is inherently dangerous. Once the enemy army discovers their destination, even if they can complete the sneak attack, they will never want to retreat unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is inherently anti-human behavior. The more impossible things are thought to happen, the easier it is to become the key point of victory or defeat on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simultaneously attacking more than ten fortresses is almost impossible militarily. Any mistake in any link may cause heavy losses to the army, but Duke Daniel still did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides the inevitable victory of Beit Ferry Port, the rest is to beat the rabbits. It's best to be able to conquer it, and it doesn't matter if you can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from the formulation of the plan, the characterization of the armies from all walks of life is-feint attack. With the help of the siege of the army as a cover, a small number of masters were sent to sneak into the city and burn the enemy's food and grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no mandatory mission goal, every warehouse of strategic materials burned is profitable, and the main focus is to destroy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is a feint attack, the corresponding troops will naturally not be too many. Except for the 10,000 troops led by Daniel himself, there were two or three thousand cavalry on the other battlefields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the cover of night, it is not difficult to create the momentum of thousands of troops. The enemy can't figure out the situation, so they can only close their doors and defend themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is discovered that the neighborhood has been attacked by an enemy, the nearby troops dare not move out easily when everything is uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People tend to be pros and cons. If you don't receive the military order from above, you have no responsibility for standing still. If you attack without authorization and lose the battle, you will be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the sky brightened, the orc cavalry who failed to attack the city began to evacuate one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This place is the territory of the Alpha Kingdom after all. If it takes a long time, once the nearby troops gather, it will be their turn to be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only an accident that the Bauhinia Pass was conquered, and more troops just completed the feint mission. However, they caught the defenders by surprise and took the opportunity to burn a lot of strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything went according to Duke Daniel's plan, the only difference was that they did not encounter any pursuers from the Alpha Kingdom when they evacuated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, looking at the battle report in his hand, Caesar IV called it impossible. There was no problem on the front line, but the rear first became chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If wars are fought like this, then why do we need the defenders on the front line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the enemy cannot be stopped, at least the news of the entry of the enemy should be sent back in advance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is James doing? Why did he let so many enemies go deep into the rear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, besides regret, he still regrets. It was only less than a month after staying with James, and he made such a big mess, and the king couldn't help it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had known that this kind of thing would happen, he should have replaced him earlier. The warning documents from the front line arrived later than the appeal letters from all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the officers on the front line were inefficient and dereliction of duty, or whether they were themselves incompetent and unaware of the enemy's sinister intentions in advance, is not at all important now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have already happened. Beitlun Port was destroyed, and the kingdom's material delivery capacity to the northern border has dropped by at least 50%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there are many material hoarding places including Zijingguan, which suffered heavy losses from enemy sneak attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the data gathered from the front line, the sneak attack launched by the enemy last night caused nearly 30,000 casualties to the Kingdom's army, and tens of thousands of tons of strategic materials were wiped out in the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV was furious, and the faces of the officials were not much better. The Kingdom lost 70% of the strategic materials hoarded on the front line overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct consequence is: the army on the front line is in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large amount of strategic material loss, there is no way to fill the gap in a short time. It's not that the kingdom doesn't have supplies, but that the frontlines don't have supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the transportation capacity is declining, the logistics transportation speed cannot keep up with the consumption. Only the material inventory on the front line will not last long at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, things have already happened, let's find a way to deal with the aftermath first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's sneak attack came very suddenly, and the defenders were completely unprepared. It is not surprising to have such a record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the enemy commander is not easy. Throughout history, it is the first time that cavalry has been used in this way. It is understandable that Marquis James did not find out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority, we still need to stabilize our position first, restore Beit Ferry Port as soon as possible, and ensure the smooth flow of sea transportation lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing can be done, we will abandon some areas, shrink the strategic defense line, and shorten our transportation lines to ensure the supply of logistics materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce unnecessary losses, let the people in several provinces of northern Xinjiang evacuate first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After covering the evacuation of the people, the noble private army in the border area does not need to stick to the castle, and directly acts with the army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested objectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief, Marquis James, must be to blame for the war's situation, but it is more due to the overall lack of quality of the Kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, there have been only a handful of cases of cavalry attacking cities. Not to mention rushing to the enemy's rear and launching a sneak attack to seize the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the final result, you can tell that if the defenders are vigilant enough, the enemy troops are blocked outside the city gate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who is successfully attacked by the enemy is a serious problem in the defenders themselves, and the defenders of the city are absolutely dereliction of duty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys deserve what they deserve, and there is nothing to regret. It is the best choice to die on the battlefield. It is not good for everyone to be held accountable when they come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the noble lords of northern Xinjiang, Hudson still has to reach out. As the leader of the emerging big aristocrats, even if it is only the boss in name, he must make a contribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if Hudson doesn't mention it, there will be others who will jump out to be \"good guys\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, they are emerging nobles, but in essence they are still branches of various families. The so-called \"emerging\" is actually just a political need to set an example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader of Hudson is nameless. The biggest reason is that most of the emerging aristocrats come from established aristocrats. The conflicts between the two sides do exist, but they are not as sharp as they appear to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really think that the rising nobles and the established nobles will never die, then wait to be cheated to death!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who really have more conflicts with the established nobles are rising stars like the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal is right. The most important thing now is to stabilize the situation. However, it is not enough to shrink the front line and restore logistics and transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle on the front line is like this, and Marquis James must be responsible for it. I propose to remove him from the post of commander, detain him and return him to the capital for accountability, and replace him with Marshal Hudson to take over the post of commander. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the ferocious expression, it seemed as if he wished to tear Marquis James into pieces. However, the expressions of politicians are often full of deception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles want face, especially high-level commanders like this. Even if you want to kill someone, you will be given a decent way to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the former five great dukes of the Northland were all self-sufficient, rather than executed after being pushed out to a public trial and convicted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That still involves the Human Race Alliance. If a high-ranking nobleman is executed in the kingdom, their death will be more decent, usually in battle or accidental death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want the life of Marquis James, there is no need to detain him at all, but just let Hudson take over as commander in chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, it only needs to be dealt with coldly. For the glory of the nobles, Marquis James will find a chance to die on the battlefield and retain his last dignity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to reach out at this time, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland can't help himself. He is not only the prime minister of the kingdom, but also a member of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Marquis of James is a general of the royal family. If he is to be dealt with seriously, then the following generals who are close to the royal family can hardly be blamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influence of the royal family in the military has only recovered in the past two years. If it is cleaned out now, it will be difficult to recover in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Factional struggles are everywhere, and the opportunity to weaken the royal family has come to the door, and the great nobles of the kingdom will not be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is processed, the situation is still good. The great nobles are basically not in the capital, and the power of the royal family dominates the court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, everyone turned their attention to Hudson. Whether it is to severely punish Marquis James, or to let him go, it is inseparable from the commander-in-chief Hudson's nod.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a big taboo for military strategists to change generals just before the battle. Besides, there are still affairs of the expeditionary army to deal with, so I can't leave for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Marquis James stabilize the situation first, and gradually shrink the front line according to the actual situation on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will take them to the front line after the expeditionary corps takes a short rest and replenishes their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, taking advantage of this opportunity, I will train the new recruits gathered from all over the place. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be embarrassed and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a mess, just throw it to him. Every time I go to war, I will turn the tide, that is too bullying. If he didn't say anything, I really thought he had lost his temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the enemy has moved, it is absolutely impossible to only have these actions. Regarding the situation on the front line, Hudson has very limited knowledge. Who knows how many pitfalls there will be in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in a hurry to take over, then take the blame for Marquis James. The friendship between the two has not yet reached this level, so there is no need to rush to get close.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the situation has deteriorated, and no matter how bad it is, it won't go bad. It is no longer what it used to be. Even if the orcs were given a chance, they would not be able to swallow the frontline army in one go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV was about to speak, but finally closed his mouth helplessly. As soon as the Western Front War ended, the Ministry of Military Affairs proposed a change of commander. For political needs, he proposed and decided to stay as Marquis James.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that this happened, the unknown label was directly slapped on his forehead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coupled with the inherent character design of \"not understanding military affairs\", Caesar IV himself has a lot of troubles, let alone reaching out to pull Marquis James.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the strategic contraction is being carried out. Although it is voluntarily giving up the territory, it is still \"lost the city and the land\" in the eyes of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who loves his feathers, is unwilling to take the blame, and as a king, he can't force others. Otherwise, if something goes wrong later, the responsibility will fall on him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking for help, the officials turned to the officials, but unfortunately, everyone is a smart person who knows what to blame and what not to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in military affairs, if you don't understand, it's best not to compare blindly, otherwise the consequences will be very serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the marshal is right. The loss of strategic materials is too heavy. In the future, it is best for the kingdom to choose a defensive position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we want to counterattack, we must wait for us to raise enough strategic materials. Otherwise, even if the orc army is defeated, the kingdom will not be able to expand its results. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Efiero said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line suffered a defeat, but the main force of the kingdom's army was not damaged, mainly due to the shortage of strategic supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make bricks without straw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the gap in supplies is not resolved, it will be the same whoever commanded the army in the past. That being the case, why offend people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson gave the royal family face and did not demand severe punishment of Marquis James. As for the crime of \"losing the city and losing the land\", it should have been carried by him, the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these problems, how to give an explanation to the domestic nobles in the future is what the Ministry of Military Affairs needs to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, Marquis Delgado's face turned dark. To make up for the shortage of strategic materials, it cannot be solved with a few words, and the Ministry of Finance has to pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly there is such a big hole, what to use to fill it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, too many supplies have been lost this time. In a short period of time, it may be difficult to make up for the shortfall only by raising money from within the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best option is to speed up self-raised materials while purchasing strategic materials from overseas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the kingdom is already heavily in debt, and the debt owed by the Ministry of Finance to the lords of various places has reached an extremely terrifying figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Finance directly came up to cry for poverty, which made everyone even more depressed. Everyone knows that the kingdom is short of money, but there is no way, the war will consume it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Raising” is easy to say, but the question is where to raise money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to increase taxes, and the lives of nobles and lords everywhere are also difficult now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, there have been events in some areas where small nobles went bankrupt and big nobles paid taxes on their behalf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The help is not for nothing. I owe such a big favor, and I will not be able to rely on the big nobles in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present has a bit of integrity, and they can't do things that shake the foundation of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the kingdom's financial difficulties are a fact. For the present plan, I am afraid that the only way to solve the urgent need is to issue bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Kingdom has already owed a large amount of debts, and simply issuing bonds may not be bought by everyone. Even if it can be sold, the high capital interest will overwhelm the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be best to be able to add a layer of security to the bond. I propose to use the land on the orc prairie as a guarantee to issue land bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    1 mu of land is equivalent to 1 gold coin, and you can directly gamble on it. As long as the kingdom wins the war, everyone can hold bonds for land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance confidence, Your Majesty is requested to set an example and assure the outside world that land bonds will be dealt with first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, the nobles were rewarded, and the fiefs of the small nobles were given priority, followed by the middle nobles, and then the big nobles and the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the harvested land is not enough, then we people will not be divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the kingdom is defeated, then these land bonds will be voided directly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such rebellious remarks are simply a provocation to the aristocratic system. The royal family and the great nobles have always taken the lead. How can there be any reason for the people below to divide first?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you can get a fief with a little money, this is simply an insult to the nobles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    us…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Minister of Internal Affairs finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"If you have a better way, then even if I didn't say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't think of a way, then please keep your mouth shut. What is needed now is to solve the problem, not to discuss the pros and cons of the solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether it will impact the aristocratic system, I think this kind of worry is unnecessary. The matter of buying and selling fiefdoms is not without precedent on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One gold coin per mu of land, the price is indeed very cheap. But the land is on the prairie, without any strength, can it be developed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have to pay taxes when you take the land. If you are unable to develop it, it is not wealth, but a burden. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suggestion has reached this point, if you still can't react, everyone will be in the officialdom for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that anyone can buy land bonds, but those who have the money to buy them and have the strength to develop them are the great nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meat is still in the pot after all, the difference is only that those who share the biggest cake will pay to support this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After figuring this out, everyone's anger was almost vented at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous orc invasions reached the later stage, and the finances were on the verge of collapse. Vested interest groups would inevitably want to cut their flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land bond proposed by Hudson now is nothing more than letting everyone pay in another way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order of loot distribution is placed last, and it seems that the group of great nobles paid a heavy price. But the right to distribute is in the hands of everyone, so how big can the loss be?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making such a gesture to the outside world can also boost the morale of the army and calm down the inner grievances of the small and medium-sized nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitated for a while, seeing that no one objected, Caesar IV said slowly: \"Since everyone does not object, let's try issuing a batch of land bonds first!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Especially when facing orcs, unity is usually +120.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present has dual identities, they are both the managers of the kingdom and the shareholders of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a leader, he must take the lead in buying at this time. If the upper level has no confidence in winning the war, the lower levels will have even less confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As the marshal of the kingdom, I also proposed this plan, so I will lead everyone by subscribing for six million acres of land bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the 2.3 million kingdom bonds held in the hands, as well as some debts owed by the government, were all converted into land bonds to reduce the financial pressure on the kingdom and save our finance minister from complaining about high interest rates. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes time to lose money, you can't be petty. Just back from the front, everybody knows he's rich, Lord Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, selling medicines made a lot of money in the past. The nobles of the kingdom are not rich, and they also have the credit of Hastelloy Pharmaceuticals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows the specific profit of selling medicine, but everyone can make a preliminary judgment from the war wealth generated by the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people below have all made a fortune, and it is even more impossible for them to be poor as a coach. Cash + all kinds of physical objects, discounted to three to four million gold coins must be indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the profiteering properties of magic potions, no one would believe him if he said that he hadn't earned millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than being missed by others, it is better to take it out. Anyway, the kingdom is really out of money now, and if the kingdom doesn't want to go bankrupt at this time, major shareholders must inject capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson had no choice but to throw out all the high-yield bonds in his hand. Since the outbreak of the Continental War, the Ministry of Finance has announced that the payment of bond interest will be postponed until after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To pay after the war, the kingdom's finances must be able to last until after the war. No matter how high the interest income is, it cannot withstand financial bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of waiting for the kingdom's finances to go bankrupt, it is better to take the initiative to exchange for land bonds, and by the way gain a good reputation for taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the slightly higher land price, that is completely a false proposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land bonds held by the great nobles will only be cashed out in the future. Only the area of ​​arable land will be calculated, and other messy land will most likely become gifts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the bond is in the hands of small and medium-sized nobles, there will not be so many gifts, but when calculating the area badly, there will probably be a discount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the bond falls into the hands of the merchant, then there is nothing to say, no matter whether it is a good land or a bad land, it will be honored truthfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossing classes also requires paying a price. How can it be possible to obtain a fiefdom without paying a premium?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to speak out about the unspoken rules in advance. Those who understand understand it, and those who don't don't need to understand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Marshal Hudson has set an example, we cannot fall behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal family subscribed for 7 million gold coins of land bonds, and the more than 8 million debts owed by the Ministry of Finance to the royal family were all converted into land bonds. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV pretended to be happy and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, his heart was bleeding when making this decision. But there is no way, the marshal Hudson has paid so much, how can he be stingy as a king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buying land bonds does not seem to be a loss, but the problem is that the current royal family does not lack land! There are three provinces in the north that have not been developed, so there is no need to rush to the prairie to grab a map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Land is an asset only if it is developed, and land that cannot be developed is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance owes a huge amount of debt to the royal family. He can take these debts that are likely to be unfinished and exchange them for land bonds, making the numbers look even more dazzling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pain is the pain, but it doesn't mean to blame Hudson. The issuance of land bonds is undoubtedly the best weapon for the kingdom to get rid of the debt crisis in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both the king and the marshal took the lead in exchanging debts for land bonds. Are the nobles still ashamed to pursue debts from the Ministry of Finance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simple exchange, the creditor's rights relationship has changed. Most of the huge debts placed on the Ministry of Finance were directly wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The financial pressure has been greatly reduced in a short period of time, and Marquis Delgado can also take a breather. Otherwise, the chancellor of the exchequer will be put down, and no suitable replacement will be found in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it is not necessary to pay directly for the subscription of land bonds. Equivalent strategic materials can also be discounted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During financial difficulties, the kingdom purchases supplies from the royal family and great nobles, which was originally an IOU.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the debt increased to a certain level, exceeding the financial repayment limit, and the creditors took the initiative to reduce the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually the Terran Alliance issues a call, and international creditors announce partial debt relief, domestic creditors will naturally respond to the call.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that is on the premise that the alien race is strong and all parties need the Alpha Kingdom to block the Orc Empire. Now that the advantages of the human race are becoming more and more obvious, it is useless to expect such a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the last orc invasion, it is now more difficult for the Kingdom government to borrow money from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only has the loan changed from an interest-free loan to an interest-bearing loan, but also added a bunch of additional conditions, many of which exceeded the bottom line acceptable to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the outside world can't count on it, then it can only tap the internal potential. To put it simply, those who have money will pay, and those who have no money will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two big bosses took the lead, and the officials responded one after another, but the subscription amount was much smaller, and the sum of all of them could not keep up with the amount of the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't panic about this at all. The richest people in the Alpha Kingdom were the great nobles from all over the place. Except for a few emerging big aristocrats who are not rich, the rest are extremely rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those ancient big families, the wealth accumulated over thousands of years is an astonishing figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just look at the prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the premise that there is no major change in productivity, the currency circulation is increasing every year, and prices on the mainland have been stable for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that these additional currencies eventually flowed into the cellars of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the nobles in the southern continent, the wealth accumulation of the noble group of the Alpha Kingdom is not that rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of frequent wars, most of the kingdom's wealth has flowed out. After the war is over, there will even be economic deflation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, under the self-sufficient system of the feudal monarch, deflation did not have much impact on the economy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a money panic, and the big deal is to barter directly. There weren't many commodity transactions in the first place, so Ren Ren passed away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no matter how bad the economic environment is, the nobles will not let the serfs lose their jobs. If the grain cannot be sold, more warehouses are built to pile it up. The next time a war breaks out, the storage can consume the excess food production capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the land bonds were sold, Hudson felt at ease. The higher the cost of input and payment, the more people will be tied to the chariot to death, and the less worried they will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After    and other great nobles from all over the country donated their money generously, all interest groups in the kingdom are locked in this war, and internal conflicts will be suppressed to the maximum extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern border, orc army camp. The five emperors came to the front line to celebrate this hard-won victory together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few years, the Orc Empire has had a bad time. They painstakingly prepared to launch a war, but the allies did not follow up in time, and they were severely beaten by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying a terrible price, they were about to recuperate when the Continental War suddenly broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being involved in the war again, everyone actually has no bottom in their hearts. Due to the situation, I can only bite the bullet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie are easy to bully, and they took care of them without wasting much effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference between a small country and a big country is still very obvious. Being able to easily clean up the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland does not mean that they can also easily defeat the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old enemy who has been fighting for hundreds of years, everyone is well aware of the difficulty of the Alpha Kingdom. No one imagines that this enemy can be destroyed. Our goal is to regain the lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that after a surprise attack by Duke Daniel, the enemy would take the initiative to carry out a strategic contraction and return a large area of ​​land to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lords, now is not the time to be happy. If the enemy stays and fights to the death with us, there is still a chance to annihilate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But they suddenly carried out a strategic contraction, and all the combat plans they had deployed were now useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, the enemy will change coaches soon. We want to destroy the Alpha Kingdom in a short time, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Duke Daniel finished speaking, the Lion King interrupted: \"Marshal Daniel, the current situation is very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If five years ago, we would have supported you in destroying the Alpha Kingdom without hesitation, but not now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current strength of the empire, even if it can destroy the Alpha Kingdom, it cannot stop the human counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The international situation has deteriorated too fast, the half-orc kingdom has fallen, and only sporadic armed forces are left to resist; the ancient survivors who can help us have been defeated by the Alphas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other races in the alliance are also having a hard time. They are all waiting for the reinforcements of the elves, but those pedantic elves are pitifully inefficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, it is a great victory to ensure that the races in the alliance will no longer be destroyed by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One wrong step, one wrong step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All ethnic groups looked forward and backward, did not start with us a few years ago, missed the best time to make a move, and were doomed to the current tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The empire is powerless to reverse the general trend. What we have to do is to keep our current interests and prevent the race from growing bigger! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of \"counseling\" make it hard to believe that it came from the mouth of the Lion King. You must know that a few years ago, he was still the most staunch main fighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this is the power of the mainland overlord Iron Fist. Only after being beaten once in person can he know the weight of the overlord of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before survival, hatred is secondary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ambition needs the support of strength after all. The last war extinguished the ambition of the five emperors to compete for the hegemony of the mainland. Now they just want to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the emperors, Daniel secretly sighed. If he had been in charge of the last battle, even if he couldn't win against the human race, he definitely wouldn't have lost so badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty the Lion King, the situation on the mainland is indeed not good for us, but it is not much better for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the pressure of the alliance, it would be difficult for the human race to unite. In the follow-up battle, even if they can get some support, the strength will not be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Alpha Kingdom is severely damaged, we will be able to win thirty years of recuperation time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the stability of the empire in the next 30 years, we must continue to maintain the offensive in the next battle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the ambitions of the few emperors are gone, the cake must be smaller, so that they feel that they can achieve it with just a little effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there are too many races in the Orc Empire, even as the head coach, they are restrained by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They say they want to be united, but the five royal families have been fighting for so many years, how can one sentence be able to eliminate the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dares to give up easily the military power that involves the survival of the race. Daniel is the commander-in-chief of the army, but he must be responsible to the five emperors at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous self-assertion caused a lot of slander. For the sake of victory on the battlefield, no one raised this question, but the seeds of doubt were still planted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reconciling internal disputes is also one of the responsibilities of the coach. Doing this is often more difficult than winning battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back to the Mountain Territory, and had a good night's sleep. Hudson, who had just relaxed, was attracted by the data in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The North Continent is in constant war. It stands to reason that the number of refugees should continue to increase. However, the number of immigrants introduced these days has not increased but decreased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do the officials of the Immigration Agency do for food? Why did the number of immigrants suddenly drop?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he is in a high position, he has long been used to showing his emotions and anger. The last time I lost my temper like this was two years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the matter this time is too big, no matter how well-mannered it is, it can't cover up the anger in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of refugees accepted will be directly related to the future development of the mountain territory. Wouldn't it be embarrassing if there was no one who tried his best to expand the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to increase the population on a large scale is rare in decades. If this opportunity is missed, the natural growth of the population will follow, and no matter how much you encourage births, you will not be able to keep up with the demand!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, we have introduced a large number of immigrants, which has aroused widespread attention from the outside world. Although no one has stumbled, there are still many nobles who follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only a secondary reason for the decline in immigration. With the cooperation of the Principality of Moxi, we have an absolute advantage in introducing immigrants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's just the case, changed late last month. The slowdown in the number of refugees in the Principality of Mosi, coupled with the recovery of the Warhammer Great Plains, has attracted a large number of Warhammers to return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by these adverse factors, our plan to introduce refugees has also suffered setbacks. The Immigration Agency has already communicated with the Principality of Moxi, and I believe it will be soon...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of the last, Jacob suddenly lacked confidence. The number of refugees is not as large as expected, and the plan to introduce refugees will inevitably be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the government of the Principality of Moxi is willing to cooperate, but now that the war is over, a large amount of abandoned land in their country still needs labor to reclaim it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the number of refugees is still insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get to the bottom of it, either the refugees are unwilling to stay in the Northern Continent, or the elf army is advancing too fast, and everyone has no chance to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think it's the latter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alien Alliance is still waiting for the elf army to support them. The elves are in a hurry, so they have no time to pay attention to the fleeing refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one deliberately hinders, and the influx of refugees into neighboring countries is inevitable. Either go all the way south and enter the central continent, or flee to the relatively stable Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ask them to send over the latest information on the war situation in the Northern Continent, and attach some important international events worthy of attention.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the marshal of the kingdom, the biggest advantage is that you can use the kingdom's intelligence network. As long as they are interested, they can ask them to check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the kingdom's intelligence network is very simple, and it is all collected by foreign agencies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It can only receive some ordinary intelligence, and its penetration into the governments of various countries is not deep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Tom turned around and went out to implement, leaving Jacob standing there awkwardly, not knowing what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's leave it at that for the issue of the reduction of immigrants! The focus of the work of the Ministry of Government Affairs is still to resettle immigrants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past six months, the territory has received a large number of immigrants, which is also a great challenge to the government system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, get them settled first, and let everyone have a job. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just half a year, the population of the territory doubled directly. There are still a large number of refugees pouring in on the road, which is also a test for local governance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson can't ask for much. As long as the people are settled down and there is no trouble, the remaining problems can be solved slowly later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no jobs, they go to open up wasteland, build roads, and repair water conservancy projects. Most of the swamp has been developed, but the remaining area is enough for everyone to be busy for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing the work, adjust the industrial structure. It is estimated that before that day, the mainland war will end first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win the war, there will naturally be new territories for everyone to develop. If unfortunately lost, a large number of casualties will also free up living space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the external expansion of victory, defeat is the peak period of internal mergers. A large number of unlucky nobles have become extinct, and it is another feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it is to supplement the loss, eating from the outside is the same as eating from the inside. The only difference lies in the large mergers, and there is no room for relaxation of internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decline of a country often begins with the intensification of internal conflicts. The harder you squeeze the inside, the faster it will collapse.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
