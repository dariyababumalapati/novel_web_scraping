In the capital of the kingdom, there was also a Marshal's residence in Hudson.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Although it may not come once every few years, the appearance is still there.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In this regard, the Mossi people have done a great job, which also proves from the side that the Mossi government still has a lot of money.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In comparison, the Alpha Kingdom government was much stingier. In order to save money, they had to pay for the maintenance of the official residence themselves.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Fortunately, the kingdom's top leaders do not live on salaries, otherwise the little money the government gives out would not even be enough to cover the daily maintenance costs of the mansions.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Of course, this does not mean that the salaries of officials in the Alpha Kingdom are low, nor that the government is corrupt and incompetent; it is just that the kingdom's finances are scarce after the war, and it is temporarily unable to pay salaries and cannot afford the maintenance costs of official residences.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Low-level bureaucrats had to support their families, and no one dared to touch their salaries, so they could only owe them to higher-ups. A number of high-ranking officials in the kingdom, including King Caesar IV, were creditors of the Ministry of Finance.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This debt became a habit, and Hudson had never received a full salary from the time he became the Royal Marshal until now, except during wartime.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Under normal circumstances, the royal government needs to pay Hudson 30,000 gold coins every year, including annual salary + various subsidies + residence maintenance costs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The reality is that Hudson can only receive 300 gold coins from the royal government every year, and the actual issuance ratio is exactly 1%, which makes him not know how to complain.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There is no doubt that this is a standard number that has been accurately calculated by the Ministry of Finance.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     This amount is just enough to cover the cost of supporting a bureaucrat's family and maintaining a decent life for the lower-class nobles. As long as no major changes occur, under normal circumstances, there will be a surplus of 180 gold coins every year.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Officials whose annual income was above this figure had their salaries withheld by the royal government for various reasons, while those whose income was below this figure were paid in full.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Including the king's annuity, only this much can be received each year, and the remaining hundreds of thousands are debts.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     It's an old tradition.

Given the level of attention the Alpha Kingdom has received, if the government has a huge amount of funds of unknown origin, all parties can turn the continent upside down to investigate.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Just after returning from the auction, Hudson found that all the people who came from the kingdom to attend the auction were blocking his door. He was completely confused.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     \"Marshal, I'm afraid the Principality of Moshi is being targeted.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The sudden appearance of the evil god's followers may not be accidental. The fox girl turned into an elf, and the traces of the big forces manipulating behind the scenes became more obvious.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     With this incident, I guess the Moshi government no longer has the heart to continue holding the auction.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     We would like to ask you to help us make some connections and trade some potions and alchemical items with the Moshi people privately.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If possible, please help smooth things over so that we can visit Master Kemboyin's laboratory.\"\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Hudson was shocked after hearing the first half of Robert's analysis.

It involves Master Kemboyin.

Hudson has the value to be won over by all parties, and no matter how distant the relationship is, it can become a bond among them.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Even if there is no relationship, one can create one.
