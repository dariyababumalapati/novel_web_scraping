After roughly waking up the unconscious old Yingman, he made an introduction on his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at a group of trembling shrimpmen, the old man Yingren was speechless for a moment. He has completely despaired of Maxim's original \"matchmaking method\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed helping to promote the relationship, but the result is somewhat contrary. It is not the good-neighborliness and friendship that you want, but looking for excitement through enmity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the bully was only a low-level shrimp tribe. If he ran into the powerful sea tribe, Maxim could run away, and the old man Yingren could only feed the fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Lord Maxim, let me do the rest of the negotiations!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elder Yingman said tremblingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was really afraid of the red dragon in front of him, lest Maxim would continue to toss and make him become a wanted criminal of the Sea Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are not many warriors who dare to slay dragons, but there are countless ones who dare to slay eagles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even as an envoy of the orc empire, in this vast sea, there is no card.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You negotiate slowly, Benlong's task has been completed. In the future, you can also find me to cooperate with similar businesses!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Maxime shook his dragon's tail, left the old eagle man directly, and flew into the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I lost face. Having made such a big oolong, Maxim was too embarrassed to stay where he was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a pain for the old man Yingman. Fortunately, he reacted quickly enough, otherwise he fell directly into the sea water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Yingren family soars between heaven and earth, but does not include crossing the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the saying goes: an eagle who falls into the water is not as good as a chicken!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the red dragon leave, the shrimp man on the opposite side gradually regained his courage and glared at the old man Ying man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't know what the old man Eagle said to Maxim just now, just because he was brought by that nasty red dragon was enough to make the group of shrimps hate him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, the old Yingman regained his previous momentum, and cast animal language magic to the group of shrimp people in front of him, saying:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I am an envoy of the Orc Empire, invited by Dragon King Maxim, and I came here specially to visit your king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humble shrimpman, tell me, which race is the ruler of this sea area? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical eagle fighting dragon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Maxim's appearance, it is easy to pretend to be the Dragon King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't understand the relationship between the two, the shrimp who had just mustered up the courage to ask the teacher, lost his temper in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the bottom race among the Sea Clan, the most important thing to survive is to judge the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being bullied by a dragon is not something to be ashamed of. Just being taken aback and not entering the dragon's belly, they were considered lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, this sea area is the territory of the Murloc Kingdom. From here, after flying a thousand miles to the east, you will be able to find the Murloc King's Court.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shrimp people headed by hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Survival experience told them that it is best to keep the things of the big shots out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, Human Race Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the joint proposal of the frontline generals came, the venue became noisy again. Using mercenaries to fight wars is the norm in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for many small and medium-sized countries with few wars, maintaining a large standing army for a long time is too costly. It is far less cost-effective to temporarily recruit mercenaries than during wartime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, mercenaries are not fools. They also help people fight wars. On different battlefields, the prices charged are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous war against the orcs, mercenary regiments were rarely seen. It wasn't that the three northern countries were reluctant to spend money, but that they couldn't hire people at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who came out to be mercenaries were only seeking money, not killing their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no hopeful war in sight, everyone will automatically retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation has changed, the balance of war has been tilted, and the Terran coalition has an obvious advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against the wind will always be the favorite of mercenaries. As long as the price is in place, there is no need to worry about no one participating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the conditions for recruiting mercenaries are met, and now the only problem is money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is hopeless, the messy debts are added together, even if the total amount does not exceed 100 million, it is estimated that it will not be much worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them pay again, that is the rhythm of going bankrupt every minute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, the debt borrowed earlier will really become a dead debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats, they are all a family, so they have to show some face. After all, it is the money owed for the dominance of the human race. You can't use force to collect it, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have to pay out of your own pocket, everyone will always think twice before acting. On the issue of the amount of funds, all parties have launched a heated discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a few million to hundreds of millions, there are representative proposals. The more power that has no money in their pockets, the bigger the number they put forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the three unlucky **** in the north, who are heavily indebted, proposed by the lion that the Human Race Alliance will contribute 300 million gold coins, which has the momentum to smash the orcs to death with gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal clans of orcs, men, women, old and young together, now have just over 10 million. There are twenty gold coins per capita, which is enough to drive all the participants crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If so much money is really spent, reinforcements may not be needed, and the coalition forces on the front line alone will be able to completely wipe out the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, this kind of heroic prodigal behavior was collectively rejected by all parties who needed to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A bargaining quarrel was constantly staged in the meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    300 million gold coins, 280 million gold coins, 250 million gold coins...105 million gold coins, 100 million gold coins, 98 million gold coins...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three poor ghosts in the north who can't afford the money are responsible for presenting the figures, and all parties are responsible for bargaining. The chaos of the scene is comparable to that of the vegetable market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The later the stage, the closer the expectations of all parties are, and the more sensitive the disputed figures are. The specific number of declines is getting lower and lower, and no one can say when an agreement will be reached.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Union Council has been unable to make a decision for a long time, but Hudson on the front line can't wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, it will continue to drag on. Don't say that the war will not end within this year, and it might not end until next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You cannot spend your precious youth on the battlefield all the time. After nearly 20 months of continuous combat, even Hudson couldn't stand the tense nerves, let alone the officers and soldiers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Iribian army camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Marquis, the Earl of Hudson is visiting!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Marquis Olafur frowned slightly. Experience had taught him that Hudson's visit could never be a good one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time of war, and no nobleman would be foolish to stop by at this time. If you are unlucky and encounter an orc on the way, it will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since entering the mountains, the death rate of the noble officers and soldiers of the coalition forces has skyrocketed. Even if there are orc cannon fodder to open the way, there will still be fish that slip through the net and sneak in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is very thieves, and deliberately chose the battlefield on the remaining veins of the Ula Mountains. Not just one hilltop, but one hilltop after another, from time to time there will be monsters rushing out to attack the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The visitor is the guest. As a partner on the battlefield, there is no conflict of core interests. We don't say how deep the friendship is, but the relationship between them is still passable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the murderous Velociraptor Legion from a distance, Hudson felt a burst of envy. Despite the small number of these extraordinary units, their combat effectiveness is very powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the Knights of the Kingdom, it is not enough to meet these extraordinary troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is used well, the effect it can exert on the battlefield is even better than thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson calculated that if the Koslow family invested at all costs after the war, they could barely make up a full-fledged knight order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if you want to create an extraordinary unit, then don't think about it. Not all monsters are suitable for group combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, most of the mainstream extraordinary units on the mainland are sub-dragon beasts. The core factor is that these races have inherited the characteristics of the Dragon Race—prostitution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Create beasts when there is nothing to do, so that these Yalong beast races have always maintained a high fertility rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the pregnancy time is a little longer and the growth cycle is a little longer, but for the big forces that inherit the ancients, they can still afford to wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, after countless years of research, the human race has also mastered the method of ripening Warcraft. Although a certain price needs to be paid, compared with the powerful strength brought by extraordinary arms, everything is worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the hands of Hudson alone, he has mastered two methods that can speed up the growth of Warcraft. What is the specific effect? ​​I haven't had time to try it yet, but it is theoretically established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unified standard in this regard, and all major forces have their own research results. There are also various methods and specific effects to ripen monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the large-scale ripening is currently mainly aimed at low-level monsters. The wisdom of these monsters is relatively low, so it is better to fool around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you do this to high-level monsters, people will be able to find out the side effects immediately, and they may be able to turn their faces on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, this way please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was Hudson's envious eyes, which made him very face-saving. Marquis Olafur was very enthusiastic, and directly took Hudson to visit the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more he saw, the more shocked Hudson became. Originally thought that as long as the Alpha Kingdom regained its strength, it would be able to catch up with these top powers by virtue of a sound mobilization mechanism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turns out that he still thinks too much. The ranking of the recognized powers on the mainland is still very scientifically based.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the mobilization ability of the Kingdom of Iribia is not as good as that of the Kingdom of Alpha, but it can't hold back the strength of others!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the saying goes, one force will drop ten meetings. In the face of absolute strength, it is simply not possible to reverse the mobilization ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that the coalition forces have slaughtered all sides on the front line, and the main force of the orcs has not seen a decisive battle. It's not that the orc royal family was cowardly, it's simply that the coalition forces are too strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around, there was no ordinary person in the camp. Even the weakest soldier has practiced Dou Qi for several years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to train so many practitioners and soldiers is naturally because these countries are in a relatively peaceful environment and have sufficient financial resources to invest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not as tragic as the Alpha Kingdoms, where every generation gets ravaged by orcs. As soon as the war ended, the debts began to be paid. After the debts were cleared, it would not be long before the army of orcs came to kill them again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Marquis Olafur, the overall quality of your country's army really opened my eyes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to flatter, he is also a person with status and has his own pride. But a few words of flattery are fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow the study. To build a similar army, Hudson does not have the capital yet, but it is still feasible to learn from some of the experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: training extraordinary arms. The Velociraptor Legion of the Kingdom of Iberia is of great reference value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson wanted to send people deep into the Ural Mountains to catch Warcraft. But in the end, rationality prevailed. If wild monsters were so easy to catch, extraordinary units would already be flying all over the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Orc Empire, you can see that even though the Ula Mountains are entrenched with a large number of monsters, they haven't seen many extraordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of financial investment is one aspect, and the difficulty of domestication is also an important reason. The knowledge in these aspects is strictly blocked by the major forces, and there is no reliable experience to spread to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The well-known stories are all mythological stories in which epic heroes enter the mountains and the monsters themselves cast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson is also the lucky one in the story. If he didn't know how to fool Bear Stearns, he might have believed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if a contract is signed, it doesn't mean that Warcraft is willing to obey orders. If you are in a bad mood, you can also quit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the soldiers know the evaluation of His Excellency the Earl, they will be very happy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur unceremoniously accepted all of Hudson's compliments. Modesty does not exist. In the continent of Aslante, confident recognition is the embodiment of tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short exchange, Hudson decisively changed the topic to the topic of this visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, the Alliance Council has been unable to make a resolution for so long, so delaying is not an option!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to make a fortune is gone, and there are only a handful of nobles who continue to miss the battlefield. Most of the nobles in the coalition army now want to go home with glory and enjoy life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to visit the Marquis of Olafur because he is also the one who is eager to return home. The war was not over yet, and there were more Yingyingyanyans in the barracks, obviously a general who liked to enjoy life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what do you mean?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the barracks, many things are inconvenient. Worried that the officers below would follow suit, even if he captured many beautiful girls of different races, he would not dare to have too much fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, the gentlemen in the parliament have been unable to make a decision for a long time, and I think it is necessary to push.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much the Alliance Council is willing to pay, we can't decide. However, issuing a reward order in the name of the coalition to attract mercenaries from all over the mainland to join the war is still within our purview. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a side-ball, and it doesn't violate the principle. For the nobles, it's not a big deal at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this is a big matter. I'm afraid it's not something I can decide. Without the approval of the Alliance Council, if we make a decision without authorization, there may be a lot of hidden dangers in the future!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur said slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He can bear some responsibilities, but if he leaves this loophole, he will inevitably be made things difficult by his political opponents after returning to China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to return to China in order to end the war early is a question worth struggling with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, you can rest assured about these issues. We can completely adopt the method of anonymous voting, and the coalition command will make a decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are criticisms from the outside world, we still make decisions within the scope of our authority. After the war, everyone is a hero of the human race. Who would dare to deliberately make things difficult for some trivial matters? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it easily, but deep down in his heart, Hudson knew very well the far-reaching impact this matter could have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the bright side, it seemed that it was just a side shot, but in fact it opened Pandora's box.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Issuing a reward order in the name of the coalition command does not seem to affect the results of the discussion in the coalition council. But in fact, it is creating an established fact and forcing the Human Race Alliance to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unit price of the reward has come out, is the total price discussed by the parliament still important? Anyway, for the decision made by the coalition command, it is the coalition parliament that is finally responsible for paying the bill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pleasant way of saying this: This is the general who is out and has the right to make decisions on the fly\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another way of thinking to understand, that is a typical \"below overcomes above\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was in a feudal dynasty with unprecedented concentration of power, Hudson would never dare to do this. Even if the law does not punish the public, he, the one who started the agitation, will not have any good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is special, the Terran Alliance is just a loose group. It seems that a group of parliamentarians are arguing, but in fact it is a game between major forces in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the general of the Alpha Kingdom, it is completely correct politically to promote decisions that are beneficial to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Could it be that Your Excellency the Earl has already gained the support of all parties?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis, no one will refuse a proposal that is beneficial to him. Once the reward order is issued, not only the mercenaries will benefit, but the coalition forces will also benefit from it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person, no need to explain in detail, just make eye contact, and you can understand what Hudson means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mercenaries can exchange the heads of orcs for bounties, and the coalition forces on the front line can also participate. It's nothing more than taking off the military uniform and putting on the mercenary vest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the increased military expenditure, that is the problem of the entire human race alliance, but the benefits belong to the frontline officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces are all vested interests. As long as this kind of proposal enters the voting stage, it will be problematic if it cannot be passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it wasn't for their sanity, they would have organized masters to slay the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sea Clan found it, and helped to pull the thread. It's a pity that Maxim helped to pull the hatred thread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finding the location of the King's Court of the Murlocs, the old Eagleman was just about to go to call for a visit, but he was hunted down by the Murlocs and almost couldn't come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who told Maxim to bring him there?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eagle pretends to be a dragon, which seems to scare the shrimp tribe, but the murloc court is more deterrent to the shrimp tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's arrest warrant was not spread all over the world, but the sea tribes with a radius of thousands of miles have all received the notice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the red dragon showed up, news spread to the Murloc Court immediately. The angry murloc didn't dare to look for Maxim's bad luck, so he could only vent his anger on the old Yingman who came over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's to show your identity. If the old man Yingman didn't react fast enough, the whole eagle would be fed to the fish now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Sea Clan's way, I'm afraid it won't work. Unless we have a bargaining chip in our hands that they can't give up, we can use it to make a deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't understand the situation in the sea. Even if an agreement is reached, the Murloc Kingdom may not have the strength to block the transport ships of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows about Fengyue Port. Obviously we destroyed the channel, but the magicians from the human race came over and cleared the channel faster than we destroyed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to ancient legend, the more creatures living in the depths of the ocean, the more terrifying they are. The Murloc Kingdom is entrenched in the shallow sea area, and its own strength is not much stronger than it should be! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things got messed up, but it was Maxim's fault, not his little brother's bad work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had known that the Red Dragon had a grudge against the murloc tribe after looting, they would never let that idiot help them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send envoys again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it. The sea people do not deal with the mainland races, which is caused by many factors. Without an intermediary, they didn't even have a chance to meet the Murloc King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the human race can navigate the sea is not because of the mercy of the sea race, but because of their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor doesn't need to think too much, it was an attempt, and failure is expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to expecting the intervention of various ethnic groups in the mainland, it is more important to rely on our own efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the recent battle, everyone fought very well. Without paying heavy casualties, the human coalition forces were still blocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next is the stage of strategic stalemate, where the competition is endurance. As long as we can hold our ground and slowly grind against the enemy with the help of favorable terrain, we will be able to win the final victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you persist for another year at most, the Terran coalition forces will be forced to withdraw from the front line due to internal conflicts! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pot of chicken soup was poured down, everyone's faces looked much better. But Alex, who spoke to comfort everyone, was crying secretly in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it can drag down the Human Race Alliance. Anyway, if it drags on like this, the sparsely populated Beamon clan will most likely be finished first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line did win a lot of victories, but the protagonists of the war were all orcs, which was equivalent to fighting among themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the situation deteriorated, the five royal families had fewer and fewer cannon fodder troops, but more and more orc tribes were being fooled by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, it may not be long before it will become a war of orcs against the rule of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just delaying time is not enough, the enemy's family background is much stronger than ours, we must take more active measures to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a long battle line, it is difficult for the human coalition forces to look after each other head to tail. There are always weak points that can be exploited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, the human race seems to be preparing to increase its troops again. A few days ago, we conducted a soul torture on the captured Terran officer. He confessed that the enemy is preparing to recruit more mercenaries to join the battle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the lion king's voice fell, the faces of all the emperors changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human mercenaries have never been pure mercenaries. In addition to helping people fight wars, they also opened up many side jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Before the outbreak of the war, the smuggling team active between the Orc Empire and the Alpha Kingdom, and the gang of evil slave traders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the latter, they hate it deeply, and have organized troops to suppress it many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that none of these slave traders are slippery. He ran away when he encountered a large army, and reappeared as soon as the suppression operation was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to kill more people. Driven by profit, there will always be a steady stream of slave hunting teams appearing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Human Race Alliance is willing to spend, it is estimated that all the human race mercenary regiments in the whole continent will come to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys are not the army, and they don't have any aristocratic baggage. When fighting a war, it has always been as effective as possible, and various methods can be used without any burden on the mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan was discovered by the orcs, which did not affect the release of the reward order at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On October 10, 99989 in the sacred calendar, the Terran Allied Command passed an anonymous vote and passed the \"Mercenary Recruitment Order\" with an absolute majority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous recruitment method, this time it is to pay for the head. It's all about killing more and taking more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are naturally different pricing standards for different orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adult Beamon Cavalry: 100 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Old, weak, women and children: 20 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adult Hawkman: 50 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Old, weak, women and children: 5 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adult Lionman, Bearman, Silvermoon Werewolf: 30 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Old, weak, women and children: 5 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cannon fodder races are not accepted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such targeted and differentiated pricing is naturally written by Hudson. All the reward prices can stand the test.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of Beamon is the highest. In addition to their strongest combat effectiveness, the more important reason is that there are fewer people in the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and the number of their small population is estimated to be less than 200,000, and the number of young and strong cavalry is even smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the heads were cut off and exchanged for rewards, it would only be a few million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few million gold coins can be used to destroy an orc royal family, no one can refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Setting such a price was aimed at destroying the Beamon family from the very beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagles are expensive because they can fly and are hard to kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is another reason that cannot be said: several powerful forces in the Air Force are deliberately promoting it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everywhere is unavoidable, and the coalition forces are no exception. When the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See have the same position, normal people will not jump out to oppose it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reward price for the eagle who cannot fly is much more normal, the same price as the other royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm, the coalition also promised: the heads of the top ten mercenary regiments who killed the most enemies will be awarded the title of nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal mercenaries who rank in the top 500 can also obtain the title of nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rank of knighthood is determined by the specific record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to cross classes arise. For commoners, this is the best chance to become a nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a deserted aristocratic castle in the Northland, the core members of the July Society gathered again. It's just that they are much more embarrassed this time than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the assassin is not so easy to participate. Even if they deliberately dumped the blame on the northern nobles, they were still affected by Chiyu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The left-behind officials have strengthened security control. Countless members of the July Society were fined and sent to the front line because of idleness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is not that they are lazy, but mainly because of the war, which caused their smuggling business and slave hunting business to be suspended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid being hunted down by the five major families in the North, most members of the July Club used false identities when they were active outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such identities guaranteed personal safety to a certain extent, and also cut off their way into the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, this cut off their way to become officers. If you just want to be a soldier, the identity verification is still not strict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that doesn't make any sense. After losing his noble status, it is too difficult to re-enter the noble circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the north have great influence in the army. The remnants of these hostile families couldn't get along in the army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is mainly Hudson's fault, they are just caught in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rise of the Koslow family, the five major families didn't care about them, the fallen nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This situation lasted until Hudson became the coach of the army, and there was a slight respite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is still full of risks, after all, the county magistrate is not as good as the current one. The commander-in-chief of the army can't take care of all aspects. With Hudson watching, the people below dare not deliberately let them die, but the dirty work will inevitably fall on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to avoid this kind of suppression, unless you go directly to Hudson's command. In fact, this is also the choice of most of the declining nobles in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this does not include the leaders of the July meeting. It's not a question of being able to bend or stretch. The main reason is that they have ghosts in their hearts, worrying that they will be ruined when they enter the army, and they will not even have a chance to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"President, the coalition forces have issued a mercenary recruitment order. This is our best chance to change our identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many mercenaries, no matter how powerful the five major families in the Northland are, they don't have the ability to investigate them one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly earn military exploits as a mercenary, re-enter the ranks of the nobles, temporarily seal the past, and wait for the future to haggle with the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A young man said enthusiastically. It was as if his noble status was already beckoning, and he was just a step away from becoming the new noble lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mateo, things are not as simple as you imagined. Just look at the rewards offered by the coalition forces. Even you are tempted. I'm afraid it won't be long before mercenaries from all over the continent will pour in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is becoming the top ten mercenary regiments with the highest combat achievements, or entering the top 500 personal records, they all face cruel competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, those aristocratic gentlemen in the coalition army are really so peaceful and won't reach out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps most of the titles have already been booked in advance, and the rest are left for everyone to compete for! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man headed shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really knows the morals of nobles very well. There are huge benefits, if you don't get a hand in it, is it still a nobleman?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't play petty tricks, everyone will compete fairly. The network resources and strength possessed by nobles are not comparable to ordinary mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like those mercenary regiments, if they concentrate their efforts to pile up the military exploits on individuals, they may still be able to compete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone wants to seize this opportunity to cross classes and compete with each other without giving in, the final outcome is likely to fall on the battlefield, and only a few lucky ones can go home with the bounty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary mercenaries are like this, and the July Club is no exception. It would not be difficult if we concentrated our efforts to push a few nobles out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that most of the members of the July Club are the children of nobles. After so many years of silence, everyone wants to return to the noble camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the fief may be a little remote, it can't stop everyone's enthusiasm. If these issues are not dealt with properly, the July Meeting may collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"President, the situation is not so serious. I have inquired about it. All the new nobles born this time have their fiefdoms in the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If those nobles want to, relying on their previous military achievements, it is enough for them to install family children, and they will not come to fight with us at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it is also the orc prairie, and the fiefdoms are also divided into grades and grades. They take the best land and leave us a mouthful of soup too.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, borders still need to be guarded. The orcs have already retreated to the northwest region. It is difficult for the coalition forces to wipe out the enemies. There is still pressure on the future border. This is our opportunity! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mateo fights hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This news was secretly delivered by members of the July Club who joined the coalition forces. There are indeed many great nobles in the coalition army, who have no interest in the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the coalition headquarters is not interested in carve up the orc prairie. If the aristocrats and lords had taken a fancy to this place, the war would not have dragged on for such a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"President, the current situation in the Alpha Kingdom is tense, and it is not suitable for us to take any action for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is idle, why not let our people try it. Even if the hopeless earl and viscount can give birth to a few barons and knights, it is not a loss to the organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the foundation has been laid, we can secretly recruit troops and buy horses, constantly accumulating strength and waiting for the right time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the Alpha Kingdom is bound to stage a battle between dragons and tigers after the war. If we provoked it again, there might be a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, as long as we jump out and stab the five major families in the North at the critical moment of the struggle between the parties, we will be able to make them decline slowly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Long Xi's voice fell, everyone's emotions rose. It's really not easy. In order to avenge the five major families in the Northland, everyone has worked hard for so many years, and now they finally see a glimmer of light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man headed, although smiling, but deep down in his heart, he has already cursed countless times: Idiot! It's all a bunch of idiots!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chance of success is based on the stupidity of the enemy. Recruiting soldiers and buying horses is easy to say, but if you really implement it, you will find that this is not something that the little nobles have the capital to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is an internal change in the Alpha Kingdom, it is not their turn to jump out and pick peaches. At most, it would drag the five major families back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to explain this kind of thing. For the members of the July Society who have blood feuds with the five major families in the Northland, things that can slow down the enemy are already worth doing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all! Since you want to try it, then go and try it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this trip is full of risks, you must be careful and never reveal your identity. Contact with each other should be minimized as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, by the way, also provoke the relationship between the five major families and other nobles in the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, the old man turned around and left, disappearing from everyone's sight in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influence of the recruitment order continues to spread. Not only organizations like the July Society have been hit, but the mercenary group has been even more affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was eating blood from the edge of the knife, and I was working hard wherever I went. Now there is an extra future, which is even more attractive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the recruitment order of the coalition forces was issued, the entire mercenary world has been boiling. Every day, mercenaries from all over the mainland continue to pour into the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the soaring number of mercenaries, Hudson is also under great pressure. Pay according to performance, but you have to take care of food first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst thing is that the mercenaries who used to assist in the delivery of food and grass have also come to resign at this moment, and they want to go to the front line to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to stop him. If he hadn't been concerned about his position in the coalition forces, everyone would have left him alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson can only draw big cakes for them. Hint to everyone: As long as the food and grass on hand are delivered, it will be half of the logistics department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, he will go to the battlefield to make a fortune. In the future, when the military exploits are approved and the title is determined, he, the logistics commander, will help everyone win it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on coaxing and flicking, they finally calmed people's hearts temporarily, and there was no embarrassing incident of running away halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this can only temporarily relieve the pressure. After these people finish the task at hand and leave, someone has to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the military meeting of the logistics department, the faces of all the great nobles were very ugly. Ever since the mercenary recruitment order was issued, everyone watched the coalition forces eat meat in front, but they could only transport food in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It feels like I have lost millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to send someone to take a share of the action, the heavy logistical pressure forcibly cut off all their small thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Honorable Earl of Hudson, it won't work like this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia spoke first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolled his eyes secretly, Hudson didn't even want to answer. Everyone knew that this was not going to work, but the problem was that someone had to be responsible for transporting the food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, I don't know what the Duke of Cavadia has to say?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Duke Cavadia's turn to be dumbfounded for a moment. Damn Gao, if there was a way to deal with it, he would have already said it, why bother playing football here?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luckily, everyone paid everything for this war, but all the benefits now have been taken away by the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, we should have a share of the profits from the front line! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what Duke Cavadia said, Hudson smiled slightly. It's just the disdain in his eyes that still revealed his true thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given a hint to Marquis James, who was on the side, Hudson decisively retreated behind the scenes, watching them perform quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Your Excellency the Duke has such an idea, why not let Your Excellency be responsible for this matter!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for major affairs, the coach Hudson will intervene. He, the deputy commander, completed the communication and coordination between the logistics department and the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now if he wants to go to the tiger's mouth to grab food, the hard work will definitely fall on him. Worse still, this is an impossible task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition army is not a soft persimmon. Others have eaten the meat in their stomachs, so why should they share it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ball was kicked back again, and the atmosphere in the room became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that this meeting is not just about watching the coalition forces eat meat and everyone is jealous, but also a deeper power struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the war is coming to an end, it is time to work together for their own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Duke of Cavadia's sudden attack was obviously planned for a long time, but Hudson was not easy to mess with, so he moved around casually, and the two deputy commanders started to do it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is indeed envious of the profits of the coalition forces, but it does not mean that all the great nobles are fools and are willing to be used by the Duke of Cavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the ball was kicked back and forth, most of the nobles who had thought about it calmed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cake at the front line is really big, and there are many people who can share it together. Even if they go there, they may not be able to take much away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The simplest example, a Beamon army is placed in front of them, can they eat it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's a legion, maybe a cavalry regiment is placed in front of you, and there are not many nobles who can eat it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the reward for destroying a Beamon cavalry regiment is only 100,000 gold coins. For such a small amount of money, it is obviously not worth taking the family's private army to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are huge, and that is based on the fact that the orcs are scattered. When the enemy appears in an organized system, the benefits are equal to the risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, it is more important to maintain the internal power balance of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brief trial failed, and the Duke of Kavadia just kept silent. Obviously, things are not over yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, this is just an appetizer for the changes in the kingdom, and there will be more bad things happening in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, this matter is over!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the front line is very favorable to us. The destruction of the orc empire is imminent. This is the common wish of the martyrs of the Alpha Kingdom, and no one is allowed to destroy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I hope that everyone will not be blinded by some petty gains, influenced by some greedy idiots, and do stupid things that are not in the interests of the kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next task for everyone is to guarantee the logistics of the frontline coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the practical issues, I will issue an announcement in the name of the logistics department to fix the location where the mercenaries receive food and grass, so as to reduce the pressure on logistics transportation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson unceremoniously buckled the big hat, and brought out the deployment arrangements that were connected by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that it's time to turn your face, it's natural to attack the enemy's reputation. No matter what the Duke of Cavadia thinks, if you want to be stunned, you have to put it on him first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Duke Cavadia is not stupid, and he didn't jump out to refute on the spot. Otherwise, if there is a check mark, the label will be even more deadly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The atmosphere in the venue at this moment is very strange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces on the front line cut first and played later, which really gave them a blow to the head. The game doesn't play like this, they are the highest authority of the human race!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world is ups and downs, and members of parliament don't need to care, the human race has enough strength to withstand the wind and rain. But the backstab of one's own people, then there is no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of the anonymous vote was unanimously approved. It was simply telling them that the generals on the front line all supported the recruitment of mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At any rate, there must be a few negative votes, so let's have a little fun!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those who kept saying no, why did they also vote for it when it came to the final vote?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that benefits can make people \"conscientious\". In order to ensure the smooth passage of the resolution, everyone tacitly left the opportunity to vote against it to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Veto?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it. The announcement has been sent out, and if it is retracted at this time, isn't it telling the outside world that the Alliance Council and the Alliance Army are not of one mind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the Alliance Council has more power, but in fact their binding force on the frontline coalition forces is just that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status of most of the congressmen in their respective forces is not as good as that of the army commander sent to the front line. After all, the congressman is just an agent, and the coach himself is a powerful nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all colleagues, if there is a quarrel, it will be hard to see each other when we go back. But as the highest authority, they have to say nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only the congressmen who are embarrassed, but Charles III also has a headache. As the meeting initiator of the host, he disappeared directly from the venue this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is responsible, which means that no one is responsible. Everyone sat there staring at each other, no one was willing to speak first and pierce the window paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, the news has spread all over the continent, and it's too late even if you want to take it back. Why don't we directly discuss how to deal with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: to clarify the reward period; or to determine the criteria for the recognition of military exploits...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Predrag suggested with a little embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the law does not blame the public, the instigator is the Alpha Kingdom. If it weren't for Hudson's backlash, the coalition generals on the front line would not have realized so quickly the hidden benefits that could be brought by recruiting mercenaries to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fight once and receive two military merits. From now on, there is a high probability that it will become the norm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the subsequent battle reports of the coalition forces, they will all capture the area and wipe out tens of thousands of enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other side, the record of the mercenaries is all beheading Beamon's head, beheading bears...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the verification of combat achievements is still strict, it is still people who carry out the specific implementation. Driven by interests, things about pretending to be military leaders will become endless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the nobles on the front line still had a bit of integrity, and didn't include the ordinary orc race in the scope of rewards, otherwise the Terran Alliance might go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the mercenaries who are running to the front now. In fact, there are still many nobles of the human race who are also watching. As long as the Alliance Council does not object, they will also take part in the \"hunting\" with private troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Predrag is right, things have already happened, and we can only face reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in addition to considering the aftermath, we must also put a cage on the coalition forces on the front line, and we cannot allow them to toss around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, similar things will continue to emerge in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Djortevich said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he has realized the danger of \"below defeating the above\", and wants the Alliance Parliament to strengthen the binding force on the frontline coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Djortevich, the aftermath is easy to deal with, but the management of the coalition forces still needs to be considered in the long run. It is best for the major forces to strengthen their own constraints on their own armies!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson resolutely objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harm of the following gram is huge, but the harm of letting people interfere in the command of the Holy See army on the front line is also not too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Alliance Council, the royal faction has the upper hand. Once the parliament has command over the front-line troops, it will be logical to strengthen the authority of the coalition command and appoint the commander of the coalition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that the life and death of the front-line Holy See troops must be handed over to the royal power faction. What will happen next, no one can guarantee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the casualties of the Holy See army will definitely increase day by day. Even if the entire army is wiped out, it is not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that once this kind of thing sets a precedent and proves that these operations are indeed effective, the old practice will be followed in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time flies, and it's the end of the year again. The flames of war are still burning in the North Continent, and there is no sign of stopping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of a large number of mercenaries, the battle on the front line has become more intense. No one can tell the exact loss of the human race, but the number of orc royals killed has exploded compared to a few months ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People's potential is forced out. Under the temptation of profit, Hudson was stunned to see the various showy operations of the \"mercenaries\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Poisoning\", \"cursing\", \"natural disasters of the undead\", \"summoning evil gods\"... all kinds of unscrupulous methods, only unexpected and impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various combat methods have repeatedly broken the bottom line. The rules are that there are no rules, as long as you can kill the orcs, do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the decisive battle with the main force of the orcs, most of the mercenaries extended their black hands to the orc tribes, and the hunting targets were directly aimed at the old and weak with low combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no massacre of women and children, not because they had moral integrity, mainly because the price of selling slaves was higher than the reward price offered by the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What surprised Hudson the most was that the \"mercenary regiment\" with the highest results was not a real mercenary, but the vest of the frontline coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no big deal to use a vest trumpet for dirty work. But anyway, I have to cover it up. Hearing the names of those domineering mercenary regiments, Hudson was very speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: \"Holy Invincible Mercenary Group\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he heard the name, Hudson knew that it was a trumpet issued by the Holy See. Ninety-ninety percent of the organizations on the mainland that can be crowned with sacred titles are branches of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: \"The Mercenary Group of the First Kingdom in the Mainland\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The iconic character is so obvious that it can only be their own trumpet if they are not approached by the Frankish Kingdom to pursue infringement responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all vest mercenary regiments of the coalition army can be judged intuitively by their names.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A tossing about a family may be a show, and if everyone makes such a toss together, it can only be a benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing like this, eating looks really ugly, and it doesn't match the spirit preached by the nobles. But it is also conducive to everyone's identification and avoids many unnecessary conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no surprise, the mercenary regiments with the highest record are all vests of powerful forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the absence of a few unlucky people from the Northern Xinjiang region, the rest of the big clans are all on the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ranking is basically equal to the status of the major forces among the human race. Hudson didn't find a \"real mercenary group\" until he was over fifty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, after sending someone to investigate, it was discovered that the vest was made by a nobleman again. It's just that this vest is not opened now, but has existed many years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to study carefully, you will find that the mercenary regiments and chambers of commerce of a slightly higher level on the mainland can find the figures of great nobles behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grassroots Rise does exist, but after it develops to a certain level, it will inevitably be incorporated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the sequelae of knowledge monopoly. In the absence of education, it is difficult for ordinary people to play with those old foxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson wanted to take the opportunity to pick up a few potential mercenary regiments and secretly collect them under his command, but now he is still too young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things, everyone has been doing. On the surface, all of them are full of arrogance. They look down on civil armed groups like mercenaries, and they are secretly recruited more aggressively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mercenary group that shows a little bit of potential will have one or more nobles behind them who will become their shareholders behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Hudson noticed them, all of them were famous. Breaking the rules of the game for the sake of a mercenary regiment is obviously not worth the candle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't afford to mix, and Hudson doesn't force it. I simply started salted fish, providing logistics supplies for everyone with peace of mind, and by the way, I also started a small business part-time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold diggers can make money, and businessmen who provide services to gold diggers can also make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these transactions were successfully completed through cooperation with the chamber of commerce, it did not affect Hudson's distribution of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only trouble is that after entering the mountainous area to fight, the loss rate of logistics materials during transportation has skyrocketed, which has aroused close attention from all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, with the help of orcs, every once in a while, there will always be a transport convoy attacked, causing heavy losses in the logistics supplies of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't believe me, you can check the accounts. All the inbound data and outbound data can be matched. All losses are also traceable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, something is wrong! The Locknard family reported to the Alliance Council that you were reselling strategic materials, and the Alliance and the Kingdom sent investigation teams at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We will arrive at the front line in a few days to check the strategic material consumption of the army, so hurry up and deal with the accounts at hand! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news brought by Viscount Oran made Hudson slightly taken aback. The enemy chose to attack so quickly, and he was too impatient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Escorting logistics supplies these years is a serious chore. It is also an unspoken rule for the transport team to gain benefits from it. As long as it does not go too far, no one will care at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, I am most afraid of being truthful in everything. Once someone comes forward and reports by real name, it will be a big stain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be fatal or not depends purely on the amount of greedy supplies. Generally speaking, as long as the gap is not too large, accounts can be balanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's recent business has been booming, and it is inevitable that it will attract the attention of interested people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he couldn't figure out why the Lochnard family was so impatient, and jumped out to make trouble before the war was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially reporting directly to the Alliance Council is breaking the rules. Even if he could get him down this time, it would be a slap in the face of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the relationship between Caesar III and the nobles of the Northlands was tense, but now that something like this happened, wouldn't it be that the king's face was rubbed against the ground?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the king, but also the nobles of the entire Alpha Kingdom will lose their face. Under normal circumstances, when encountering such a thing, everyone would choose to close the door and deal with it by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Viscount, don't worry! They can't find anything. If the investigation team really comes, the bad luck will only be the nobles of the Northland themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the loss of food and grass transported by the nobles in various places, the loss in their hands is the largest. Even if the accounts are done well, there will be problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really get to the bottom of it, all the nobles on the front line will be more or less implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Duke Pias is not an idiot either. He would rather take the risk of offending many nobles in the kingdom to lift the cover at this time. There must be other forces behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's wait and see, I think the next story will be very exciting! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this report has a great impact on him. Even if the problem cannot be found, it will cause Hudson's reputation to be greatly damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are millions of officers and soldiers responsible for transporting food and grass. As long as you dig down, someone will definitely be caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A charge of poor supervision, Hudson is destined to be unable to escape. Before that, he was not completely unprepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the Duke of Cavadia showed his ambition, most of the dirty work hidden in the **** mission fell on the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the direct cause of the highest loss rate of their transport materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the investigation team arrives, the northern nobles with the most supplies will definitely be the focus of the review.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that with such constraints, they could be restrained, but they didn't expect that something would happen in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical \"kill one thousand enemies, self-damage eight hundred\" style of play. If we really want to investigate in depth, Hudson is not having a good life, and the nobles of the Northland can't hide from it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the five dukes did not reach out, who can guarantee that their clansmen and younger brothers did not reach out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are you sure there is no problem?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He knew that in recent days, Hudson secretly sold a lot of strategic materials and made a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the chamber of commerce is specifically responsible for the implementation, the inside story behind these cannot be hidden from the eyes of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Viscount, some of the strategic materials that flowed out were transported by me from the rear, and some were the spoils I bought from the coalition forces some time ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the relevant transaction certificates are kept in my hands. No matter how the investigation team investigates, I didn't reach out to the army's strategic materials! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these words were not only intended to be heard by Viscount Oran, but also to all the nobles in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reselling strategic materials is a fact, and there must be a reasonable statement about the source of the materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the crime of corrupting ink and reselling strategic materials is not a light one, and Hudson does not want to bear the injustice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the true and the false can be confused under the public opinion. He also needs someone to speak up and prove that this is not true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But the problem is that the current operation method is wrong, and the initiated process does not comply with the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most pitiful thing is that without the knowledge of his patriarch, the members of his family in the Alliance Parliament made the decision without authorization, and reported Hudson's corruption of logistics supplies to the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he can figure it out, what link went wrong. Trouble had already arrived, and the first person to come was not Hudson, the client, but an ally of the Locknard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pias, you have to give us an explanation today, why are you reporting to the Alliance Council at this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were three other dukes who came with him. The expressions of the four of them were surprisingly consistent, that is, there was nowhere to vent their anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reporting the coach Hudson is not a big problem in itself. But as an ally, this kind of thing must be notified in advance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brought the matter directly to the Alliance Council without making a sound, not only confused Hudson, the person concerned, but also a group of northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, everyone's **** is not cleaned. In terms of logistical materials, they have more or less extended their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it is traced, Hudson, as the coach, is certainly to blame, and they, the specific executors, are also not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if the coach is caught in this regard, it will be reported to the capital for internal handling, rather than bringing the problem to the alliance council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this wave is brought down, even if Hudson is brought down, most of the nobles in the kingdom will be implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention offending a large group of nobles in the kingdom, the position of logistics transportation \"captain\" may fall into the hands of other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Duke of Cavadia, please don't be angry. I am not very clear about this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the incident, I immediately ordered the recall of the clan members who were members of the alliance. After the matter is investigated clearly, we will definitely give you a satisfactory answer. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he knew he was wrong, Duke Pias lowered his posture very low, trying to keep a smiling face in front of his allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened this time was really too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that if the allies were not appeased, not only Hudson, the coach, but also the Lochnard family would also be pushed as scapegoats if they were greedy for money and sold strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unlikely that the family will be destroyed by death, but the family's reputation will be greatly damaged, and it will not be tolerated in the kingdom's noble circle, but it will happen with a high probability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pias, it's useless not to tell me these things. Things have already happened. Besides these things, even if we are willing to believe that you are innocent, will other nobles in the kingdom believe it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to cleanse your reputation is your own business for the Lochnard family. The misfortune was caused by you, and now we are responsible for dealing with the aftermath!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not much else to say, for the sake of allies for many years. You first find a way to fill up the huge deficit in our several accounts, and then talk about how to deal with the aftermath! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to recover the loss of prestige. It seems that it was only done by the Lochnard family, but who made the five nobles of the Northland always have the same spirit?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This account, everyone must also write down a sum for them. In this context, even if Hudson is pulled down, it will not be his turn to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political losses are now irreparable, but the economic losses, the Duke of Cavadia is not going to continue to be taken advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logistics and transportation, it is inevitable that there will be a deficit in the accounts. Part of it is caused by corruption; part of it is caused by special weather, special terrain, or sudden accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be recorded, it will naturally be recorded. However, the losses caused by many special circumstances are avoidable losses, and even the records are not convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there is no one to track down, just pass by. Once someone is serious, these unconvincing accounts are the best evidence that they are greedy for Mexican military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that they themselves are not clean and cannot withstand investigation at all. The best way now is to replenish the supplies before the investigation team arrives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the deficit is filled in, there will be no talk of greed. As members of the aristocratic world, everyone is relatively tolerant, and there are some flaws in the accounts that are nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Duke Pias' face changed drastically. The Lochnard family could still grit their teeth just to pay for the loss, but the question was, where would he go to raise enough supplies in a short time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that the various nobles in charge of logistics and transportation, including those from the Principality of Moxie, the Kingdom of Warhammer, and the Principality of Orton, are trying to make up for the shortfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the little supplies that are spilled out on the black market, and it's not enough for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to purchase and ship from the rear, there is simply no time in time. The speed of the investigation team's arrival was much faster than the speed of material transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the shortfall cannot be filled, the crime of embezzlement of Mexican military supplies cannot be avoided. Even if it is possible to arrange for his subordinates to take the blame, the aftermath cannot be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that this report, the Lochnard family offended all the nobles in the entire logistics system at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, you, Duke Pias, wish to tear up the brother who is a member of the parliament. The timing is so accurate, it is clearly the rhythm of killing the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I am very sorry for this incident. The Locknard family can accept everyone's loss. But it is beyond our ability to make up for the shortfall in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If only a few of us have problems, even if it's a waste of money, I will try my best to buy enough strategic materials from major chambers of commerce at high prices to make up for the shortfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is this accident, the news spread very fast, as if someone deliberately spread it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that everyone knows that the investigation team is coming, I am afraid that everyone is mobilizing their connections and buying supplies as much as possible to make up for the shortfall! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said with an aggrieved face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not terrible to have a deficit in the accounts, but the terrible thing is when the time comes: whoever has the biggest deficit will be embarrassed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lack of three to five hundred tons of strategic materials and the lack of thirty to fifty thousand tons of strategic materials are completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can understand the former, they all hang out in the same circle, and no one will hold on to it. The latter is a thunderous thunder, and I can't fill it in even if I want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, during the recent period, a group of northern nobles have indeed handled a lot of huge deficits in transportation accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many transportation routes are only a few hundred miles away, but the material consumption is an astronomical figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large part of the material consumption is due to the road construction in the early stage. Part of the loss was actually used to build roads, and part of the loss was due to orc attacks, or \"being\" attacked by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is currently no clear standard for the consumption of these materials, and it is also the best place to attack corrupt ink, and it is difficult to withstand verification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is usually slowly amortized on the subsequent transportation, so as not to look at the data and look unsightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Pias, we didn't mean to make things difficult for you when we came here today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, it was you, the Lochnard family, who reported corruption in the logistics department to the Terran Alliance. Everyone will keep this account on your heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most critical question now is whether you have any tangible evidence of Earl Hudson's embezzlement of Mexican military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need is tens of thousands of tons, worth millions of gold coins, and huge corruption, not the usual daily supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should know that the logistics and transportation tasks of the coalition forces are now split up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, the Earl of Hudson has not directly reached out to any of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that even if his corruption exists, it is limited to the materials transported by the headquarters, plus at most the materials escorted by the mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, he now represents the face of our Alpha Kingdom. As long as his food is not too ugly, the Kingdom will definitely find a way to keep him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time you report, you are just fooling around! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Agiron's words seemed plain, but they were full of distrust and reprimand. It is clear that dissatisfaction with the Locknard family has accumulated to a critical point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Duke Pias was also speechless. To him, this incident was purely an accident. He never thought of reporting corruption to the Terran Alliance in advance, so he would deliberately collect evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can rest assured. Judging from the shipments on the trading market, at least 30% of the strategic materials currently on the market flow out of the hands of Earl Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is only what can be seen on the bright side, and the real transaction figures behind it will only be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Earl of Hudson also purchased a large amount of strategic materials from the coalition forces before issuing the reward order, there were definitely not so many! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Duke Pias finished speaking, Duke Cavadia's face changed drastically, and he immediately exclaimed: \"Oops! Something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The massive recruitment of mercenaries to join the war was also promoted by Hudson. Combined with the previous purchase of strategic materials in the spoils of the coalition forces, it is obviously premeditated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the biggest buyer behind the black market's strategic material transactions, or the current dealer of strategic material transactions, is the Earl of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, at that time, there was not a large influx of mercenaries, and there were only a few business trips, which did not consume so much supplies!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the inference is correct, Hudson still has a large amount of strategic materials in his hands. Coupled with his close relationship with major chambers of commerce, it is also possible to make up for the shortfall in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias, hurry up and find out which forces your expatriate MPs have had contact with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this sudden incident seems to be aimed at the Earl of Hudson, maybe the real target of the enemy is us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guesses are not aimless. The trading platform was created by Hudson. At the beginning, it was just a trade in spoils. As time went by, it soon expanded to trade in all categories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, there was no perfect shipping channel. Even if someone dared to be greedy for Mexican military supplies, it would be difficult to realize it, so the loss of strategic materials along the way was not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This situation lasted until the trading platform was established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the terrain is bad, and the increase in material consumption caused by the increase in orc attacks is actually the emergence of cash channels, which arouses everyone's greed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the founder of the trading platform and the person in charge of logistics material delivery, instead of cracking down on private strategic material transactions, he provided cover for them. Hudson's behavior is obviously abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no commission for a penny, and the security of transactions is guaranteed for free. How can there be such a good thing in the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the biggest dealer in the black market is Hudson himself, then everything makes sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, he didn't make any money, but gained a reputation among the coalition forces; secretly, he made a lot of money. This kind of fame and fortune, of course, can continue to persist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just saw through Hudson's plan, and the Duke of Kavadia is powerless now. The current trading platform has tied the coalition forces together with benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the truth is revealed, everyone still has to go to do business. For the trading platform, it is cutting off the source of income for the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of reselling strategic materials, that is not a problem at all. From beginning to end, a group of vests were at the front, and Hudson did not end the trade in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In-depth investigation revealed that all the nobles in the coalition forces were dragged into the water. Either they will be held accountable together, or they will be the investigative team: turn a blind eye, close one eye and forget it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the accounts can be balanced, everyone can pretend that nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Human Race Alliance also has face. No one is really willing to expose their own scandals to all races in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Cavadia, I have already launched an investigation on this matter. However, since the mastermind behind the scenes has taken action against us, this is not the only way to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigative team is only a ostensible means, and I am afraid that it is more to provoke conflicts between us and the nobles in other parts of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Earl of Hudson retains his position as commander-in-chief, the next few days of our family will be difficult! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias tried hard to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get Hudson down, he also took great pains. Even though he knew it was a conspiracy by the mastermind behind the scenes, he still had no choice but to jump into the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are still being staged among the coalition forces. All the great nobles focused their attention on the reported incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the big nobles in charge of logistics and transportation, all of them gritted their teeth with hatred for the Lochnard family. The investigation team is coming soon, forcing everyone to find a way to make up for the shortfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money that has just entered the pocket, has not had time to warm up, and will be forced to take it out again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more pitiful is that before the arrival of mercenaries in large numbers, the transaction of strategic materials was a pure buyer's market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few buyers who are willing to buy, and the price is completely up to the buyer. The final transaction price was 30-50% lower than that in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the influx of mercenaries, the price of strategic materials on the market has already soared. There is a ready-made reason for the price increase: transportation costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all objective factors. If you really organize manpower to transport the materials from the rear to the front line, the cost will indeed increase significantly, and the price should be more expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, it is necessary to purchase a large amount of materials to fill the shortfall, which suddenly turns the trading market into a seller's market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone had time to sweep the goods, the price of strategic materials in the black market had already started to rise quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they changed hands, the nobles who could have made a fortune would lose everything at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some nobles with weak financial resources even directly started the bad mode. If you want to check it, just check it, anyway, they can't plug the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fame is very important, and military achievements are also very important, but I just have no money in my pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't because everyone was performing tasks separately, all the nobles in the Royal Army would have already waved their fists and ran to Duke Pias to settle accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, Hudson's tent became more and more lively. A group of nobles who were supposed to avoid suspicion, instead moved towards him one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many nobles involved in the case, Hudson, who was caught in the vortex of the storm, was \"one of his own\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone came to visit, naturally hoping that his coach can come forward and settle things down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For all this, Hudson is also very helpless. Originally, he just took the opportunity to make a small fortune and make a fortune from the mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But following a report, he suddenly discovered that it was much easier to earn money from his allies than from the pockets of mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send an order. Sell the strategic materials in our hands as soon as possible, the faster the better!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now as long as there are strategic materials, there is no need to worry about selling them. There is no such thing as hoarding and continuing to drive up prices. Hudson just wants to ship quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this deal is too profitable. One entry and one exit are at least three to five times the profit, and the profit of some special commodities can even be more than ten times the profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are bulk commodities, not comparable to bulk cargo. If you don't realize it quickly, someone might take the risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was very worried that in a desperate situation, someone would pretend to be an orc and directly transport the team to make up for the shortfall left in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hoards a large amount of strategic materials in his hands, even the trading platform he built may not be safe. It's not that he's afraid that someone will come over to steal it, but that Hudson is worried that he won't be able to bear the pressure from all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats, the biggest characteristic is knowing how to use privileges. When you find that you can't afford it, or you need to pay too much, there is another solution, which is to overturn the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, it is to directly take out the black market and confiscate the strategic materials in the hands of the merchants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who knows how the aristocrats play, will naturally not put himself in a dangerous situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, with the tiger skins of the coalition forces, even if the nobles of the kingdom have ideas, they will not choose to overturn the table immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the current black market trade includes not only strategic material transactions, but also various shady transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest seller was not the nobles of the kingdom who escorted the logistics supplies, but the coalition forces on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are both spoils of war and strategic materials they falsely reported. Overturning the table not only slapped them in the face, but also cut off their money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The prices of the items on the list have at least doubled compared to the previous prices, and some items have even increased several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the prices here are already considered cheap. To tell you the truth, since the news of the investigation team's imminent arrival spread, the prices of all strategic materials have been rising rapidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you need it, place an order quickly. Now the prices of the commodities here are adjusted three times a day. If you don't place an order now, it may be another price in the afternoon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to give you this price is already due to the pleasure of our previous cooperation. Otherwise, even if you have money, you can't buy the goods now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the middle-aged man made Earl Pierce half dead. Five days ago, he was selling a batch of strategic materials here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the sales price on the current list, the overall price difference in the middle is as much as five times. If the time is pushed forward, the price gap of strategic materials will be further widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Snyder, what you're doing is too dark! You're going to make five times as much profit as soon as you change hands, aren't you afraid of being choked to death?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, he would send troops to grab it. Dare to knock him on the head, it is simply not to take the Dalton family seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't rush to get angry. If you came here a few days ago, we would at most add 30% to 50% to the purchase price and sell it. If the quantity is large, there will be 20% to 30% profit, and the sale can be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the current situation is different. With the intervention of the investigation team, everyone is busy making up for the shortfall. Who dares to sell supplies on the black market?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must also know how difficult it is to transport strategic materials from the rear. The current situation in the black market is that every ton of strategic materials sold will decrease by one ton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to supplement from the rear, it will take several months at the earliest. If you can wait that long to come and buy, you can rest assured that it will not be much more expensive than the previous price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But not now, everyone is rushing to buy strategic materials to make up for the deficit. The current market prices have soared up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can also inquire about these trading rules. The price list we are giving you now is only based on the market price. If you think it is too expensive, you can go to other stores to see the price comparison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it doesn't matter where you're going to shop. It is best to place an order as soon as possible, otherwise there will be no market in the future, and you will not be able to buy it if you want to. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Snyder said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buy it if you like it, and the price will be higher if you don't buy it. Everything stems from profit. Stimulated by huge profits, everyone has long not known what fear is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the nobles are not easy to mess with, but that cannot prevent everyone from getting rich. Who can drive the chamber of commerce into the trading center, who doesn't have any backstage!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are afraid, don't mess around in the business world. When you can make money, you must make enough profits. If you are soft at this moment, you will never want to get rich for the rest of your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a \"beating worker\", Snyder dared not harm the interests of the \"behind the scenes\" just to sell Earl Pierce's face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stomped hard, Earl Pierce said bravely: \"No, I'll buy it! Here is the list, you prepare according to the materials above.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he had already handed over the parchment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a seller's market, buyers simply have no bargaining capital. Before entering here, Earl Pierce had already visited the nearby shops, and the prices were all about the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the supply of strategic materials on the black market is in short supply, and in the end there will definitely be people involved in corruption cases due to insufficient purchase of materials to make up the shortfall, he really dare not have too much hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After roughly looking at the list, Snyder shook his head: \"I'm very sorry, Your Excellency the Earl. We can't get all the strategic materials on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially arrows, disposable spears, throwing spears...these quick-consumables, the stocks in the entire black market are not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to buy, I can only help to coordinate with other merchants. I can't guarantee whether I can get the above quantity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And the price of the coordinated materials may be higher. The main reason is that you have too many supplies. I am afraid that since the opening of the trading center, it is the biggest customer! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing \"the biggest client\", Earl Pierce was so angry that he wanted to scold his mother. Where is he a big client, he is clearly a big wronged species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many materials to be purchased on the list, all because he has such a big deficit. I ate a lot before, and now I have to double it and spit it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really not that he is greedy, it's purely that the Dalton family suffered heavy losses in this war, and urgently needs to find a way to make up for the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coincidentally, he was assigned the good job of distributing strategic materials, which created an opportunity for him to act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, I was cautious, lest Hudson would take advantage of the problem and take the opportunity to trick him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Later, it was discovered that Hudson only looked at the ledger and did not check the warehouse at all, so he gradually became more courageous, and more and more strategic materials were resold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Earl Pierce ridiculed Hudson more than once for being too young, and he didn't even know these military skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the coach Hudson doesn't check the warehouse, and the investigation team will come to check!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are caught by your own people, at worst you will make up for the loss and pay a fine. If it is caught by the investigation team of the Human Race Alliance, it will become a political incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing face to the Terran Alliance, not only has to face the accountability of the coach, but also the multiple accountability of the alliance and the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the unfortunate event of becoming the biggest moth in the army, it is not impossible for the Human Race Alliance to hang on and be sent to the gallows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's coordinate! The speed must be fast, I have no time to waste here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, a messenger rushed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is an urgent order from the headquarters, ordering you to attend the high-level meeting of the logistics department!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Earl Pierce frowned even tighter. His intuition told him that Hudson held a logistics meeting at this time, and there must be no good things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I'll go there right away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Snyder, I'll leave the issue of supplies to you. This magic crystal card is a deposit, and I will pay the rest of the money when it is delivered!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business in the black market is so straightforward. Pay with one hand, deliver with one hand, no credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Earl Pierce said it easily, deep down, he was bleeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purchase price has greatly exceeded expectations, and this wave is completely bloody. Although the specific price has not been announced yet, it is roughly certain that in order to fill the hole this time, at least millions of gold coins will be paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the unlucky company of many nobles, he would probably be **** off. Even transporting logistics materials can cause losses, which is completely a historical precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What did you say?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Geoff, that **** actually disappeared at this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he wished to kill Geoff immediately, it was based on figuring out the ins and outs of the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person behind the scenes hadn't been found out yet, and the person concerned had disappeared, which made him even more passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When such a big event happened, the Lochnard family had to give an explanation to the nobles in the army. Now that the person suddenly disappeared, he couldn't tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The explanation is not clear, and there is no black hand behind the scenes to spread hatred, so the Locknard family has to bear all the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Offending so many people at once, Pias doubted very much whether his family could survive this turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Excellency the Duke. Earl Geoff disappeared in Lutetia after reporting to the Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have launched all the contacts in the Frankish Kingdom, but we still haven't found him, as if he disappeared out of thin air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the recent survey of Earl Geoff's communication situation, he has been extremely active in recent days and has had contact with more than 30 forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most noteworthy of these are: the people of the Holy See, the King's people, the Julyists, and the Daltons. Several of them have motives for planning this matter. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man replied with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just fell into the eyes of Duke Pias, this explanation is tantamount to no explanation. Four suspects were found at one time, and all of them had full motives. Who knows which force did this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he guessed right, he can't do anything. There is not enough evidence in hand, but it cannot convince a group of nobles whose interests have been damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Continue to investigate, we must find out who is behind the scenes. This kind of enemy is hiding in the dark, it is too dangerous!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the logistics camp, Hudson is busy receiving a group of mercenary representatives. The reason why everyone formed a group to come here is very simple. The price of strategic materials on the front line has soared, which has exceeded everyone's tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for some small and medium mercenary regiments, or individual mercenaries who walk alone, even if they have money in their hands, they may not be able to buy the strategic materials they want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The services provided by the coalition logistics are limited to temporary food management. The food standard is also the lowest standard for ordinary soldiers, and they want better treatment - pay for it themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, this is undoubtedly a heavy pressure on the mercenaries on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to be able to solve the problem, everyone naturally found Hudson, the head of the coalition logistics, and hoped that he could also be included in the coalition logistics support system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry everyone, the Alliance Parliament did not give a clear answer on the logistical support of the mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is perfectly reasonable for me personally to want better treatment, but it is beyond my purview.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most basic support provided by the logistics department is actually an illegal operation. Now someone has initiated a report to the Alliance Parliament, which is also one of the evidences accusing me of reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual situation is very clear to everyone. In the logistics camp, I have not received a single copper coin for the meals provided to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the expenses of this part of the account will be publicized every day. You can also see if anyone has skimped on it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson spread his hands, his face full of helplessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't want to solve the problems for the mercenaries, but the reality is cruel. In the absence of precedent, it is too difficult to do something practical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most basic camp food security was barely passed by Hudson at the coalition meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More welfare benefits, that is no need to think about it. Unless they defected to a certain powerful force, or made outstanding military exploits on the battlefield, it was impossible for them to receive the same treatment as the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the crime of reselling military supplies, it is purely a deliberate rhythm to attract hatred to the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it was a resolution passed at the coalition meeting, and no copper coin was paid, so how could it be regarded as \"reselling\"?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can't provide us with complete logistical support, everyone can understand. But you have to take care of the soaring prices now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of rye on the market has soared to 80 copper coins/lb; the price of cheap potatoes is as high as 35 copper coins/lb...The price of arrows is 29 silver coins/box.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, if this continues, we don't have to go out to fight. The harvest from the First World War is not enough to consume strategic materials. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adolf said with an aggrieved face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the representative of the mercenary guild, he must stand up and fight for the rights and interests of the mercenaries at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the mercenary guild doesn't have much say in the alliance and cannot influence the decision of the alliance. As a last resort, I can only find Hudson, the logistics manager.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency thinks highly of me. Although the trading market is located in the camp of the Logistics Department, it does not mean that I have the right to interfere with the prices inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current price surge is purely caused by panic buying. Everyone knows the specific reasons. At this time, I can't stop it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you ask a little bit, everyone can know the background of these buyers and sellers. Almost all the nobles in the coalition army were involved, no matter who reached out to them, it would not end well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you should find a way to publicize those powerful factions in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can get their support, the logistics department can provide you with a batch of military supplies at par or free of charge, all of which are negotiable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively chose to kick the ball.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of mercenaries, of course he is very envious. But these people are also good and bad, except for some mercenary groups who can see, the rest are a group of desperadoes with no moral bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in ruining one's plans to make a fortune for a group of forces that cannot be controlled. Anyway, free food is provided in the camp, and people will not be pushed to a dead end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Earl, for your reminder, please take care of me later. Now we still have something to do, so let's take our leave first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps aware of Hudson's perfunctory, Adolf decisively chose to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not entirely a waste of time, and there is no benevolence and righteousness in buying and selling. Unable to get help from the logistics department, but also figured out Hudson's position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's not a rumor, the Kingdom and the Terran Alliance have now sent investigation teams, and they will arrive at the front line soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is the specific executor of the logistics and transportation of the coalition forces. I think everyone knows what I have done since I took office, and whether I have been greedy for Mexican military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losses during the transportation of logistics materials will inevitably happen. Due to various emergencies on the battlefield, it is normal for the occasional wear and tear to exceed the limit, and the outbound and inbound data will not match.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are unspoken rules in the military, as long as the limit is not exceeded, generally no one will pursue it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is an exception.

I want to come to Your Excellency the Duke, and I will give you a satisfactory answer here! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the military meeting of the Logistics Department, Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigation team of the Terran Alliance came here not purely to investigate the reselling of logistics supplies, but there is a greater political significance behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, even if there is an investigation, people from several countries responsible for logistics and transportation will be recruited and sent to investigate together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, what Hudson heard was that the Terran Alliance sent an investigation team alone. They even excluded people from the four northern countries from the investigation team on the grounds of avoiding suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not surprised that the Principality of Mosi, the Kingdom of Warhammer, and the Principality of Orton received such treatment, but targeting the Kingdom of Alpha in this way is a bit too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most powerful country in the north, the Alpha Kingdom is also a powerful force among the entire human race. Even though his vitality is seriously injured now, he is still a big force among the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, with the status of the Alpha Kingdom in the Human Race Alliance, it is impossible for everyone to do things so absolutely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, since the coalition forces launched the counterattack to the present, there have been no major omissions in logistics, and the performance of the logistics department is absolutely excellent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era where heroes are judged by results, even if someone makes a report, the Alliance Council should suppress the problem first, and then slowly investigate after the war is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the investigation is being carried out in such a hurry, if the problem is really found, is it possible to replace all the excellent logistics department?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the investigation team has the courage, who can guarantee that after the replacement, the successor can do better than now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of a mess up later, because the logistics can't keep up and kill the coalition forces on the front line, who will bear the responsibility?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobility, there has never been an absolute right or wrong. The performance of the Alliance Council at this moment is obviously aimed at the distribution of benefits after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether they want to admit it or not, the Alpha Kingdom contributed the most to this war, followed by the Moxie Principality and the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to traditional practice, the country that pays the most should also take the biggest piece of cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is just an ideal state. As early as countless years ago, this model of fair distribution according to contribution was broken by a group of unruly guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is no exception. It is one thing for everyone to look down on the orc prairie, but it does not mean that everyone is willing to see that the Alpha Kingdom continues to expand to the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a fair distribution, the Alpha Kingdom can take at least one-third of the orc prairie, which is equivalent to doubling its territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a large territory, once it is developed. The Alpha Kingdom is really going to grow, and there is no force in the northern land that can check and balance them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Caesar III made a promise to give up the territorial claim on the orc prairie, everyone still can't rest assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just a verbal promise, which can be voided at any time. What's more, the Alpha Kingdom does not take an inch of land, which does not mean that the nobles of the kingdom do not participate in the division of spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a new country is divided, the broken bones are still connected. Relying on its geographical advantages, the Alpha Kingdom can still slowly annex the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the purpose of strategic checks and balances, other major human race forces must take action. Originally, everyone was still worrying about finding a reason to kick the Alpha Kingdom out of the game, but they didn't expect the opportunity to come right to their door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the fact that a group of nobles in the Alpha Kingdom participated in reselling strategic materials is confirmed, then everyone can logically kick them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the leading party, even if the Alpha Kingdom regains its strength, it will be difficult to complete the expansion to the orc prairie under the attention of the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The insider truth is all Hudson's personal speculation, so it is naturally impossible to say it openly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles present, even if they don't find the problem now, they will slowly figure it out after a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you know what you know, and this does not prevent Hudson from making use of the topic to draw hatred to Duke Pias. Since it is a world feud, it is natural to hate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps sensing the unfriendly gazes of everyone, Duke Pias hastily explained: \"Earl Hudson, I am also confused about this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, the report to the alliance has nothing to do with the Lochnard family, and even I only found out about it recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the news, I ordered the recall of that idiot Geoff immediately. It's a pity that it was still a step too late, and the person involved had already disappeared in the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the investigation of Geoff, we found that he has been in contact with many forces recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most noticeable thing is the cult July meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Geoff suddenly reported to the Alliance Council without informing the family, probably because he was controlled by a cult organization! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many suspects, but the best one to bully is July Club. In the absence of evidence, Duke Pias did not dare to offend anyone casually, so he could only pick out this soft persimmon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Pias, are you sure you're not joking?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone must be aware of how strict the review by the Alliance Council is. It is simply impossible to use evil methods to control congressmen to mix into the venue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was the handiwork of the cult July Society, it was because of Geoff's active cooperation that it was possible to avoid the inspection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The    person belongs to the Lochnard family, and represents the Lochnard family's seat in the alliance. Now that something has happened, just say it doesn't matter, do you think this is reasonable? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most pitiful existence, he no longer cared about the previous agreement with the Lochnard family. For this kind of pig teammate, he has lost interest in continuing to unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important to hit Hudson, but it also needs to pay attention to methods. Even if he reported to the kingdom that Hudson was greedy for military supplies, Earl Pierce would accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of disagreement directly pierced the sky and initiated a report to the Human Race Alliance Council. He really couldn't figure out what the Locknard family wanted to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't believe a word of Duke Pias's explanation, or he didn't want to believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Geoff is a core member of the Lochnard family, and also holds an important position as a member of the alliance, so he will definitely not lack expert protection by his side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very difficult for people from the July Society to get close to him, let alone use evil methods to control him and manipulate him to initiate a report in the Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it had been so powerful, the July Society would have turned the Alpha Kingdom upside down long ago, and it wouldn't be a cult organization until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to get rid of the blame, you have to choose a strong character, which is easier to be accepted by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, although the matter may seem unreasonable, it is indeed the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    伱Think about it, report the coach to the league council, such a taboo thing, what good does it do me? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias tried to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really can't bear this pot. From the murderous eyes of the nobles, it can be seen that today's meeting is a \"Hongmen Banquet\" against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the explanation is clear, the Lochnard family is still a great nobleman in the Alpha Kingdom;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Earl Pierce, who regained his rationality, did not continue to launch an \"offensive\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is a common enemy. If the Locknard family is really killed, it will not be of any benefit to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled knowingly. It is undoubtedly the most trouble-free way to let the two enemies confront each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The estrangement has been buried. In the future, if the two want to cooperate again, it will not be so easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Pias, since you have given an explanation now, I will trust you for now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the matter was caused by the Lochnard family after all, and the responsibility that should be borne is still indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My request is not high, as long as the Locknard family can make up for this loss, I don't have to worry about this matter! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Calais's skillful supplementation undoubtedly reminded all the nobles present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether there is a black hand behind the scenes, the Locknard family must be responsible for this matter. Otherwise, where will everyone go to make up for their losses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    July Society, the kind of cult organization that is so poor that it can only die. Even if they were caught, they wouldn't have the money to pay everyone for their losses!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Carles is right, this incident was triggered by the Lochnard family, so they must be responsible for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My request is not too high, as long as His Excellency the Duke can get enough strategic materials and balance the accounts with us, the matter will be over! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Martinez said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the third of the kingdom's twelve fiefdom earls forced the palace, and Hudson also roughly saw the existence of the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that these three are clearly politically united. Otherwise, they wouldn't jump out at this time and attack the Lochnard family together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this was also forced out by Hudson. Originally, everyone was just looking after each family, trying to make up for the shortfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the clarification of the mission by Hudson just now, everyone not only has to make up for their own shortfalls, but also has to pay the debts of the younger brothers under their command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, Earl Pierce became the biggest unlucky person. They are also nobles in the southeastern province, and have a lot of old friends and relatives. Naturally, Hudson will not take less care of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce received a fat job, and his younger brother also received a fat job. How cool it was when reselling strategic materials to make money, how miserable it is now when filling the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To suddenly spend a huge amount of money to make up for the shortfall, even the big nobles would be hurt, let alone the small and medium nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little brothers have no money, so they can only choose to show bad. The task of filling the hole fell on the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pit stepped on by the nobles in the southeastern province was too deep, and the hole left was too large. Even the wealthy and powerful Dalton family could not afford to take the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under desperation, Earl Pierce could only bite the Lochnard family, hoping to let the person directly responsible share the loss with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The herd effect is obvious. After someone took the lead, all the nobles present jumped out one after another, claiming damages from Duke Pias.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, please be quiet first. The Lochnard family is certainly to blame for this matter. It is only natural for them to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality, now also has to be considered. The biggest problem at present is the hoarding of profiteers, which leads to skyrocketing prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to solve this problem, I think Earl Hudson, there should be a better way! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment Duke Cavadia stood up, Hudson knew that what should come would eventually come. It's just that I didn't expect it to be so rude and simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't look at me like that, everyone must know what the trading platform represents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who has the confidence to do it should do it himself, I haven't lived enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Profitable merchants are not profiteers. Second, you should know how the goods on the black market come from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a long period of scattered transactions, most of the strategic materials flowing out of the army were scattered and sold to mercenaries, and it is estimated that they have almost been consumed by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Businessmen are not fools, even if there is a stockpile, it is impossible to have too much. Before that, no one knew that there would be idiots reporting to the Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to plug up all the holes for everyone with the few goods on the black market alone, and it may not even be able to fill a quarter of the holes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to balance the accounts, you must have a new source of goods. It is too late to transport from the rear, and everyone should know who is able to sell strategic materials now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two options in total, either you initiate your own connections and find a way to acquire strategic materials from them; or let the merchants do the transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, anyone who thinks they are strong enough can ignore the will of the coalition forces, or consider some idiot's proposal. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson mocked unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to be a banker in the black market, how could he be unprepared? This kind of shady business is destined to be hidden in the dark and cannot be verified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False and true, real and false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Hudson himself doesn't say how many forces are behind the trading platform, no one can figure it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like now, he can unscrupulously pull on the tiger's skin of the coalition forces. Wanting to take the opportunity to put pressure on him is purely funny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct characteristic of a great noble is that they have a big family and a big business. When doing things, you need to look forward and backward, and you can't let your temper do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to overturn the table, you have to see who is sitting on the table first. There are many sources of goods in the black market, Hudson is engaged in vests, and he is recruiting chambers of commerce, who can tell the difference?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the sales employees in the trading center, they don't know who they are working for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even who the real owner of the goods is has not yet been figured out, so no one will act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accidentally **** the wrong person and hit the iron plate, you will have to pay the price in blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Hudson fiercely, Duke Cavadia forcibly suppressed his anger. Reason told him that now is not the time to turn his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already cursed himself for being stupid. He didn't even know the enemy's hole cards, so he ran out foolishly to stand up for his allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the topic has been successfully shifted, but the way everyone looks at him has also changed. The look of caring for the mentally retarded really made him uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that today's incident will have a huge impact on his reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Labeled \"stupid\", the appeal in the aristocratic circle will inevitably be greatly reduced in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the analysis of the sequelae does not mean that he will be able to counter it. The painstakingly prepared offensive was resolved by Hudson before it had time to ferment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next question for everyone to consider is not whether to take away the black market and get back the materials sold before; but to find a way to make the black market merchants continue their efforts and raise more strategic materials for consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price issue, that's only secondary. The key is to have enough strategic materials in the market to help them gamble on the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to extract strategic materials from the coalition forces, you don't have to have money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Falsely reporting war damage, people also need to bear the responsibility. Especially in a short period of time, the risks are increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles who love their feathers don't care about them at all. After all, doing this kind of business is exposing your own handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most suitable operation is to let businessmen with backgrounds transfer them. How to operate is not important, the key is to have strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you have no better suggestions, then next, let's follow Earl Hudson's suggestion!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a word, everyone must plug the holes they made as soon as possible. This is what His Majesty the King meant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigation team sent by the Kingdom will arrive in ten days. I hope that everyone will have filled in the gaps by then, so as not to make us feel ashamed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James on the side opened his mouth and added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Such a good opportunity, you still let the Lochnard family go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what Marquis James said, Hudson laughed and said: \"Your Excellency, the most important thing now is to solve the problem of logistics deficit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything should be based on the overall situation, and personal grievances can be shelved and put aside first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already secretly rolled his eyes. Fuck the overall situation, if he could kill the Lochnard family, he would have done it long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the meeting just now, although everyone was clamoring fiercely, everyone's interest demands were for the Lochnard family to compensate for losses, and there was no intention of killing them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is sensible. Judging from the reaction of the Terran Alliance, everyone knows that there is a high probability that the Lochnard family has been tricked this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm a little sensible, and I'm going to report my coach secretly. Who would be a normal person to raise it publicly in the parliament?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffering from an innocent disaster, even if the Lochnard family is responsible, they are not guilty of death. Mixing in the same circle, everyone will naturally not do things to perfection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After gaining an insight into the thoughts of the nobles, Hudson will naturally not let them do what they want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really forced, Duke Pias is under pressure and agrees to take over the shortfall of everyone, then it becomes the uncle who owes the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the huge debt is not repaid, everyone will not watch the Locknard family have an accident. They only need to repay a nominal sum of money every year, and they are invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, your magnanimity may not be appreciated. The Northland gang is used to being greedy, and they must have reached out a lot this time. According to normal operations, it may be difficult for them to fill the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they take the risk next time and make troubles, I'm afraid you will be implicated too! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible to worry about Hudson. If Hudson can be pulled down this time, he will only be happy to see it happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this incident was caused by the Lochnard family, the northern nobles have always been regarded as a whole. If it is really pursued, the Duke of Cavadia can hardly be blamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss and the second in the army died together, and it was only logical that the third would be the backup coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, things are not that simple. Knowing that the investigation team of the Alliance is coming to the Alpha Kingdom, they can deceive others, but they can't fool Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king issued a death order, asking them to solve the problem before the investigation team arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with Hudson and the Duke of Cavadia, who have a higher degree of autonomy, James has no confidence in refusing to execute. Not only to solve the problem, but also to solve it beautifully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the meeting just now, Hudson was indeed solving the problem, but it also left hidden dangers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the view of Marquis James, since the strategic materials are insufficient and the hole is destined to be unable to be plugged, then a large scapegoat should be launched and take responsibility for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias, who has provoked public anger, is undoubtedly the best candidate, and the choice that can best preserve the kingdom's face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter! The deficit below is so big, I, the coach, don't know anything about it, and I should take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is my resignation letter. I have decided to resign to His Majesty the King and be responsible for this ineffective supervision! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson bit the words \"poor supervision\" very hard. The implication is very obvious: his problem is poor supervision, and it is impossible to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire logistics department has millions of soldiers and civilian husbands under its jurisdiction. If there are no problems, it is a real problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics pressure on the front line is so great, and it is not easy to keep the logistics system running normally. It would be too much to be critical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the investigation team of the Union Congress cannot deal with a meritorious coach just because someone under Hudson resells military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to play like that, no one will dare to lead troops. It was originally a team composed of noble private troops, each with considerable autonomy, and it was impossible for anyone to completely restrain the younger brothers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because the head coach is fine, doesn't mean the deputy commander is fine. If it is really necessary for someone with weight to take responsibility, Marquis James will be more likely to suffer from unwarranted disasters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this matter must never be done! This matter was not your responsibility in the first place, how could you resign because of this!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think we should try our best to solve the problem now. If it can't be solved, let Duke Pias take responsibility. You don't have to suffer for others! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis said nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been on the front line for so long, he knows how complicated the situation in the army is. If Hudson retreats at this time, he will not be able to fight the Duke of Cavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson just smiled slightly. The resignation letter still has to be submitted, which is a matter of attitude. Whether to approve or not is the king's business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, everyone is rushing to buy strategic materials to fill the pits, and the black market should be very short of stock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the actual situation is not as serious as everyone imagined. I can't guarantee whether all the holes can be blocked, but at least most of the nobles can get away with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deliberately creating the illusion of a severe shortage, naturally, is to take the opportunity to sell the strategic materials in hand at a good price, and by the way, weaken the financial resources of competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that Hudson did not participate in the reselling of military supplies does not mean that he did not take advantage of the opportunity. For example: using the logistics system to entrain private goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The materials transported by the great nobles are indeed strategic materials for the front line. However, a large part of the strategic materials escorted by the army brought by Hudson were private goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all strategic materials, all mixed together, and the people below don't know that the materials they escorted are also mixed with the coach's private goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is an accident on the road, what will be lost will always be the strategic materials of the coalition forces, not his private goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Falling into the eyes of the outside world, seeing strategic materials coming in and out, it is natural to suspect that Hudson is reselling military supplies. It is normal to be reported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the materials in the coalition warehouse that Hudson is in charge of always match up with the accounts. Even if there is a discrepancy, the error is within the normal range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only flaw lies in the chamber of commerce that provides strategic materials. But everyone shared the money together, and no one had any reason to jump out and smash their own business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone stabbed him out, the crime of carrying private goods is much lighter than reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Hudson will step down in despair at best. If you're lucky, you'll be able to stay in the post and commit crimes and meritorious deeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Businessmen who can participate in it will be sent to the gallows. It is useless to find someone to intercede, this is the world of nobles, and the rules of the game are all for the noble group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meeting of the logistics department ended, and the trading market suddenly became lively. All the nobles in the logistics system have joined the wave of snapping up strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's nerves are tense at the moment. Even if the supplies have been robbed, they still send heavy troops to **** them one by one, lest someone will not follow the rules and rob them halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the safety of the logistics transportation channel, Hudson also specially applied to the coalition command to send additional air patrol forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the probability of this kind of thing happening is still very low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to rob a transport team, but it is not so simple to transport the robbed strategic materials back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long convoy passed by, and it was impossible to leave no traces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the convoy of supplies coming in and out, Hudson was in a good mood. Even the sound of wheels rolling over became the sound of gold coins colliding in his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, when the first ray of sunlight entered the camp, Hudson, who had just woken up, met a group of relatives and friends who came to visit him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is the result of news fermentation. The great nobles are all busy filling in the holes, and it is inevitable that the tasks will be pushed down layer by layer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the big nobles have to pay joint and several liabilities for the losses of the nobles under their command, but in practice, few small and medium nobles dare to put it badly directly, waiting for the boss to help fill in the hole and deal with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am responsible for solving the things that I have created by myself. The normal operation of the logistics system is enough to prove that most nobles are clean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, they can't do it if they don't want to be clean. Not everyone is eligible to participate in reselling military supplies. Most of the minor nobles have no chance to reach out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who really participated in the reselling of military supplies were either relatives and friends of the great nobles, or their cronies. Only these people have the opportunity to be allocated fat jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Hudson is not immune. Although he restrained his own clansmen, he could not restrain relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people in front of them were actually affected by Chi Yu. It was originally a hole dug for the Dalton family, and many small and medium-sized nobles in the southeastern provinces were also passively recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that something has happened, everyone can only bite the bullet and come here for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the ashamed expressions on everyone's faces, Hudson was very satisfied in his heart, but his face was still gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One by one, you are really brave enough. You dare to participate in this kind of thing, and you are really not afraid of death!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nonsense, I won't listen. Let's each talk about how big the hole you made is, so I know what to do next! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson cast his gaze on Viscount Oran. Among the group of people in front of him, he, the father-in-law, has the closest relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the investigation team was also the first letter that people came to report. Although there is not much substantive significance, this love is still essential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The family is unfortunate. The Holliser family has a total deficit of 700 armor, 1,200 spears, 150 tons of grain, 500 pounds of salt, 5,000 feet of cloth, and 36,000 arrows...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the armor, I can find a way to make up five hundred. Food can also be squeezed slowly, but the remaining strategic materials, alas! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't stretch out his hand, because the Nai people didn't give enough. A little inattentive, he poked out the basket. The armor can be replenished by five hundred, all of which are taken from the soldiers of his own family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a tragedy to think about it. With such a small amount of supplies, the Holliser family is stumped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is placed in the lair, it can be gathered casually. It's a pity that this is the front line, and you can't have supplies if you have money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the trading market is very prosperous, but in order to make everyone pay willingly, they still play hunger marketing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make the show more realistic, in recent days, people from major chambers of commerce have been running to the front lines of the coalition forces every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who didn't know it thought that the supplies on the black market were really picked up from the frontline coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some did come out of the front, but that was a very small number. Knowing that the investigation team was coming, the nobles on the front line were also afraid of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Viscount, don't worry too much. If there is only such a gap in the Holliser family, as long as you are willing to spend money, it should not be difficult to fill the hole!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be comforting, but in fact it is drawing lines for everyone. The meaning is very obvious, he can find a solution for the supplies, but everyone has to pay for the money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Favors, Hudson wants to sell, but money also needs to be earned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price is still the price on the market, it is nothing more than finding his relationship and getting the goods in the shortest time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I've made it difficult for you this time. To be honest, I went to the trading center and walked around, and now all major chambers of commerce are out of stock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are some in stock, not everyone can buy them. This time I'm afraid you will have to pay a lot of favors! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran's words made Hudson very comfortable listening. It is obvious that the old man heard what he meant, and deliberately cooperated with him to set up a stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who originally wanted to use their connections to get some bargains changed their minds at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the background of short supply, if you want to get the goods, you have to pay for favors. If you want to buy cheap goods, it is too boring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of the aristocrats, the most expensive thing is always the debt of favor. The bigger the person, the more stingy he is to owe favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all my own family, these are what I should do. Your Excellency, Viscount, don't take these things to heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's talk about your own situation. As long as you can help, Hudson will do his best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom, grab a pen and paper and take notes! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, many nobles who heard the implication suddenly turned bitter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is right for your own family to help. If it is not your own family, it is natural to talk about the exchange of benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a favor, and the favor sent by Hudson is not of the same level as theirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that all the nobles present have a relationship with the Koslow family, but most of them are too far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least two-thirds of the nobles, Hudson couldn't call each other's name, and he didn't know their background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for coming with him, it is unknown whether he could enter his camp. After all, the threshold for Shuaiying is already high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a group of nobles continued to report their families and lack of supplies, Hudson's face gradually became ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know where these guys have the guts. Some simple people have no strength or connections, and they dare to imitate others and resell military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if I can't help but reach out, but I'm still so greedy. There are seven more holes than the Holliser family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the accumulated list, Hudson said angrily: \"The shortage of everyone's supplies has been counted. I can't guarantee whether I can buy them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all know the rules of the black market. There is no such thing as credit here, so prepare the money first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid long nights and dreams, tomorrow morning, I will help you make appointments with people from major chambers of commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation, I guess everyone knows it well, everything is up to the seller, and the buyer has no room for bargaining! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't have money, Hudson has it! But he couldn't say that by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want him to advance the funds, you need to pay a price. What you need to pay depends on what you have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all nobles, and Hudson is not afraid of everyone's repudiation. If it is really impossible to repay, isn't there still a fief?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to annex the fief, but as a creditor, it is reasonable to take away the income from the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Four, the current situation is not good, the Chamber of Commerce in the trading center seems to be deliberately targeting us!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have taken other people's orders, but when it comes to our orders, they are suddenly out of stock! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Duke Agiron deliberately glanced at Duke Cavadia and Duke Pias.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of situation can occur, and there is a high probability that it is the fault of these two. Who made them propose to search the black market when targeting Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to such a big hatred, you still want to buy goods from others, so there is no problem if you don't make things difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this moment, the two of them are also having a hard time. They thought that they could force Hudson to give up the black market with the help of everyone's pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan was good, but when it came time to implement it, new problems arose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has close ties with the black market, and a large number of nobles in the coalition army also have close ties with the black market. However, this kind of thing cannot be brought to the table after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone works together, it is not impossible to search, but unfortunately everyone is not as united as they expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After learning that the black market was short of supplies and that the cooperation of the nobles of the coalition forces at the front line was necessary to make up the supply gap, everyone was immediately discouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also greedy for ink and reselling military supplies, but everyone is facing a completely different situation. Not all the nobles are so greedy, desperately planing food into their own bowls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most nobles are restrained, the gap is not that big, and the hole can be filled by purchasing a batch of supplies. There's no point in going on an adventure with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Businessmen seek profits and deliberately make things difficult for us. They just want to take the opportunity to raise prices!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just be afraid, they are really out of stock now, not just making things difficult for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current plan, we can only do our best. If you really can't plug the hole, then you can only...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Better not to take that step. If it is done, no matter how clean it is, it will be difficult to guarantee that it will not be found out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this wave, he was severely beaten by Hudson. If it weren't for Hudson's long-term indulgence that made him relax his vigilance, he would definitely not be so easily led by the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pias, a giant dragon attacked your Locknard family a few days ago, have you found out why?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it really reaches the last step, this dragon may be able to use it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Dias' words seemed to open a new window for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you create an accident by yourself, it is easy to be found out, but what if an accident really happens?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 311": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 311: Investigative Team vs Burning Warehouse Case\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 311 The investigation team vs the burning case\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Help is endless. Ever since Hudson solved the shortfall of the first group of relatives and friends, his handsome camp has never been idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some relationships that were impossible to reach, all showed their abilities and leaned over. There is a constant stream of people coming and going every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business is always to be done, but it seems to be a lot more difficult. In many cases, materials are not available, and everyone needs to find a way from other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human affection, the harder it is to express, the more grateful it will be. Hudson, who is familiar with the world, will not take care of everything at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sense of urgency of being out of stock is constantly stimulating the nerves of the nobles. The nobleman who placed the order first filled the hole first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats who reacted a step slower will be miserable. Under the background of \"out of stock\" in the market, they have to use their own unique tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a shortage of food, let the soldiers under your command eat less; if the number of soldiers is insufficient, then draw them from your army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make up the number, some nobles even got through the relationship and paid in advance the food and grass for the soldiers under their command for the next three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding these small actions, Hudson directly chose to turn a blind eye and close one eye. No matter how you say it, everyone's spirit of making up for the deficit at any cost is still commendable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the people from the Kingdom Investigation Team have arrived at the camp. The leader of the team this time is the Minister of Military Affairs, Archduke Efiero. Judging from the posture, I am afraid that the visitor is not friendly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom reported nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without even saying hello, they rushed directly into the camp, obviously wanting to make a surprise attack on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not surprised by this situation. Now that he has been reported for corrupting ink and reselling military supplies, the investigation team naturally needs to be quick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the current team is only on the surface. There is also a team behind the scenes, which has already come to the front line to intervene in the investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already got up and walked out of the handsome camp. The Minister of Military Affairs leads the team himself, and he must give enough face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking from a distance, Hudson immediately greeted a familiar figure in the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Duke Afiero, welcome!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the enthusiasm, it doesn't look like being investigated at all, but more like meeting old friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the result of a sudden attack. If there is an advance notice, the main generals in the army will come to greet them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you are too polite! I really dare not accept this sincere welcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come here now, just to find fault with you. If something goes wrong, don't blame me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a hearty voice, it is difficult to make people feel bad. Even though he knew he was here to investigate him, Hudson was not angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grand Duke, you are joking. Hudson has been conscientious since he took office, and he dare not be negligent in the slightest. How can he be afraid of investigations!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke came to investigate this time, just to restore my innocence, to wash away the dirty water thrown by the treacherous villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, after the problem of reselling military supplies is found out, I hope that the Grand Duke can conduct an in-depth investigation and find out the villain behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My personal honor and disgrace are nothing, but the hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front line cannot bear this humiliation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing is not losing, everyone has already started to fill in the shortfall. Dragging the investigation team here first can be regarded as buying time for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this is an investigation by his own people, it is of little practical significance, but as the coach of the army, Hudson still hopes that the problems exposed by his subordinates will be smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Earl of Hudson said well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principle of the investigation team this time is: do not wrong a good person, and do not let a bad person go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who is responsible, we will investigate to the end and will never let anyone involved!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to leave an opportunity for the corrupt elements to take advantage of, Earl Hudson is troubled to bring up the accounts, and we will immediately start to check the accounts and check the inventory! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said without a doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smell of gunpowder at the scene suddenly became stronger. He didn't even participate in the Connecting Wind Banquet, so he started to check the accounts directly, obviously to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson had expected this kind of change. Not to be envied by others is a mediocrity, and a young coach like him is destined to inevitably attract hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the king, his handsome talent needs to be reused and constantly polished to remove the edges and corners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Grand Duke Efiero is playing the role of a villain. When the problem is found out, the king will come out to be a good person and help him to buy people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar imperial routines, Hudson has seen countless times in history books, so naturally he will not be angry with Grand Duke Afiero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's do it according to the Grand Duke's wishes. However, there are too many accounts in the army, and each army has its own logistics and transportation area, and the accounts are also accounted for separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they all move over, it will take a while to check. Why don't we start with the area I'm in charge of, and Tom sent someone to fetch the department's accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few transfer stations on the front line that have a small amount of stock in stock, most of the logistics materials that my headquarters are directly responsible for transporting are in this camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of convenience, I suggest that the investigation team directly take the photo album and check it with the materials in the camp. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, many members of the investigation team were dumbfounded. There are not many coaches who can cooperate like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats are arrogant, and being investigated if they are not trusted is a disgrace to many nobles. Even if there is no problem, they will resist the investigation to vent their dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly met a master who didn't play cards according to the routine, and Grand Duke Afiero didn't know whether to be happy or annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, there must be a demon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that there must be something wrong with the young coach in front of him; but reason told him that since Hudson dared to let go of all the restrictions and let them investigate, they would definitely not find anything now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the information collected before, he knew that even if Hudson had resold military supplies, he had now made up the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must be a good thing for the Alpha Kingdom that the problem of the coach cannot be found out, which means that the report is non-existent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the royal family, this is another matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is a result of his own hard work under the circumstances, not the \"own man\" cultivated by the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't grasp the opponent's handle, you want to grind away the opponent's edges and corners by beating, and then find a way to subdue the opponent slowly, which is basically not operable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After contemplating for a moment, Grand Duke Alfiero said calmly: \"Just do what Earl Hudson wants!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if he can't be caught, anyway, he doesn't want to be this villain. After all, Hudson's age is enough to spend many years in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really offended someone to death, he himself certainly doesn't care, but future generations have to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boring work of auditing accounts began, and one warehouse after another was constantly being opened, all of which were filled with supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the checks of detection magic, no abnormalities were found. Not to mention being greedy for ink and reselling military supplies, even the normal loss of supplies was well controlled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigative team arrived ahead of schedule and began to check the accounts. Like a storm, it quickly swept through the entire logistics department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical family happy and sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who made up the gap have turned into melon-eaters at this moment, just waiting to see the jokes of their colleagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles whose deficit was too great to fill the gap were already stomping their feet in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various methods to deal with inspections are constantly being invented, and it depends on whether they can stand the inspection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern noble camp, the faces of all the nobles are gloomy and terrifying at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really uncomfortable to watch a group of colleagues gather supplies, or they are gathering supplies, but they are the only ones who are in trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After entrusting favors to make peace, and paying a 30% premium over the market price, the chamber of commerce finally accepted the order. Unfortunately, they were ranked last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply: if there are any remaining strategic materials, sell them; if they don't, they will be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave did not suspect Hudson. The main reason is that the Dalton family has also purchased enough strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of the outside world, if Hudson is leading all this behind the scenes, he will definitely not do things for the enemy. As competitors, the Dalton family will definitely be targeted to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The passive situation in front of them is more like the deliberate revenge of the major chambers of commerce against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The current situation is very unfavorable to us. I don't know how much each of you has left. Anyway, in order to make up for the material gap, all the connections that the Felix family can mobilize have already been mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even I sent people to collect strategic materials from mercenaries, but unfortunately it was still a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the relationship with the frontline coalition forces has been established, they are more willing to cooperate with those profiteers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But those profiteers still have a grudge against us, none of them took our order seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also my responsibility. Not only underestimated Hudson before, but also underestimated the strength of the businessman, which caused the current situation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia reviewed with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave was really taught a lesson. Before that, he had no idea that the last bad thing was actually a group of businessmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that with their strength, they would completely skip these middlemen and directly deal with the major forces on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything is too beautiful. It is true that the mainland nobles are a family, but everyone has their own little calculations, and it is impossible to follow their plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was before, as long as the price is right, it doesn't matter if everyone cooperates. But now that the alliance investigation team is about to arrive, no one wants to touch that bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the relationship between one or two big nobles is established, it is just a false report of the war damage, and there are not many strategic materials that can be traded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they were caught by chance and found out together, they would be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, with more businessmen doing turnover, everything becomes different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Check\", that is, it was shipped from the rear. Major chambers of commerce can even provide the source of goods, and export data can be found at ports in various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how they were able to cross the vast prairie and transport a large amount of strategic materials to the front line, that is a commercial secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kavadia, things have happened, and holding people accountable won't solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Felix family has not been able to smooth out the deficit, and we are naturally powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let alone the small and medium-sized nobles who are attached to our family. One by one, they are either already broken or on the way to being broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the Koslow family's lack of background and the inability to reach out to the Frankish Kingdom, I would suspect that all of this was deliberately designed by Hudson, just waiting for our family to jump into the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the transportation tasks performed by several of our companies, all of them are full of difficulties and obstacles, and none of them have had it easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time we ship strategic materials, we only need to sign and ship, and even the most basic demand check is omitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it is deliberately guiding us to reach out to logistics materials. But if the logistics headquarters pay attention, no one dares to go too far!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I very much doubt that Hudson cooperated with a certain big force to jointly plan this political conspiracy against our northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation, the most suspicious person is our King. Otherwise, the Kingdom Investigation Team would not have come so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that they are busy investigating Hudson at the moment, I bet the final result of the investigation is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe in addition to the investigation team on the surface, there is also a secret investigation team that sneaked in early to collect evidence against us in secret. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you brainstorm, the more reasonable Duke Dias thinks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III directly endured the assassination of the king not long ago, and did not take any strong actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a monarch, if he keeps holding back and making no moves, he is holding back his big move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most unstable political group in the kingdom and the number one suspect, Caesar III has enough reasons to take them into action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reporting to the Human Race Alliance certainly made the Alpha Kingdom very embarrassed. But the intervention of the alliance investigation team also made them lose the confidence to overturn the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many human troops on the front line, no matter what the final result is, they can only choose to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several people looked at each other, and their faces changed drastically. If it was really the king's handwriting, once the other party caught the handle, then their life and death would be unpredictable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe Caesar III will take the opportunity to be ruthless and send them to meet the Lord of Dawn directly on the grounds of reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to take the initiative to be a decent person, you won't be able to keep your dignity in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to make trouble, the king can completely use the power of the human race alliance to uproot the families behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We cannot sit still!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether this is Caesar III's plan behind the scenes, he will never let us go with such a good opportunity!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crime of reselling military supplies can be borne by other nobles in the kingdom, but we are the only ones who will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's take extraordinary measures. At this time, I don't care so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An accident happened, at most it was our incompetence. At worst, he would lose his post in the army, be fined a huge sum of money, and then be driven home to retire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few years of silence, I can make a comeback. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said with a guilty conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The others are just suspects in the assassination case, but he is a real participant. Although he didn't carry it out personally, it was manipulated behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was done very covertly, who can guarantee that Caesar III will not find out about him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this kind of thing does not require tangible evidence. As long as there are signs that he was involved, that's enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, tell the Red Dragon to take action!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course he doesn't want to wear the hat of \"incompetence\". But the Felix family can't afford to gamble now. If his pillar is broken, the next generation will not be able to support the current family business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A flame that was tens of meters long sprayed out, and everywhere it went was a sea of ​​flames. The blazing flames continued to devour all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless soldiers guarding the warehouse were frightened by this tragic scene and fled in all directions, wishing their parents would have two more legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching helplessly that the camp fell into chaos, the masters of the army did not show up to stop it, and even the high-level generals did not come out to organize soldiers to fight back, completely allowing the red dragon to plunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, who watched countless human soldiers fleeing below and set fire to the ground, was very satisfied. This is the life of a giant dragon, and the previous failures were purely accidental.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has despised the human race countless times. Because of internal struggles, someone paid him to come over and burn his own barracks, which is nothing short of ridiculous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But because the other party's bid was high enough, he didn't care about it. After all, it is really hard to find such a big boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spewing flames for a while, throwing a big fireball for a while, Maxim was in the camp, having a great time playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five dukes who watched the battle hidden in the dark were bleeding from their hearts. They just hired the dragon to burn the warehouse, but they didn't let the dragon come over to kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that creatures like giant dragons are born to be destructive. There is no need to do anything deliberately, just normal arson will cause huge casualties to the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dragon in front of the high-level generals was hired by their own family to destroy the evidence, but the people below didn't know it, and they were still trying to drive the dragon away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim is obviously not a good-tempered dragon. If there are \"reptiles\" who dare to come and harass him, naturally he doesn't mind rewarding them with a tail!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fire dragon burning warehouse was carried out along with the killing. Such a big movement quickly attracted the attention of the Griffon cavalry patrolling in the distance, and the news was quickly passed on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A giant dragon suspected of being the Dragon King attacked the barracks?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson, you are sure you are not joking! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the suspicious gaze of Grand Duke Effiero, Hudson immediately explained: \"That's right, Your Excellency the Grand Duke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This news just came. A huge red dragon attacked the camp of the northern nobles and is currently plundering the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, this is not the first time this dragon has appeared. Before that, they also attacked the lair of the Lochnard family, but they were driven away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed a bit strange to come and attack our barracks now. But this question needs to be asked to the deputy commander, Duke Cavadia, who has always been in charge of the military affairs there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the intelligence of the Griffin Cavalry scouting, they seemed to have been frightened. There was no effective counterattack organized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neither the magic crystal cannon nor the magic crossbow were used, and the dragon was completely left to plunder. And this giant dragon seems to like setting fire very much, every time it catches our warehouse and burns it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the opportunity, Hudson handed over the rest to Archduke Afiero to make up the rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He already knew that the nobles of the Northland would make troubles, but he still didn't expect that these guys would play the classic \"Fire Dragon Burning Cang\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that their experience is still somewhat lacking, the methods seem too rough, and there are loopholes everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To do a full set of acting, at least the magic crystal cannon will sound, and the masters in the army must also move, pretending to be struggling to intercept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are also great risks here. Julong has never been a good actor, and if he accidentally loses his temper, it will turn into a fake show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fire dragons burning warehouses is a rare spectacle in the mainland. Earl Hudson, let's take people there to see it together, and we will take it as a way to gain knowledge!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is really angry. No accident early, no accident later, but an accident happened at such a juncture. What the gang of northern nobles did was clearly an insult to his IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But under the background that the holes cannot be filled, no matter how insulting the IQ is, it must be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to be suspected of reselling military supplies than to be investigated with solid evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 312": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 312: dog jumping wall\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 312 Dog Jumps Over the Wall\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large group of masters arrived on the battlefield, and all they saw were wreckage and ruins, and the shadow of the dragon had long since disappeared. Hurry up and hurry up, after all, it is still a step late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the group of \"injured\" northern nobles in front of him, the anger of Grand Duke Efiero was completely ignited, and he glared at everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's complexion is also not good-looking, his subordinates are so flamboyant, and his coach is also embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the warehouse that had been reduced to ruins, and after glancing at the Northland nobleman who was acting, he said sarcastically: \"Send the order down, seal the site immediately, and inspect the remains of the ruins!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who dares to destroy the scene will be punished as colluding with orcs, and the entire clan will be held accountable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The fire dragon burns the warehouse\", it must be burned cleanly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Materials such as food and cloth can be reduced to ashes in the fire, but even if the weapons and armor are burned, there must be something left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if the feet were fixed. Hudson's order was issued, but no one acted, and everyone was waiting for the order from their boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was not angry but happy. Don't listen to the command! It just happened to let Grand Duke Affiero see the arrogance and domineering of the northern nobles, and after passing it to the king's capital, it also reduced Caesar III's fear of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe realizing that the situation is not good, Duke Kavadia hastily remedied: \"Why are you so stupid, why don't you act quickly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Effierro, Earl of Hudson, you are one step too late, the dragon has already left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have recorded the portrait of the evil dragon, and we can organize the dragon slaying warriors at any time...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, Grand Duke Afiero interrupted: \"It doesn't need to be so troublesome, just send someone to catch the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, the burned materials were replenished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene is here, I am not a fool, I can see what happened by myself, I don't need you to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavadia, we have known each other for a long time. But this time, you have indeed done it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons for your preparations should be explained to the alliance investigation team! If you can fool the past, count your luck, otherwise you will know the consequences yourself! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each circle has its own rules of the game. This time, the \"Fire Dragon Burning Cang\", the nobles of the Northland really went too far, but if they want to convict them, they still need more evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ruins left at the scene are indeed flaws. But these evidences can only be used by themselves, and cannot be handed over to the joint investigation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the Alpha Kingdom is still a whole when it comes to the outside world. You can't stab your own people with knives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the fire just now destroyed not only the warehouse, but also the detailed account books for the entry and exit of logistics materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All relevant materials have been destroyed, and subsequent in-depth investigations are bound to be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nobles of the North cannot be convicted, then the responsibility can only be borne by the kingdom. One step closer to Hudson packing up and going home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it seems that he still can't run now. With a sudden change of personnel, what about the logistics of the coalition forces?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the issue of food, the coalition forces fighting on the front line will never allow major turmoil in logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unhappy meeting ended with Grand Duke Effiero waving his sleeves and leaving. Next, it depends on how the northern nobles deal with the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kill the dragon and wipe out the mouth\", it seems that the risk is so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having dealt with Maxim, Hudson knew that although he was a fledgling Dragon Clan rookie and lacked dragon life experience, his escape skills were not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you kill a dragon without dying, you will have endless troubles. Julong brand Laipi candy is definitely worth having.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respected Earl Hudson, please order to capture the evil red dragon and seek justice for the dead soldiers!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Duke Cavadia's shameless words, Hudson's anger also rose. He said \"please\" in name, but in fact he relied on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Learn history as a mirror. The case of the fire dragon burning the warehouse has never occurred only in the warehouse, and the officials in charge of the warehouse can't escape either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that it was created by the nobles of the Northland, Hudson still has to be jointly and severally liable. Although these are expected things, it does not mean that he is willing to accept them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I am the headquarters of the Wen coalition army, and I will do my best to arrest the evil dragon. I will definitely return the dead soldiers and be fair!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson shook his hands and left. A group of northern nobles were left staring blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Hudson actually performed poorly at this time, which really exceeded their expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The red dragon fell into the hands of the kingdom, and everyone covered the lid together. In the end, the case of burning warehouses was \"reduced from a big event to a small matter, and a small matter was turned into a small matter.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they fall into the hands of the league, the people involved in the case will of course be unlucky, and the coach Hudson will also lose his reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't dare to say anything else, with the taint of ineffective supervision and lax control, Hudson's Marshal Road, this wave must be hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turmoil in the logistics department did not affect the normal operations of the frontline army. The nobles of the Northland also had a sense of proportion, they burned empty warehouses, and no fools burned their supplies together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention other nobles, the holes in their own houses are barely plugged, so naturally they will not make trouble at such a critical point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The birth of the reward order greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the nobles in combat. The most unlucky ones were of course the Beamon clan. As the existence with the highest reward, it also attracted the strongest firepower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless small and medium tribes of Bimon were wiped out by the sudden intrusion of the \"mercenary group\" in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This method of cutting off children and grandchildren naturally made the Orc Empire furious. However, the strength is not good, and the coalition forces cannot be stopped at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to concentrate people and stick to the spot. The total population of the five royal families is tens of millions, and they can be dragged to death by relying on logistics together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scattered garrison, relying on favorable terrain to defend, is also a last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the opponents they encountered were too perverted. They were either powerful human coalition forces, or mercenaries who didn't follow the routine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Create conditions if there are no conditions. Poisoning water sources and setting fire to mountains are all routine operations. All kinds of messy evil gods also rushed out to join in the fun at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the continuously compiled battle reports, Hudson was surprised to find that the orc empire, which was originally bullish, was on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no false record, the worst Beamon clan is even on the verge of genocide. The remaining total population is estimated to be less than 50,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that it is worthy of the extraordinary world, and the efficiency of war is high. The orc royal family is one of five, and now it has become a foregone conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that Maxim has not been arrested for a long time. He is obviously a master in the coalition army and has not paid much attention to this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the northern nobles who are really busy with this. Whether to kill the dragon or tell Maxim to run away, no one can tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, after finishing this big job, Maxim's figure disappeared in the Ula Mountains, and no one knows where he is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until one day, Bear Stearns, who had gone out to play in the field, came back, and the news he brought back caught Hudson's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, are you sure you found the trace of the red dragon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the short-lived human race, if the dragon race wants to live forever, just dig a hole and sleep in it, decades will pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how big the pot is, with the passage of time, it will gradually become invisible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course, the days of that stupid dragon have been miserable recently. It is being chased and killed by a group of human masters. If they didn't want to catch it alive, it is estimated that a dragon meat feast can be held now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the clothes of those people, there is a big gap with your Alpha Kingdom, and it is estimated that they are people from other forces. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Bear Stearns' explanation, Hudson reacted instantly. The alliance's investigation team has been making trouble for so long, but they haven't arrived at the front line, which is obviously abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high probability is that these people have already come, but they are just hiding in the dark, secretly investigating the matter of reselling logistics supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, the nobles of the Northlands also acted as good people this time, successfully attracting the investigation team's attention to themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now sending people to catch the dragon is obviously to find the most favorable evidence, and it is logical to kick the Alpha Kingdom out of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hesitated whether to disclose the news. The temptation to capture a giant dragon alive is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially a newborn dragon like Maxim, who looks easy to fool at first glance, if he can fool him, it will be blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just the three words \"Dragon Knight\" can make people resound throughout the entire continent. The resulting appeal is enough to make Hudson take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, you continue to help me keep an eye on that giant dragon. Be careful, don't be discovered by the human masters who are chasing and killing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm going to summon the masters in the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the greatest advantage of being the commander-in-chief of the army is that he can use the power of the kingdom to seek personal gain for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons are all ready-made, and the Red Dragon cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other problems, as long as established facts are created, everyone can only pinch their noses and admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asking is luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Already picked up a bear of the earth, and then picked up a giant dragon, it seems to be justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the losses caused by the giant dragon, it is natural that the nobles of the north should pay for it. Spending money to hire others to work, can you still be irresponsible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeat of the Orc Empire in the past few days has consumed the last vitality of this ancient country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless old antiques that have been dusty for a long time are forced to appear on the battlefield. It's a pity that this is not their era after all, and often helping out means sleeping forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All strategies and tactics are futile in the face of absolute strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The strength of the human race is developing too fast, not only the rapid expansion of military strength, but also the strength of other aspects, far exceeding our expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, we were able to drag them down with logistics, but this time it was different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They not only occupied the sea outlet, shortened the transportation distance, but also greatly increased the number of transportation vehicles used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original ordinary carriage, after being depicted with a magic circle, its transportation capacity doubled instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that their sea transport fleet has also greatly improved in terms of sailing speed and storm resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Light magic crossbows are also becoming popular. Maybe in another hundred or eighty years, mass production will be possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These new technologies were not owned by the Alpha Kingdom before, and they began to be popularized on a large scale after they entered the grassland to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either it was a new gadget born under the stimulation of the war; or it was given by the big forces in the Southern Continent. Their purpose may be to clear the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the various ethnic groups in the mainland are not united. All of them are clamoring loudly, but none of them have taken practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if the human race gave them the promise, or they are afraid of the human race's strength, and they dare not stand up at this time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Emperor Yingren glanced at Alex. The matter of the port is the masterpiece of the old Beamon Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for that egomaniac who foolishly believed in the foolishness of the human race and opened up a route in order to reap huge profits from maritime trade, they would never have lost so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the commentary of everyone's eyes, Alex, who originally wanted to reduce the sense of presence as much as possible, bit the bullet and said: \"The matter has come to this point, we can only take the last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First release the plague—the plague of black evil spirits, forcing the human army to retreat. If they hold on to us, it will open the gates of hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't let us live, it won't make them easy. It's dead anyway, so pull the Human Race Alliance down to back it up! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All available means have been exhausted.

After earning a fortune, he was busy counting gold coins, and he received a blow to the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human masters who came to the door immediately started to do it without saying a word. If it wasn't for the fact that the other party wanted to capture him alive, he might already be a dragon corpse now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the advantage of speed, Maxim broke out of the encirclement of the human masters, and Maxim opened the way to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how fast he runs and how hidden he hides, after a while, he will be found by human masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, are you sure that the red dragon is settled in this kind of hill?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragons are all arrogant masters, and they have unusually high requirements for shelter. This kind of small hill obviously doesn't fit the identity of a giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Morrison, this is the Ula Mountains, and the top mountains are all occupied by powerful monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Red Dragon has already suffered serious injuries under the pursuit of the alliance masters. What he needs most now is to buy time to recover from his injuries, and he has no intention of fighting with the local monsters at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson explained patiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know much about the sky knight in front of him, only that he is a strong man of the royal family, and his seniority is surprisingly high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the twilight breath on his body, it can be seen that this person's lifespan is coming to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since this is the case, everyone will split up and set up a magic circle nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Red Dragon can escape the pursuit of alliance masters, and his strength must not be underestimated. Once he is allowed to escape, it will be difficult to catch him alive! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison immediately gave instructions to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not dissatisfied with this scene of ultra vires. They are all working for themselves, so there is no need to worry about these small problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another magic circles were set up, and the elemental fluctuations emerged, which quickly attracted the attention of the red dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been hunted down for so long, Maxim, who had long been frightened, immediately leaned out of the cave to check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Despicable reptiles, you are damned!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by a roar, a mouthful of magma sprayed out directly, frightening all the magicians to run away in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone join hands to take him down!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was issued, and Hudson hurriedly retreated to the rear. Fighting at this level is not something a rookie like him can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the dragon is injured, it is still a dragon. No matter how one's strength is weakened, he is still a well-deserved strongman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to Hudson, the weakest in the army who came this time were the earth knights, the magisters, and even two sky knights and a great magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many powerful people shot together, the effect is naturally extraordinary. The shock wave caused by the energy collision is like a tornado raging in the mountains and forests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A special long spear flew out, directly hit Maxim's tail, and violently rubbed against the scales, bursting out bursts of tearing sounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"ah!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn reptiles, you dare to hide the dragon-slaying gun privately! You just wait, my dragon clan will definitely not let it go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Maxim, who had suffered a great loss, turned and left, trying to break through the encirclement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, stop him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hurriedly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dragon-slaying gun is one of the special products made by various races in the mainland in order to fight against the dragon in ancient times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at Maxim being shot, it seems that only a scale is broken, nothing serious, it's a miss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The body of the giant dragon, the defense capabilities of different parts also have strengths and weaknesses. If it hits a weak area, it is not impossible to penetrate directly with a single shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Slaying Spear is not a panacea. It is very difficult to hit the dragon, let alone accurately hit the weak part of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering from the loss of the dragon slaying weapon, the giant dragon clan used thunderous means and powerful strength to force the mainland to destroy all the dragon slaying equipment, and the dragon slaying gun became a legend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the implementation of this destruction is still compromised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the human race, who is the overlord of the mainland, has a lot of dragon-slaying equipment hidden in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps these weapons can only lie in the warehouse and eat ashes in normal times; but at critical moments, they can play an important role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This dragon-slaying gun, which is similar to an artifact, was specially applied to the kingdom by Hudson after the warehouse burning case broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One dragon and one bear, a savage collision broke out in the sky. The red dragon, whose strength was greatly reduced, suffered a big loss in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn Earth Bear, I want to kill you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the roar, Maxim, who was already full of anger, became even more angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He yelled fiercely, but his body couldn't help changing the direction of his advance, trying to bypass Bear Stearns' interception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short delay, a group of powerful clansmen had already rushed forward. Facing the siege of many masters, Red Dragon suffered more and more injuries, and his resistance became weaker and weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Use Drunken Dragon Incense!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Morrison's words fell to the ground, everyone took out the vials they carried with them and greeted the Red Dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drunken Dragon Fragrance is also one of the means to target the dragon clan. Under normal circumstances, the amount of Drunken Dragon Incense needed to stun a giant dragon is huge, and often the dragon is stunned before it is stunned, and it is the first step to pass through the gang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is special. The red dragon has long been wounded. At this moment, he has half his life left, and his resistance has been greatly weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After struggling a few times, the red dragon finally couldn't bear the sleepiness and fell asleep directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for any pause, the magicians got busy again, constantly drawing the sealing magic circle on Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long was caught, but facing the huge monster in front of them, everyone suddenly had a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carrying a giant dragon back, I feel exciting just thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, this is the Ula Mountains. There are many high-level monsters along the way, so it is not appropriate to delay too long. This time, I can only trouble Mr. Bear Stearns.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worried that Warcraft is fake, what he is really worried about is the coming alliance masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it gets hit head-on, this operation will be in vain. Once the red dragon falls into the hands of the alliance, the confession is that the other party has the final say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a small matter to betray the nobles of the Northland. I am afraid that someone will deliberately expand it and implicate many nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, bring this stupid dragon back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Hudson's voice fell to the ground, a weird scene happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One person, one bear and one giant dragon, galloping out in the air. Soon, the group of military masters who came with them were left far behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of habit, the dragon was still swaying back and forth constantly, as if it was running wildly in the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Flying bear in the air, it seems that Earl Hudson's bear is not simple!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's hurry up and catch up. The Drunken Dragon Fragrance won't trap the Red Dragon for long, and if he wakes up in the barracks, it will be a big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighed, Morrison gave instructions to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a few hours after everyone left, the experts of the Terran Alliance also arrived at the scene. Looking at the plowed battlefield, everyone's faces were gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We kept this operation strictly confidential, and even the frontline generals didn't notify us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, someone is still eyeing the red dragon with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation on the battlefield, the Red Dragon should have been killed or captured by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in continuing to keep it secret. Immediately notify the coalition forces, and use their strength to find out as soon as possible which force the Red Dragon has fallen into! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man in purple said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the investigation team, instead of going to the logistics department to investigate step by step, he ran over to catch the dragon instead, which was out of order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being busy for so long, I finally made a wedding dress for someone else, and I can imagine the depression in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Jerome, this matter doesn't need to be investigated, it can be deduced. Now the only ones who are anxious to find the red dragon to seal it up are us and the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to waste time, just go and ask them for someone. They are carrying giant dragons, and they can't move much faster. Maybe we can reach the camp first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Kaveh said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his expression that he doesn't think it's a big deal to watch the excitement, it can be seen that he wants to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Kavehe, you can't say that. The Alpha Kingdom's performance in this war is still very good. Even if there are people who are greedy for ink and sell military supplies, it is only a small number of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the matter is investigated clearly, we don't need to rush to convict them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's wait and see, they have to give the alliance an explanation about the fire dragon burning warehouse case! When the results come out, decide what to do next. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jerome said insinuatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suppressing the Alpha Kingdom stems from interests, but it doesn't mean that he is willing to offend people to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Frank and the Kingdom of Alpha are one south and one north. Competition exists, but it has not yet reached the point of incompatibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In many places, there is also cooperation between the two countries. It is better to leave this kind of hatred to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Holy See and the Alpha Kingdom have fallen out a long time ago. Don't worry about Bishop Kavehe's refusal to work **** this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I hope so!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Kaveh said without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the big camp, Hudson, who returned first, was worrying about the sleeping red dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With its huge size, it is not easy to find a cage for him. An ordinary prison cell can't trap a giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another, special iron chains are constantly winding around the red dragon, and Hudson doesn't think it's enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, after I wake up this stupid dragon, you have to watch carefully and don't let him mess up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He couldn't help being careless. Close contact with the giant dragon, but it involves the matter of wealth and life, and the meeting can be dismissed if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Hudson! I'll watch him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sealing magic circle on this stupid dragon is not so easy to break free, and now it is impossible to release the dragon language magic at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, he is still injured, and his body is in the weakest state. Now he is still bound by so many iron chains, so there is no trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the guarantee from Bear Stearns, Hudson slowly took out the antidote for Drunken Dragon Fragrance. A pungent and disgusting smell instantly permeated the audience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One person and one bear, who had been prepared for a long time, held their breath early, leaving the red dragon to enjoy this unique flavor alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It stinks, it stinks! Damn the earth bear, **** human reptile, what is this, you are disgusting, Mr. Dragon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Maxim waking up, the special iron chain wrapped around his body was rattling, as if it might break free at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the prison escape operation has just begun, and Bear Stearns' gravity field greeted it, and pressed the struggling red dragon heavily to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Assholes! You are all assholes!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Earth Bear, to actually mix with humans is simply disgrace to the Earth Bear family!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the constantly clamoring red dragon, Bear Stearns slapped it, and then said with a smile: \"Ignorant stupid dragon, you are jealous of Lord Bear Stearns' life!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really a waste of such a big guy, it's actually a parallel dragon. I'm curious now, is there something wrong with your development, or is it a new hybrid made by the Dragon Clan? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to hurting people, Bear Stearns has reached the pinnacle, and Hudson who is watching is stunned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When did my own bear become so rascal. Feeling that his usual education to the cubs is now all in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are the bastard! Your whole family is bastard...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the word \"kind\" was uttered, the huge bear's paw slapped it again, directly slapping Maxim's eyes with golden stars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the beating was almost done, Hudson knew it was time to play by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, I solemnly remind you now that your situation is very dangerous, please remain rational enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If our next conversation does not go well, your dragon scales will become our armor, your dragon blood will become our cultivation resources, your dragon claws will be processed into weapons, and your dragon skin will become our armor. Carrier of magic scrolls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even your keel will be handed over to the Necromancer and made into a Necromancer Dragon. Of course, your soul is indispensable here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giant dragons are a rare commodity. Alchemists, arcanists, and magicians all over the continent are looking forward to it, and they are waiting for you to contribute to their research! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Hudson's threat, Maxim asked in disbelief: \"You dare to slay a dragon, aren't you afraid of the revenge of my dragon clan?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, it seems that you haven't figured out the situation. Under normal circumstances, everyone naturally wants to give the dragon family a face and will not take the initiative to slay the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time the situation is special, you caused it. They attacked the logistics of the Terran coalition army for no reason and set fire to our warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Dragon Clan needs face, and our Human Clan also needs face. Don't forget that the current Aslante continent is the era of my human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the Dragon Clan is certainly strong, but your number is really too rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think the dragon clan will go to war with the human race just because of you, a troublesome dragon. If there was a fight, it would not be a dragon that fell, but hundreds of dragons blood-stained the earth. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said flicking to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current him cannot represent the entire human race. Facing the entire human race, the dragon clan needs to be reasonable; but facing him, a human nobleman, the dragon clan is not so easy to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Maxim knew nothing about all this. What he knows is that Hudson has a high status among the human race, can command a group of masters, and has an earth bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Human, what do you want to ask. As long as it can be said, I can tell you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon was under the chain and had to bow his head. As a young dragon, Maxim hadn't lived enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, I think you have got the key to the problem wrong. Actually, I don't want to ask anything. I may know the ins and outs of the fire dragon burning warehouse case better than you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a contract, as long as you sign your real name on it, you can regain your freedom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you offend the Human Race Alliance, I will take care of the aftermath for you. Guarantee that no one will use this as an excuse to come over to slaughter the dragon! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson handed over the self-made contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Impossible, you let the great red dragon work for you, this is simply insulting...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the red dragon could finish roaring, Hudson interrupted: \"Mr. Maxim, I reminded you to be rational enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you are left with two choices. Either choose to sign a contract and continue to soar in the sky; or become a bone dragon, and your soul will fall into the abyss, and you will never be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest you sign a contract. Although it is not a complete equal contract, it also protects your dragon birth rights and property rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the long lifespan of the dragon race, the lifespan of our human beings is nothing more than the time for you to sleep in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only a hundred years, and then you will be a free dragon again. Throughout the history of the dragon clan, there are not a few giant dragons who have signed contracts with our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you sign a contract, then it is the fourth giant dragon that has signed a contract with humans on the mainland today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They're not ashamed, so why should you care?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In such a short period of time, no news could reach Long Island. You can also hide names if you're really embarrassed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the words fell, the red dragon stared at Hudson, as if he wanted to tear him to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this situation didn't last long before it was changed by a \"pop\". Under the vigorous whipping of the bear's paw, Maxim's faucet became fatter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn Earth Bear, don't bully the dragon too much! Humans, don't you care about him?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Red Dragon's complaint, Hudson smiled lightly and said, \"He is my bear, and you are just a wild dragon, so who do I support?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All right, Mr. Maxim. Since you are not willing to sign a contract, then I will not force you to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoy the last time of the dragon life to the fullest, the dragon will start to be scraped later. First remove the dragon scales, then release the dragon blood, and then cut off the dragon meat...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the powerful vitality of the Dragon Clan, Your Excellency should be able to witness how he died with his own eyes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson turned and left without any intention of staying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, fear overwhelmed the proud red dragon, and shouted tremblingly: \"Wait!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, a real name directly landed on the contract. One person and one dragon, who were originally irrelevant, were instantly linked together by the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson couldn't bear the joy in his heart anymore, and a smile appeared directly from the corner of his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of people who have been recruited recently, readers, strengthen your protection!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Haiyue had a cold and fever at the beginning, but after several trials and tribulations, she finally became positive again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meiyang tries to go to the hospital as little as possible, the hospital is now the most dangerous area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The red dragon was sent back to the barracks, and shortly after it was bound with iron chains, the red dragon woke up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson personally went to check the situation, and the Red Dragon took the initiative to conclude a contract with him. He became his own dragon, so His Excellency the Earl ordered to release the red dragon to go back to recuperate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the noble officer are obviously a message Hudson deliberately released to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is his camp, without the nod of his commander, the face of a priest is not enough to make the noble officers under his command say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, Morrison was choked to death. The famous scene in the legend actually happened in front of my eyes. This kind of psychological gap is unbearable for normal people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't want to believe all of this, the facts were in front of him, so he couldn't help but not believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminiscent of the classic story of Hudson picking up bears on the way, it seems that reaping a giant dragon can also be justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of unstoppable luck, if it is said that there is no divine favor, he would not believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, report the news to the little guy Affiero, let him come and deal with it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison said tiredly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Children and grandchildren have their own blessings. As an old antique of the royal family, he is over 170 years old. No matter how well maintained he is, he will not live for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you worry about these things again, the time to die will only be faster. Sky Knight is not Chinese cabbage, the royal family still needs to exist to support it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice fell to the ground, and a familiar voice came from behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old Ancestor, I already know. It's just that this matter is difficult to handle. The addition of an extra dragon will indeed improve the strength of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this red dragon attacked the barracks before and set fire to a large number of material warehouses. The alliance investigation team will definitely suspect that we are deliberately acting! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good thing for the kingdom to increase its strength, but he would rather not have this way of improvement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson's reputation in the country was soaring very quickly. He was completely invincible among his peers, and he couldn't find anyone who wanted to support him in the ring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Koslow family is weak and can be suppressed, but what about after 30 to 50 years?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, Hudson will still be at his peak, and the older generation in the kingdom will almost recede. He is simply a \"power minister\" chosen by heaven.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even more detrimental was the quasi-power minister, who was particularly lucky. Although I haven't heard of going out to pick up gold coins, but people can pick up monsters!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First the Earth Bear and now the Dragon. If he had nothing to do and went to the Warcraft Mountains every now and then, he didn't know how much he would gain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the trouble with the alliance investigation team, it is purely an excuse. Originally, the other party came here to find fault, and they would find an entry point after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless all the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom are willing to abandon the orc prairie and not extend their tentacles here, they are destined to be in constant trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Ai Fierro! These little problems, you can just worry about it yourself, don't bring me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the dragon has been captured, and the task of the enshrining group is completed. You can figure out the rest by yourself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Morrison turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was too stimulated today, he needs to go back and be quiet. This is not good when you are old, and you can't stand the stimulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, a wry smile appeared on the face of Grand Duke Efiero. If there is a good way, he doesn't have to worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To deal with the special existence of Hudson, the royal family must not only reuse it, but also restrict and suppress it. It is a balance to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the speed is the most difficult to control. A little carelessness can lead to catastrophe in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the handsome tent, Hudson and Archduke Effiero sat facing each other, drinking tea leisurely as if they were close friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Congratulations to Earl Hudson, becoming the fourth dragon knight on the mainland! This is the glory of our Alpha Kingdom, and His Majesty will be very happy when he knows.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the words of Grand Duke Affiero, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly, and Caesar III could be happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he appeared too quickly, which was enough to be feared, but now that he appeared again, the danger level must have risen in a straight line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all luck! Maybe it was the previous battle that broke the Red Dragon's brain. As soon as I went to investigate, he cried and shouted to sign a contract with me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't explain it. As soon as this explanation came out, Grand Duke Affiero became more and more depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Red Dragon is really brain-destroyed and has the problem of signing contracts with people, the royal family will really suffer a lot in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is just thinking about it. Although there are many wonderful histories of the Dragon Clan, it has never happened that after being brain-destroyed, they took the initiative to pull people to sign a contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Earl is still the most charming, if someone else goes there, maybe it will be a different ending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the red dragon has become our dragon, and the alliance investigation team may not be able to explain it. This time they are coming in a bad way, Your Excellency the Earl must be prepared to deal with it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Affiero changed the subject.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be reminding Hudson to be prepared, but in fact it is telling him that since the red dragon has been turned into a mount, he has to make good for the disasters caused by the red dragon before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the Grand Duke, the alliance investigation team came this time, mainly to track down the reselling of military supplies. The previous fire dragon burning warehouse case was just a small case caught in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics department has already investigated this series of cases. It just involves the face of the kingdom, so far I haven't figured out how to deal with it next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are left with two choices:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either do the fire dragon burning warehouse case, admit that the defenders were dereliction of duty, and erase the matter of reselling military supplies. The kingdom will pay for the loss of the alliance, and finally the nobles who resell the military supplies will pay for the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or the logistics department will directly hand over the evidence in its hands to the alliance investigation team. Among them, there are not only the reselling of military supplies, but also the criminal evidence that someone funded and invited Red Dragon to burn down the empty warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency the Grand Duke, you are also one of the witnesses. Judging from the situation at the scene that day, there was not a grain of food or a handful of weapons wreckage in the ruins of the destroyed warehouse...even the dust on the ground was pitifully small! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson unceremoniously used the method of dumping the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be taken advantage of. The goal of the alliance investigation team is the Alpha Kingdom, not the Red Dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the case of reselling military supplies is settled, the Alliance has no reason to hold on to the Red Dragon. Rules are only used to restrain people, not dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the evidence is thrown out, the alliance investigation team will have no time to waste time on the red dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Dragon Clan still has some cards on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they are really in a hurry, no great noble is willing to take the risk of being retaliated against and slay the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Hudson said before to fool the Red Dragon was pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slaying a dragon secretly, maybe everyone dares to do it, killing a giant dragon openly, everyone will worry about being retaliated by the dragon clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tiger skin of the Terran Alliance, just show it and brag about it. The power of the giant dragon is not only reflected in the combat effectiveness of a single player, but the high mobility of others is the most powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of giant dragons form a group, catch a family force to output fiercely, and wait for the reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance to rush over to help collect the corpses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it doesn't go too far and just retaliates against the forces involved, it will be difficult for the divided human race to muster up the courage to start a full-scale war with the dragon race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ball was kicked to his side, and the smiling face of Grand Duke Efiero collapsed. I've heard of Hudson's difficulty for a long time, but I didn't expect that things are really tight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that two choices are given, but in fact, two holes are dug in the front and back, and you have to jump into the hole when you advance or retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal processing, face is saved. But the Human Race Alliance will definitely not sell it. There is a high probability that the Alpha Kingdom will be forced to make major concessions before they will be let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly handing over the evidence of reselling military supplies to the alliance investigation team is undoubtedly breaking the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was the face of the kingdom trampled on the ground, but it also aroused strong dissatisfaction among the nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"May I ask Earl Hudson, how many military supplies have been resold by those guys in the Northland?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not terrible to have problems, but it is terrible to not solve the problems. If the hole left is small, everyone can work hard to fill it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Grand Duke, I am afraid that only they themselves know how many military supplies they have resold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But here I have a partial list of their reselling military supplies. These incomplete statistics alone, if calculated according to the current market price, the total value will not be less than 10 million gold coins. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson deliberately changed the concept and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the banker of the black market, it is not 100% clear who resold the materials and how many materials were resold, but the statistics generally do not have too much error.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ten million gold coins sounds scary, that's because the current transaction price in the market was originally speculated by the investigation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you put it another way, the amount of profit from reselling military supplies, the figure has shrunk to between 1.5 million and 1.8 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Split into five major families, each with more than 300,000 gold coins. In just a few months, so much money has been made, which is really too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the money was not swallowed by a certain duke alone. The younger brothers below are also sharing the benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The darkest noble in the north has only such a big appetite. Generally speaking, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom still have some integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone did extend their hands to the logistics supplies of the coalition forces, but at least the bottom line is still sticking to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this were not the case, everyone would not be able to make up for the gap in time after receiving the news of the investigation team's arrival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the North took the risk. On the one hand, they really didn't have so many supplies on the front line, so they could fill the gap for everyone; on the other hand, their holes were too big. .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring the details and being confused by the figure of 10 million gold coins, Grand Duke Afiero said slowly after contemplating for a while:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, this is a big matter, and I can't make up my mind for a while. Why don't we hold a meeting of the logistics department first and let everyone discuss and decide?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should have been reported to the king, but as a good courtier, Grand Duke Afiero was obviously unwilling to throw this hot potato to Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is destined to offend the nobles of the Northland to death, and it is better for the coach Hudson to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, he suddenly found that it wasn't that bad that Hudson got the red dragon mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this giant dragon, I guess the young commander in front of me would keep pretending to be confused, and it would be impossible to directly turn against the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, I have to admit that the knife that Hudson is handing out now is accurate to the right time, place and people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If earlier, when everyone had a pile of holes, whoever came out to expose the reselling of military supplies would be our enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is obviously different. Except for the guys from the Northland, the other nobles in the kingdom have almost filled their pits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the most unpleasant time for everyone to see the nobles of the Northland. Why do they have to cut meat to make up for the deficit, with the exception of the northern nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing a rogue is fine, at least you have to be smarter. Now that you have been caught, you have to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, it was the northern nobles who caused this disaster. Even if Geoff disappeared, it wouldn't change the fact that he came from the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that in order to rob the nobles of the Northland, there are already many people offended in the kingdom, and a large group of nobles want to add insult to injury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But their most important enemy is King Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Excellency, the logistics department has already made a conclusion on this matter. In the last logistics meeting, we set the tone: if it can be handled internally, we will handle it internally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relevant evidence that the northern nobles resold military supplies, bought red dragons and set fire to empty warehouses were all in this box.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, some time ago, several dukes of the North had secretly contacted people from the Holy See. It is not known exactly what was discussed, but soon the assassination case broke out in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a guess. It can't be used as evidence, Grand Duke, don't take it to heart. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson took eye medicine unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the evidence to the ethnic alliance investigation team is just talking. Even if the meeting of the logistics department can pass, he can't do that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each circle has its own rules. Hudson is an aristocrat from the Alpha Kingdom, not a nobleman from the Human Race Alliance. When it comes to issues of principle, he must sit upright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid being tricked by others, he did not hesitate to set the tone as early as possible to deal with it internally. Perhaps it was this tone that prompted the northern nobles to take such risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, reselling military supplies is a thing of the past. Account books and warehouses were burned, and they had the final say on how much supplies were lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as one of his own people does not come forward to report, it will be extremely difficult for the investigation team to find evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that after the warehouse burning case broke out, they specially sent someone to notify Red Dragon to go overseas to avoid the limelight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Maxim is a cheating dragon. He promised to be good, but in fact he didn't take their warnings to heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of Red Dragon, even if he can't beat him, can he still not run?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One careless move, the whole game is lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't want to pay the bill himself, could only export to the nobles of the North. As for the problem of offending people, I can't care so much anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is the commander in chief of a frontal armed conflict. If the nobles of the Northland dare to do something, it is a rebellion, and they will surely kill themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to carry out the assassination, he has the Earth Bear and the Giant Dragon as bodyguards, and it is estimated that no assassin organization will accept such a death order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Earl of Hudson. I will truthfully report this matter to the king. If the alliance investigation team comes to inquire, please find a way to delay the time first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountering a watertight opponent, the plan to let Hudson pull the hatred alone was shattered before it had time to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this incident, if it is said that this action against the nobles of the North was not the conspiracy of Hudson and the king, I am afraid no one will believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the war was over, the nobles of the Northern Lands would not be able to reach out so far even if they wanted to retaliate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This account is likely to be charged to the king. After all, after recovering several provinces in northern Xinjiang, the royal leaders are about to encircle the fiefdoms of the five major families in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of area, one family is better than five. Once developed, the power of the royal family will surely reach a new height.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it could rely on the northward expansion to break this passive situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the reselling of military supplies happened, the ready-made handle was sent to the king. If Caesar III didn't ruthlessly cut them, they were all blessed by the Lord of Dawn, and he wanted to get a new fief. Go ahead and dream!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to make trouble. Except for themselves, all the nobles in the kingdom hope that there will be one less cake. On this issue, everyone will stand with the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the five major families in the Northland who were reduced to sandwich biscuits were sitting still waiting to die, one can imagine how hard the future would be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't really forced to, the northern nobles would not have played a disgraceful role in the previous assassination case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that they are too jealous of Caesar III and want to change to a foolish king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Grand Duke, I will try my best to delay the time. But after all, the investigation team represents the Human Race Alliance. They want to intervene in the investigation, and I can't bear the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Over there in the capital, you better remind me. Otherwise, if the investigation team finds out something, it will be a big trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said it was troublesome, but deep down he had a completely different idea. Trouble is a good thing, no trouble is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have harvested a giant dragon. If there is no big news to divert attention and cause hatred, how can I calm down everyone's jealousy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't take the initiative to report to the alliance investigation team, but it doesn't mean that I can't secretly guide the investigation team to investigate the case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bulk material transactions, no matter how cleanly they are done, will inevitably leave loopholes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many people involved in the transaction, the personnel in charge of escorting the supplies, and the witnesses along the way, who can guarantee that no one will say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the material gap can be filled in time, the remarks of these people are just talking nonsense and not credible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't close the gap, these people are the breakthrough in the case of reselling military supplies. Once the hole is opened, it will be easy to check the following things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Empty warehouses that were destroyed, account books without protection and backup, all of these are loopholes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you go deep into the barracks of the nobles in the North to investigate, you don't have to worry about finding evidence. Even if the investigation team is not strong enough, they will still receive video data before and after the warehouse was burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the contract with the Red Dragon was signed, Hudson threw out some evidence about the reselling of military supplies by the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many nobles, and there are everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, a certain noble officer likes to write a diary to record important events that happen every day; it is also very reasonable for a certain nobleman to like to use a photo stone to record the major events around him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things, or not to do; once done, it must be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern nobles are deeply entrenched, and have the power to overturn the table in the kingdom. The strength within the kingdom alone may not be able to do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to hurt them, you have to use external force. If the Terran Alliance wants to kick the Alpha Kingdom out of the dining table, it must do a solid military reselling case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Human Race Alliance came forward and insisted on swearing at it, and there was no way to explain how many nobles in the Northland would die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this reason, Hudson did not hesitate to take the title of Marshal of the Kingdom that he has not yet obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's just that the situation is a bit different from what he expected, and it can even be said to have nothing to do with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reselling military supplies and hiring dragons to burn warehouses are all serious crimes. But if you want to deal with it in this way, it also depends on when it happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the threat of orcs is gradually eliminated, all the nobles in the kingdom are gearing up, hoping to make a big profit from the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a major case breaks out at this time, the forces in the Terran Alliance who want to suppress the Alpha Kingdom will definitely take the opportunity to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cut off the things that the nobles in the country think about, even if Caesar III is the king, he would not dare to do such immoral things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cover the lid, conduct a low-key process internally, and deal with the aftermath of the guys in the Northland, Caesar III is not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, his dissatisfaction with Hudson also reached a critical point. As a front-line coach, he is unwilling to even take the blame for the boss, and his loyalty is obviously questionable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the old marshal was here, this kind of thing would never bother him. He would only let the members of the alliance investigation team find evidence because of various accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of the aristocrats, in many cases, things can only be used when things become big and public anger is caused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when it comes to local powerful factions like the northern nobles, it is difficult to shake their foundation in general political struggles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Absurd!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What absurdity!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a disgrace to the kingdom to dare to do such a thing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all have a look, the kingdom has scum. Some people ignore the interests of the human race and regard the interests of the kingdom in order to seek personal gain...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Caesar III had already thrown the investigation report in his hand to the officials in the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the height of the topic, it can be seen that this is going to be dealt with strictly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunity is rare, and it is hard to catch a deadly scandal among the nobles of the North. If you don't take the opportunity to slash them, it will be hard to get rid of the hatred in your heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, all the ministers who circulated the investigation report turned gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the spokesperson of the northern nobles in the court, the face at this moment is like a dead parent. He wanted to intercede, but he didn't dare to touch the king at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not a secret that the nobles of the Northland resold military supplies, but now that the investigation team has verified it, the nature has completely changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, there are many nobles who resell military supplies, but before the arrival of the investigation team of the Human Race Alliance, everyone made up the gap by cutting meat, except for the nobles in the Northland who were dishonest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did not make up for the shortfall, but instead hired a dragon to burn the warehouse. This kind of behavior of putting the kingdom in an embarrassing situation for selfishness is undoubtedly harming the interests of many nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this matter must be severely punished, so as to serve as an example to others!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just considering the subsequent impact, the inside story of this case is not suitable for disclosure. It is better to punish the crime strictly because of the ineffectiveness of guarding the food and grass. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III was very dissatisfied with the tentative intercession of the minister of state affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strict punishment for the open-mouthed and closed-mouthed crimes, but when it comes to the specific charges, it is obvious that the thunder is loud and the rain is little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Insufficient food and grass guards\" is a problem of ability and luck. Responsible for transporting military supplies for a long time, no one can guarantee that there will never be accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with this kind of crime, no matter how serious it is, is harmless to the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Too light! The alliance is still watching, even if the kingdom covered up the reselling of military supplies for them, a charge of dereliction of duty is still indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, now that there is such a big hole, where should it be filled next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom can't be allowed to pay for the aftermath of a bunch of sinners who resold military supplies, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado mocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not aimless, and military supplies are not unlimited. At present, the main body providing military supplies for the army has gradually changed from the original Alpha Kingdom to the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the alliance's reward order was issued, the expenses of the Terran Alliance increased day by day. In order to raise military expenses, the Union Parliament raised funds three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now countless pairs of eyes are staring at it. If the hole is not filled, the investigation team will never let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are real interests involved, and those who originally wanted to plead for love have chosen to shut up at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a sensible person, and the evidence has been found. The loss must be borne by the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Punishment only for \"negligence of duty\" is considered a lenient sentence. If it is really treated as reselling military supplies, the nature is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the positions of the ministers gradually tended to be unified, Caesar III secretly sighed. Obviously, everyone does not support beating the northern nobles to death with a single stick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the aristocrats in the Northland are very popular. The main reason is that everyone is a member of the aristocratic group and must protect the interests of the aristocratic class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the crime of reselling military supplies is serious, it has not violated everyone's bottom line. Naturally, the principle of \"nobility should be punished lightly\" should be followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Caesar III slapped the table and said: \"Tell those shameless guys that you are responsible for plugging the gap and dealing with the aftermath of what you have done!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This case has seriously damaged the interests of the kingdom. Although we are helping to cover it up now, it is for the sake of fairness. All persons involved in the case are not allowed to participate in the division of interests after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send a question to Earl Hudson and ask him how he became the coach? Why didn't he even know that his subordinates were so greedy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately notified the result of the handling to the alliance to calm down the turmoil as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to kill the nobles of the Northland with a single stick, but it is very necessary to limit their strength development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the king, without the threat of orcs, the military strength of the northern nobles has lost their value, and only \"threats\" remain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is to make the nobles of the Northland pay losses, or deprive them of the right to distribute their post-war benefits, it is essentially for weakening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received the inquiry document from the kingdom, Hudson glanced at it and threw it aside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a coach who is determined to do badly, it doesn't matter whether this kind of nutritious official document is read or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he is busy negotiating with the members of the Alliance Investigation Team. More and more evidence fell into the hands of the investigation team, and the results announced by the kingdom naturally did not satisfy the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, let's call out the dragon! There are some things that need to be clarified in person.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jerome said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the conflict between Hudson and the Northland nobles is no secret to the investigation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of everyone, if Hudson does not make trouble at this time, it is regarded as taking into account the interests of the kingdom. It is certainly impossible to run against the investigation team for the sake of enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the scene in front of him, Grand Duke Efiero also saw it and was anxious. Facing the pressure from the league, he is very aware of the pressure Hudson is under at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marquis, Red Dragon is recovering from his injuries at the moment, so it is inappropriate to go over and disturb him now. If you want to see him, you might as well wait a little longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investigation team came here this time, the main task is to investigate the reselling of military supplies, and it is impossible for Red Dragon to participate in the reselling of military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The granary was set on fire and burned down, and it was also because of the hatred and anger between a certain nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dragon race is different from my human race, and cannot use the same standard for requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, someone is responsible for paying for the lost food and supplies, which can guarantee the smooth logistics of the army, so why bother to get into it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also drunk. Obviously he was the one who wanted to bully the nobles of the North, but now he has become the biggest defender of the nobles of the North, at least on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, if you want to talk about reselling military supplies, you have been reported under your real name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is evidence that during your tenure as the head of the logistics of the coalition forces, the frequency of vehicles and personnel entering and leaving the warehouse was far higher than normal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sir, should I explain? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Kaveh asked with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the object of the report, Hudson is naturally the key monitoring object of the investigation team. It is a pity that after searching and searching, in the end, no substantive problems were found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what explanation do you want?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The frequency of material deployment is never determined by personal will. The battlefield is ever-changing, and the logistics department must naturally follow the footsteps of the frontline troops when deploying supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have the ability to predict the future, so I will allocate logistics materials in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have heard about the great prophecy of the Holy See for a long time, which can predict the prophets. If Your Excellency the Bishop can practice to the great success, it may be possible to do this. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson responded calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interpretation is non-existent. There is a problem in the first place, and the more you explain it, the worse it will only become.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle of nonsense, Hudson decisively chose to make a joke of \"big prophecy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the name sounds like it can \"predict the past and the future\", in fact this magic is mainly used for fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention predicting the future, even if you want to peek into the past, you need to pay a painful price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Bishop Kavehe rolled his eyes and said: \"Earl Hudson, the great prophecy is naturally amazing, if you want to see it, you can go to the Holy Mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we have found evidence of someone reselling military supplies, and we need your cooperation. Please hand over all the accounts for inspection by the investigation team! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem. The items in the logistics department are all ready and can be checked at any time. If you can help find out the moths, I will be grateful from the logistics department.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the truth. After laying out the game for so long, it was finally time to harvest. Someone came to help with a sickle, and it was hard not to be grateful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the accounts prepared in advance, there is also a lot of black material that can prove that the nobles of the Northland resold military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the numbers in the warehouse, you can tell that the granary supplies they received were so much \"100 million\", which far exceeded the actual needs of the frontline troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the investigation team gets the list of materials received from the frontline troops, the problem can be found by comparing the before and after.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar problematic projects in the logistics department. It's just that other nobles have already plugged the gap. Even if the supplies are over-collected, they are still stored in the warehouses of the transfer stations in various places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the physical objects and the list of accounts can be matched, the excess is a question of whether the deployment of the logistics department is reasonable, not reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, let's investigate first! But from now on, we must supervise the suspects involved in the case to avoid collusion and running away. I hope the Earl can understand!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jerome said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Marquis, we will fully cooperate with the investigation. However, if the investigation team wants to arrest someone, they must first produce evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, before taking special measures against noble officers, we must first notify our logistics department, so as not to affect the smooth logistics of the coalition forces. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Hudson's voice fell, Grand Duke Afiero's expression changed drastically. Compared with the toughness just now, it is obvious that he has chosen to compromise now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating again and again, he finally chose to shut up. Hudson couldn't stand the pressure of the investigation team, so why couldn't he?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Archduke Ai Fierro needs to consider more issues. Handing over the leadership of the investigation so quickly, the nobles of the Northland must have no time to deal with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a major problem is discovered and the alliance uses this as an excuse to deprive the kingdom of the qualification to participate in the distribution of spoils, the nobles in the country will definitely not let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to angering the nobles of the Northland, everyone also has to investigate who is the second or fifth child, and even the interests of the kingdom's noble group are ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion. Grand Duke Effiero always suspects that the alliance investigation team can find the problem so quickly, and it is inseparable from Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just doesn't make sense logically. Once the northern nobles were convicted of reselling military supplies, Hudson would be the fish in the pond that was affected by the fire at the city gate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reputation, power, and distribution of benefits after the war will all be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson had a **** feud with the nobles of the North, it was only one of them. At his age, he had plenty of time for revenge, and he didn't have to kill a thousand enemies and lose eight hundred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After counting them carefully, Grand Duke Efiero completely put down the idea of ​​finding out who was behind the scenes. The number of enemies of the nobles in the North is really too many, and what he knows alone exceeds three digits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few of these people who have entered the army, and some of them even have a high status in the army. If you are deliberately staring at the nobles of the Northland, it is not surprising to catch some black materials about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the evidence in the hands of the alliance investigation team is still slightly insufficient. It is only enough to testify that some of the nobles in the North were reselling military supplies, but it is not enough to make things big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the alliance wants to investigate is not an individual, but a criminal gang, a \"criminal gang\" that can implicate the entire Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this goes on, the biggest trouble will be King Caesar III besides the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First reported it to the Alliance Council unreasonably, and then came to stab the knife secretly by his own people. Thinking from the gloomy perspective of whoever benefits, whoever is the black hand, the suspicion of the royal family's single-handed leadership is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The urgent battle report from the front line put an end to this disharmonious conversation, and all eyes were on Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is an ultimatum from the orcs. They have already started to release the plague. If we don't want to die, we should withdraw our troops quickly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimated that all the troops on the front line had received warnings. The war to come is likely to become even more brutal. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without saying a word about withdrawing troops, Hudson is all too aware of human nature. At this moment, the coalition army is busy making a fortune, how could they be intimidated by a threatening letter from the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the plague did cause mass destruction to everyone, it would be very difficult for everyone to give up promotion and get rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this news, everyone's faces were extremely ugly. For the members of the investigation team, they came to investigate the case of reselling military supplies, not to prevent the plague.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 316": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 316: showdown time\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    As soon as he received the threatening letter, Hudson ordered the activation of the epidemic prevention plan, but unfortunately it was too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs didn't just warn, but actually released the plague. When the letter came, the plague had already spread among the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The complex personnel composition of the coalition forces directly made Hudson's epidemic prevention plan unsustainable. After all, he can only restrain the people in the logistics department, not the frontline army and the mixed mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this plague is accompanied by an incubation period. Before the virus broke out, there was no trace of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of non-combat attrition appeared, which soon attracted the attention of the high-level coalition forces. Even the investigation of corruption cases has become old news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The despicable orcs have released the plague, trying to force us to withdraw our troops with this dirty method. What do you think about this?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Sunil's question stunned Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expected criticism did not happen. Instead, he asked everyone for their opinions. Obviously, the desire to fight in the Frankish Kingdom is not as high as he imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to continue this war, just a plague is not enough to make the first kingdom of the mainland retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, most of the victims of the plague were ordinary soldiers with weak resistance. Even if aristocratic military officers who have succeeded in cultivation are hit, most of them can save their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priest's great purification technique also has a certain effect on the plague. The only problem is that the sequelae are so big, and the number of priests who can release the Great Purification Technique is too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After continuous research by the priests, it can basically be judged that this plague is the plague of black evil that has been rampant in the mainland for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the history of the human race, there is another name—the Black Death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lethality displayed so far is not as terrifying as in the legend, that is because it is still winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, we can barely control the plague, but once winter turns to spring, the situation will deteriorate sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war drags on until summer, the Black Death, which erupts in full force, will pose a fatal threat to most knights and magicians. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See has the deepest research on these strange viruses. It's just that these are usually regarded as taboo methods and cannot be used unless it is absolutely necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past history of the human race's infighting, everyone also maintained the most basic rationality, and never played such crazy methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy this time is obviously the Lord who doesn't play by the rules. The plague that killed people regardless of enemy or friend was released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the crowd's scolding and complaining, Hudson silently became a melon-eating crowd. It is understandable to take any means for the continuation of the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Understanding is meaningless. When it's time to make a move, Hudson will not be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you can't drag it on, let's make a quick decision!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the end of winter, try to cause as many casualties as possible to the orcs. By the time of spring, the orc empire may have collapsed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and it does not make much sense to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire, whose vitality has been severely damaged, will hardly return to the pre-war level even if it takes a hundred years of cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the loss of the fertile orc prairie and only a piece of barren rotten land, the development potential of the orc has been substantially weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one day all the orc races are unified, the Alpha Kingdom will no longer be the forefront of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's thinking, it is the best choice to pack up now and go back to each house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just out of the interests of the kingdom, he still has to work hard, and he can't let the war end so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The corruption case has not yet come to fruition. If the war ends now, all the pressure will be concentrated on the case itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach of the Alpha Kingdom's army, Hudson has to jump out and perform anyway at this time to prove that he has worked hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you are thinking too well. Affected by the plague, the movement speed of the army has been greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially your logistics department is extremely slow. If the fighting continues, I'm afraid the soldiers won't even be able to guarantee what their next meal will be! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Blake's merciless sarcasm, Hudson looked very ugly, but deep down he was extremely happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is right to be opposed, which is exactly what he wants to see. In this war, he had obtained everything he wanted, and there was no need to stay and waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, although Blake's words are harsh, they are not unreasonable. The current situation is indeed not suitable for the coalition forces to continue to deepen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plague has been released. According to the orcs, if the war continues, they will open a passage to **** and attract powerful people from different planes to descend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the continent in the last era, it is not surprising that the Orc Empire has several space portals in its hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they are allowed to open the channel, it will be a threat to all living beings on the entire continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed so far, the orc empire has been severely damaged, and can no longer threaten the hegemony of our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to accept it as soon as it's good, accept the mediation of various ethnic groups in the mainland, and consider other issues after digesting the orc prairie. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Olafur persuaded with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But behind this smile, there is an undeniable strand. The Kingdom of Franks, the Holy See, and the Kingdom of Iberia no longer want to fight, and other forces naturally know how to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the common will of everyone, Hudson will naturally not die. After the representatives of the forces in the coalition expressed their attitude, he went downhill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military meeting ended, and the pressure on the logistics department suddenly increased. The coalition forces were not prepared to continue the offensive, and their eyes were focused on logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first ones to bear the brunt are naturally a group of northern nobles who were deeply involved in the corruption case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deeper the investigation team investigates, the more evidence they find, and many small and medium-sized nobles were directly arrested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the panic, the five Dukes of the Northland were also trembling, fearing that they would get trapped in it anytime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The alliance investigation team has already started arresting people. We filed a complaint, but the headquarters did not respond. Obviously that **** Hudson is planning to betray us!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the alliance investigation team is, it must abide by the rules of the game. Without the acquiescence of the Alpha Kingdom, they have no right to directly arrest people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the current situation, it is obvious that the higher authorities have reached an agreement and deliberately let the alliance investigation team come to arrest people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the northern aristocratic group didn't try to resist, it's just that after the investigation team showed the evidence that the arrested people were reselling military supplies, everyone was discouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the five dukes, none of them dared to openly disagree with the alliance investigation team. There is no shadow of the intervention of the Kingdom, which has placed high hopes on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pias, calm down. Perhaps the key to this matter is no longer on the front line, but in the political game behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson is no fool. Even if you have a grudge against you, you will not retaliate in this way of giving someone a handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting what happened in the recent period, it is obviously aimed at our family. Such a generous layout was obviously not planned and implemented by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the ability to do so many things, how many other people in the kingdom can do it besides our good Majesty? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia asked solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evidence is not needed, just judging from the development of the situation, this is very similar to the handwriting of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the flaw is too obvious, and it can be associated with him after a little reasoning, lacking the necessary cover-up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, for a Yangmou, whether to expose himself or not doesn't seem to be that important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pit this time cannot be said to bury the nobles of the North in one fell swoop, at least it will make them unable to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As more and more people go to prison, there will always be someone who can't stand the pressure and finally betrays a few of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you get stuck in it, life and death are beyond your control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on their past style, at this time, if everyone doesn't make trouble, it's considered a face. It is almost impossible to expect the kingdom to do its best to save it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That can't sit still, according to the current investigation, it is only a matter of time before we are exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other words, some of us have been exposed, but the alliance investigation team is not in a hurry to take action against us out of political considerations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it won't last long. The battle on the front line has stopped, and now there is only a group of mercenaries left, still making their final efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire has nothing to worry about right now. The alliance's appetite is nothing more than the occupied prairie. The next truce negotiation process should be relatively smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the armistice treaty is signed, the coalition forces don't need to worry about logistical turmoil, and our family is really in danger! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The painstakingly planned \"fire dragon burning warehouse\" only delayed the progress of the investigation team, and did not erase all evidence as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the deepening of the investigation, more and more evidence against them. A large number of northern nobles went to prison for corruption, and Pias really panicked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Judging from the current situation, there is a high probability that we will not be able to hide. Instead of letting the alliance investigation team find out, it is better to confess directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance will not directly kill us, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find someone to do some activities, maybe you can turn big things into small ones. There is only one corruption case left and right, just make up for the shortfall. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Agiron said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, there is nothing wrong with \"leniency for confession\". But the current situation is obviously different. It involves the game between the Alpha Kingdom and the Alliance, and it is inevitable to make a fuss about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop dreaming, Agieron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we disclose all the reselling of military supplies by the nobles in the country, the alliance will not let us off easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this kind of betrayal of colleagues is done, how will we mess around in China in the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the mastermind who targeted us knows to abide by the rules of the game. It's just a secret layout and promotion, rather than directly showing evidence to the investigation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps now, people have already dug a hole, just waiting for the few of us to jump into it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Dias' words put all the contradictions on the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dilemma faced by the nobles in the Northlands seems to be a case of reselling military supplies, but in fact it is a contradiction accumulated in the past. At this moment, a general outbreak happened to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    External: The alliance investigation team wants to use them as a breakthrough to find an excuse to kick the Alpha Kingdom out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal: All the great powers in the kingdom who have a feud with them are waiting to see their jokes and throw trouble at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"jingle bell, jingle bell...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bell outside the door rang suddenly, interrupting the plot of the five people. In order to keep it secret, no one was kept within a 100-meter radius of the camp, and the bell would be rang whenever something important happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sith, what's going on outside?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After rushing out of the camp, Duke Kavadia asked the young man in the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, the people from the alliance investigation team are here. This time they brought a lot of people, along with Archduke Efiero and the Earl of Hudson...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The string of names that Sith spat out made everyone immediately realize that there was a big problem. Just when everyone was thinking about countermeasures, the team had already appeared in their sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the guards in the army did not stop the people who came, or they didn't dare to stop them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at each other, the five sighed helplessly. What should come will come after all. At this time, no matter what happens, we can only face it calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Cavadia, Duke Pias, Ya... the five will explain themselves, or should we interrogate?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jerome's words gave the five people an ominous premonition. In the world of nobility, everyone usually stays on the front line when doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is an enemy, they will deliberately restrain themselves in front of outsiders. There are very few questions that directly overturn the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, we don't understand what you are talking about. Explain, what do we need to explain?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia struggled hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the trembling of his body revealed his inner anxiety. Reason told him that today's incident is likely to be because the investigation team has the evidence of reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the last sliver of luck made them unwilling to plead guilty like this. As the great nobles of the human race, unless there is tangible evidence, it is impossible to convict them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is a bet on how much evidence the investigation team has. If the evidence is not sufficient, then throwing a few scapegoats out may be able to calm the turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that you are not ready to plead guilty. But it doesn't matter, we already have enough evidence in our hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this box are the confessions of relevant personnel, in the box on the right are the materials before and after the warehouse was burned, and in the back box are the delivery time and transaction targets of your reselling military supplies...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Kaveh's words gave the five people a glimmer of hope, followed by a burst of despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so much evidence thrown out, it's hard to deny it even if you want to. Even if they secretly have contact with the Holy See, it is impossible for the people of the Holy See to come out and protect them directly at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even asking for mercy will only help you more and more. It is the Alpha Kingdom that can really give them a hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the case of reselling military supplies is not only an international case, but also a major corruption case within the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a sovereign country, the Alpha Kingdom has the right to fight for them alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grand Duke Efiero and Earl of Hudson, do you just watch them slander the nobles of the kingdom?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias asked in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, he secretly regretted it. It is obviously not what a wise man should do to provoke one's enemies at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we only focus on the facts. The truth cannot be false, and the false cannot be true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is watching from the sidelines, and I believe that the investigation team will give you an objective and fair result. Before that, I suggest that you should cooperate well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you confess the evidence yourself, at least you can get a lighter sentence, so that you won't make a fuss and become notorious! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearly half of the evidence in the hands of the investigation team was sponsored by him free of charge, and the remaining half was provided by other parties one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt about the authenticity, all of them can stand the test. Being able to get it on the table today means that it is time for a showdown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, a few. Don't you dare to do it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the nobles, if you do such insane things, the kingdom will regard you as a shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What to do next, I don't think there is any need to continue prompting. The evidence is all here, if you don't want to, you can check it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I hope you can take up the responsibilities on your shoulders, don't let your family be ashamed, don't let the nobles of the kingdom be ashamed of you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, he doesn't mind the northern nobles mutinying on the spot. As long as they make trouble, the royal family can use the name of suppressing the rebellion to pull out this unsightly nail in one fell swoop.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Judging from the reactions of all parties, it is obvious that an agreement was reached in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armistice negotiations have begun, and it is only a matter of time before the army withdraws, and the case of reselling military supplies has also come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evidence in the hands of the alliance investigation team is enough to testify against the five dukes. If they continue to dig deeper along the chain of evidence, more nobles of the kingdom will definitely be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In investigation, the more people dug out, the better. The problems found so far are enough for the alliance to come up with a bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dead friends don't die poor people. The nobles of the kingdom with a guilty conscience don't want to spend time in uncertainty, even if they want to separate themselves from the orc prairie, they all want to close the case quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the common will of all parties, the case of reselling military supplies was found on the five dukes, and it was time to end it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coincidentally, their cards are big enough. Taking it out to scare chickens and monkeys is enough to give an explanation to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are just the apparent unlucky reasons for the northern nobles. It was the warning issued by Grand Duke Afiero that really broke the Duke of Cavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meaning is very obvious: either a few of them take the initiative to resist the crime of reselling military supplies and take full responsibility for it;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether passive or active, the charges on his head are absolutely indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that if you take the initiative to plead guilty, everyone will look better, and you can leave them with some dignity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the laughter, Duke Cavadia asked bitterly: \"Your Excellency, we have nothing to say about the case of reselling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evidence is all here, and we don't need to explain anything more if we think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the fact that we have made great contributions to the kingdom and the human race, can you give us a little time to arrange the funeral first? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the end of the five Northern Dukes, Hudson felt hesitant. Obviously, the great nobles are not absolutely safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was behind all of this, the root cause of the end of the five dukes was actually—the failure to adjust their mentality in time and grasp their own positioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crime of reselling military supplies has always been ambiguous. When you want to deal with it, it's too big to pierce the sky; when you don't want to deal with it, you can pretend you didn't see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the orc empire has fallen, the pressure on the defense of the northern border has disappeared, and the original special status of the nobles in the northern region no longer exists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the five major families adjust their mentality in time, then when the nobles make up their shortfalls, they should also join the rush to buy supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you offend someone, as a nobleman, no one needs a few vests, just change your identity and buy them. It's all business, who wants to investigate the origin of the buyer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joining the rush to buy materials, not to mention can plug all the gaps, at least it can fill most of the holes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only that, the addition of several of them led to a shortage of strategic materials. It is estimated that most of the nobles will find it difficult to fill the gap, and the number of unlucky people involved in the case of reselling military supplies is bound to increase greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone participated, and they all left holes, which is equivalent to normal transportation loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone finds a way to cover the cover together, even the alliance investigation team will find it difficult to find anything. At the very least, no one will keep providing clues to the other party and constantly guide the investigation team to find evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the five unlucky guys in front of them obviously didn't realize the seriousness of the problem in advance. In other words, the response was a step slower, and by the time they realized the problem, they were already in a dangerous situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the northern nobles are a large group, and the kingdom has always taken good care of them. Even in the human alliance, they are well-known, but that is based on the premise that they are useful to the kingdom and the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that he has lost his greatest value, if he wants to continue to occupy the original privilege, it is obviously a way to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please do yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said pretendingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the original plan, there are some differences. But the five dukes were finished, the nobles of the North were seriously injured, and the biggest hidden danger in the kingdom that threatened the royal power was eliminated. He was still very happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the five dukes making their wills and arranging heirs to take over the family, Hudson immediately understood what they were going to do next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doomed to die, you can arrange your own death, and you can also declare to the outside world that you are infected with the plague, so as to preserve your last decency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is executed by the alliance or the kingdom for the crime of reselling military supplies, he will lose all dignity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the kingdom's approach still pays attention to human touch. The accountability is limited to themselves, and the family behind them is not implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their death is to give an explanation to all parties, and the children of the next generation can also inherit the title and fiefdom. The great nobleman is still a great nobleman, but suffered a short-term setback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith, who has been following the Duke of Kavadia, is very injured at this moment. As an illegitimate child, he has no right of inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much she is favored by her own father, at this time, she can only lean back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tears fell to the ground, even if they were tens of meters away, Hudson could feel the sadness in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no eggs under the whole nest. The towering tree fell, how could the birds and beasts that depended on the tree not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Entering the era of cheap younger brothers, if his illegitimate elder brother who is an eyesore, if he doesn't take advantage of the chaos and run away quickly, he may not even have the chance to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the world is so big, where is his destination?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Return to the southeast province, stop dreaming. From the moment he chose to step out, the way back had been cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The incident happened so suddenly that even the internal affairs of the family could not be arranged. The Duke of Kavadia had no time to arrange for his illegitimate son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar unlucky ones among the northern nobles. A sudden change of power will inevitably trigger a new round of reshuffle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people who are attached to this political group will face regrouping. Countless people will be kicked out of the power center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death of the five great dukes marked the end of the weird political group of the northern aristocracy. In the future, the five major families may still hold together to keep warm, but it is impossible to represent the entire Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An era has been sent away, and Hudson's work has become more and more busy. As the commander-in-chief of the army, he will inevitably be punished, but he has to do the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such thing as grabbing shifts and seizing power. Everyone knows how troublesome the follow-up work will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the distribution of benefits after the war, if the work is not done properly, a large group of people will come out to make trouble. There is no doubt that the person in charge must be responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson personally felt that life felt like years. Originally, he wanted to share the share with Grand Duke Efiero, but the chicken thief waited for the general situation to be certain, and immediately ran back to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the mess on the front line was left to Hudson. Now he not only has to guarantee the logistics of the coalition army, but also must appease the mentally broken Northland army, and by the way, he must also prevent and control the plague, and call a group of noble officers to discuss the distribution of benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After trying their best, they managed to barely maintain the order on the front line. But that's all, wanting to do more is obviously beyond the scope of authority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, he, the coach, only has the right to suggest the specific distribution of benefits, but not the final decision-making power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Know without thinking, Caesar III, who always likes to mix sand and play with balance, will definitely not miss this opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows what's going on, but everyone's dissatisfaction will only be directed at him, the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to send this report to the capital!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said a little tiredly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a lot of complicated work, which makes him more tired than fighting. But at a time like this, he couldn't let go of the picker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"rights\" and \"responsibilities\" of nobles have always been equal. I have enjoyed the benefit bonus brought by the coach before, and now I have to bear the responsibility and obligations of the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson still can't do the thing of running away. Now he only hopes that the alliance negotiations will end quickly, and then quickly finalize the distribution of benefits within the kingdom, so that he can pack up and go home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it has been two years since he led the troops out to the present. Three years have passed since the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long war has exhausted the entire Alpha Kingdom. It can be said that every day the war lasts will bring heavy losses to this ancient kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, as the winner of a new round of political struggle, Caesar III is in a very good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson took the blame for Hudson, many people suspected that he designed the nobles of the Northland, that's not a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death of the five great dukes dealt a heavy blow to the Northland aristocratic group. The internal power change alone will prevent this small group from causing trouble for him in the next few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of kingship was further consolidated. The aristocratic forces within the kingdom have returned to the era of balance, and they are no longer dominated by one family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that his health is getting worse. When the situation was so good, there were bloodstains in his coughing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being physically weak, Caesar III could only speed up the training of his son. When the external threat disappeared and the internal situation was good, as long as the king didn't deliberately kill himself, nothing major would happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think of the fief distribution plan reported by Earl Hudson, Little Caesar?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This report is full of compromises. Earl Hudson is taking the interests of the kingdom and selling favors for himself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said with a frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the first time that the frontline has sent similar reports. It's just that every time, he can't satisfy him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when it comes to the specific distribution of fiefdoms, there are only four words from the beginning to the end—humanity and sophistication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Original combat achievements are also an important reference standard. It's a pity that the main task of the army is to **** food and grass, and no one's credit is much higher than anyone else's.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go back, a group of guys who have lost battles, talking about military exploits is nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really subdivided, the expeditionary force led by Hudson has an advantage in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that most of these military exploits were made in the Principality of Moxi. The owner of the family has already paid the bounty, and it is impossible for the kingdom to pay it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final allocation of fiefs, the main thing is to see the contribution to the kingdom, not the contribution to the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that Hudson is not a master of power for personal gain, and everything is played according to the rules of political games. So much so that every time the plan is reported, it is full of human sophistication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the inevitable result. No matter who is in Hudson's position, the content of the report that will eventually be sent up will be similar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put forward your opinions according to your ideas, type the report back, and let him modify it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the coach and the king are playing a game, but in fact it is the frontline nobles who are playing a game with the royal power. As the coach, Hudson is just a middleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is a process of constant exploration and compromise. Bargaining is a lengthy process unless the situation is one-sided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Continue to revise, I am afraid there will be no results. Hudson is not a master who can take care of things. When encountering a little problem, he has to keep asking for instructions and reporting, as if he has no idea at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on his style, it is estimated that he called a group of great nobles for a meeting, and then came up with a settlement full of compromises! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince said dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All along, he didn't like Hudson. Even after such a long time, he still couldn't forget the tragic experience in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his opinion, the big defeat that day was largely due to the absence of the First Army led by Hudson, otherwise the outcome of the war would have been rewritten long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he has received a complete royal education after all, and he hides this hatred very well. Outsiders don't even know that he holds a grudge against Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Earl of Hudson, who can command an army of millions, has no opinion at all. Little Caesar, is this your judgment?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked with a look of disappointment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson has not achieved much since he became the commander-in-chief of the army. Being able to command millions of troops without causing trouble is a remarkable achievement in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially so many armies in the kingdom, most of them are improvised cannon fodder troops. No matter where it is placed, it can explode on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, Hudson's coaching position was above a powder keg. Preventing the powder keg from exploding is the greatest achievement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for making contributions. No one would be foolish enough to imagine that a group of rabble can achieve amazing results on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing the change in Caesar III's attitude, the crown prince frowned slightly and said: \"It cannot be said that Earl Hudson has no opinions at all, but his performance during his tenure as coach was not satisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the follow-up war against the Orc Empire, the army of the kingdom was completely reduced to spectators, causing our international status to drop drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are also reasons for the heavy losses of our army, as the commander-in-chief of the army, Earl Hudson should also bear part of the responsibility. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with this explanation. In the eyes of many kingdom radicals, Hudson's performance is indeed substandard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this judgment, which is exactly the opposite of the opinion of the older generation. Only those who have experienced the horrors of the orcs can understand the importance of a \"steady\" commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fool!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are so many senior military generals in the kingdom, and no one has expressed any objection. Why should you, a defeated guy, come out to comment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Hudson didn't do much, but he preserved the strength for the kingdom and won enough right to speak. Isn't this more valuable than a victory you said?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince, you need to think objectively and fairly, instead of being led by others! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III couldn't help reprimanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he was not angry because the crown prince underestimated Hudson, but because he was worried about his son's eyesight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountered a problem, only knowing to focus on the problem itself is undoubtedly very dangerous for a ruler.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this biased way of looking at problems is the most difficult to change. It is difficult to complete the strategic extension of vision without making fundamental cognitive changes from the bottom of the heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a split second, Crown Prince Caesar's face darkened. He shouldn't be unable to see these problems. But the prejudice deep in his heart made him choose to ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After he came to his senses, not only did he not relax, but he became more and more heavy. It has always been easy to find your own problems, but difficult to change them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

From the date of signing the treaty, both sides stop all acts of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no war reparations, no punishment for war criminals, and there is not even a clear conclusion on who is the righteous side in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that this treaty is very similar to the continent of Aslante. Race wars are all fighting for the living space of their respective races, and there is no distinction between justice and evil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a witness of history, Hudson has been a spectator from beginning to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stems from strength. The orcs suffer from the armistice treaty, which is the price of losing the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc prairie is owned by the human race, and the mountains and wastelands currently occupied by the coalition forces belong to the orc race who defected to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was clearly arranged by the coalition forces. The Orc Empire can only recognize it with its nose. It is better to have a group of orcs as a strategic buffer than directly bordering the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as there are no major changes in the future, the orc empire can continue forever. After all, the human race has no interest in the bad land they occupy now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the signing of the treaty, the alliance became lively. Around the distribution of spoils, all parties have started arguing again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As much as they looked down on the orc prairie in the past, the competition is now as fierce as it is. There is no doubt that the nobles are a bunch of duplicity masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But all of this has nothing to do with the Alpha Kingdom. Fortunately, the boundary line was moved hundreds of miles away before, otherwise there would really be no gain at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is busy dividing up the loot, but Hudson, the logistics manager, is in a hurry to drive people away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is over, and the follow-up strategic materials naturally do not exist. Every day the coalition forces stay on the front line, they are eating stocks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't involve his own interests, so Hudson doesn't care about it, and the tricks of all parties are wrangling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the coalition command meeting, Hudson formally submitted his resignation. Prior to this, he had completed the final distribution of strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the accounts, all the logistics materials of the coalition forces have been distributed, and his duties as the logistics manager have come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no retention. Everyone was busy competing for interests, and even the withdrawal of the Alpha Kingdom did not cause any waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with follow-up questions, Hudson is not clear. The main reason is that the area of ​​the orc prairie is too vast, exceeding the sum of the three Alpha kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a vast land, once developed, will be the foundation of an emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a big cake and so many human forces participating in the distribution of spoils, it is obviously impossible to monopolize it. The future grassland pattern will definitely be very lively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the army back home, Hudson's position as coach has also reached the head. He didn't need anyone to come over to hint, he handed in his resignation on his own initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, many things backfired. The more he wanted to resign, the more Caesar III refused to give in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not because he valued his abilities, the main reason is that there is no coach standing in front of him, and the subsequent distribution of benefits will be directed at the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every day, there is a muddle, and the parties are arguing endlessly about the distribution of benefits. Vital interests are involved, and it will not work for anyone who comes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Viscount, are you really ready to move north?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the second family in the southeastern province, the Holliser family's foundations are all in the south. According to the previous plan, it was also to expand to the Fengyun Province, but I didn't expect to choose to move north in a blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the north has the greatest chance at present. With the northern nobles suffering heavy losses, even the local snakes that hindered their development to the north no longer exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But all this is theoretical. The several unowned provinces newly recovered in northern Xinjiang are all uninhabited areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difficulty of becoming a master is indeed low, but the manpower, material resources, and financial resources required to develop these areas are astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Koslow family does not have this strength. Even if Hudson made a fortune during the war, he still couldn't afford the huge development cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a veteran aristocrat in the kingdom, the accumulation of heritage of the Holliser family is far beyond that of an upstart like the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the decision is made to move the strategic center of gravity to the north, the manpower gap should be resolved quickly. As for whether the financial and material resources can support it, that is beyond Hudson's knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, the family has no choice but to make this decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic forces in the entire southeastern province suffered heavy losses in this war. According to the original plan to participate in the competition against Fengyun Province, the Holliser family has no chance of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a huge gap between the medium nobles and the great nobles. Once this opportunity is missed, it is unknown when the next time will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family can't afford to wait, and I can't wait even more. We have no better choice than to choose the land of Northern Xinjiang, which has relatively weak competition! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Viscount Oran looked at Hudson enviously. As the biggest upstart in this war, the Koslow family already possesses the strength to challenge the Dalton family, so there is no need to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just before that, a large number of nobles were killed in the southeastern province, which made room for the development of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson still has a lot of convenience. At least when choosing a fief, it has priority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current military strength of the Koslow family, it is entirely dependent on the continuous collection of scattered fiefdoms, and they share the southeastern province with the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, when it comes to specific operations, fief replacement must be indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these operations are theoretically not allowed, but as the commander of the army, as long as he does not go too far, the king will probably give him some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminiscent of the fact that Hudson made friends in the aristocratic circles in the province before, Viscount Oran understood his calculation in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The existence of human debts undoubtedly created favorable conditions for the subsequent integration of fiefdom replacement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small and medium-sized nobles in the province, even if they don't want to see the Koslow family grow and grow, they can't come out to oppose it due to the existence of favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only obstacles are probably the Dalton family and the king. Based on what he knew about Caesar III, even if the king objected, he would not end it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Hudson still has value to the royal family. Faced with the chaotic distribution of interests in the country, the king still needs Hudson to be at the front to mediate the conflicts among all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the Dalton family, even if they stand up against it, it can't hinder Hudson's determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Viscount Oran became more determined in his choice. The southeastern province has entered into a pattern of confrontation between the two powers. Where is the room for the development of the Holliser family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original provincial second family is now directly downgraded to the third family. If you don't take the initiative to leave, it will be a tragedy when the boss fights with the second child in the future and beats the third child to death by mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Viscount, you can rest assured. After the strategic center of gravity of the Holliser family moves northward, your foundation in Arbor County will not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of failure to manage the Northland, Arbor County can be your retreat. However, this is a big matter, and I suggest you consider it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current competition in Fengyun Province is indeed fierce, but if the Holliser family is willing to give it a go, there is still a one-third chance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are true words. If Hudson were in the position of Viscount Oran, he would not be able to make the decision to move the strategic center of gravity northward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competition in Fengyun Province is fierce, but the interests inside are also great! A well-developed province is far more valuable than a piece of raw land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are unable to seize control of the province, it is a good choice to seize the land of a county or half a county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the Holliser family's appetite is too great, and they want to step into the threshold of the great nobles in one fell swoop and add a few fiefdoms, which can no longer satisfy their appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing can only be decided by yourself. As an ally, all Hudson can do is support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I'll leave it to you from now on. We will find a way to coordinate all aspects of the relationship, but the king's capital still needs your help to speak.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not talk about specific goals. Obviously, the Holliser family is not sure of winning this operation. In order to increase the success rate, they simply cast a wide net.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, this is also a good thing. It would be troublesome if the target of the Holliser family collided with other nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like the current situation, although it is possible for several middle-level nobles to jointly dominate a province, it also avoids the tragedy of crashing and being eliminated directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is still not strong enough. No matter how profound the background is, it will take a long process to transform it into the strength at hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Earl Pierce also did a good thing. If he hadn't brought all the nobles in the southeastern province into the gutter, the Holliser family would never have escaped so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone huddled together to develop, no matter how good the relationship with each other is, sooner or later there will be a day of turning heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voluntary departure of the Holliser family is also a good thing for Hudson. This means that the two will not become enemies because of strategic conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Viscount, there will definitely be a fief of yours in the Northland, and the area is only much larger than that of Arbor County!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson promised proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, he still has a great say in the division of fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family wants to become a great nobleman. He doesn't have the ability, but it is not difficult for them to enter the Northland to get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, it depends on their own development. Whoever has the best development and stands out from the crowd of competitors first will be able to cross the threshold of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The game involved in this is not only within the kingdom, but also forces outside the kingdom participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, many great nobles in the Alpha Kingdom have their ancestors from countries in the southern and central parts of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the passage of time, this relationship has become very weak, but as the major forces of the human race carve up the orc prairie, this relationship has been further promoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, to develop the Orc Prairie next, it is necessary to obtain the support of the neighbor of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have connections, naturally have to get in touch. No matter how far this relationship is, there is still a bit of love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson himself felt it. The branch of the Koslow family extended abroad, and some people came to visit him to contact him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these branches are the same as the branches in China, and the mix is ​​not very good. Even if the faction they belong to takes away a big piece of cake, all they can get is the baronial or knightly collar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running over to make contact is essentially seeking support. Within the scope of authority, Hudson provided them with convenience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small Koslow family is like this, let alone the big nobles of other kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the next major reshuffle, whether the Holliser family can stand out depends not only on the efforts of the Oran Viscounts, but also on the support behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another fief division plan was continuously released from Hudson's hands, and kept being beaten back, making the army angry from top to bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the angry crowd, Hudson also pretended to be annoyed and said: \"The capital once again rejected our proposal, and the new plan that will be discussed next, everyone should sign on it together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the capital continues to veto it, then everyone pack up and go directly to the capital to discuss with the ministers! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    and slime are also limited. Facing the anger of the nobles, Hudson thought that his body was not strong enough, so there was no need to fight hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the king, he can only say that he did his best. It is simply impossible for a group of nobles to take the initiative to accept sand mixing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's time to do this, I've been procrastinating like this, when will it be the end!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Carles pretended not to know and agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, everyone responded one after another, as if they were all tired of the king not doing anything, and wanted to group together to put pressure on the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is acting, the whole is a big theater. Hudson was very helpless about this farce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how many times the plan has been revised, it is essentially the original plan. The only difference probably lies in the slight changes in everyone's fief boundaries every time they are revised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't observe carefully, you may not be able to find it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last modification seems to be putting pressure on the capital, and Hudson deliberately said it to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remind everyone with practical actions: the king also needs face, and now is the time to make appropriate concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all of this is doomed to be useless. It cannot be said that the king's cards in front of the great nobles are completely absent, but it is not that great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone refused to make substantive concessions, and Hudson didn't bother to be a villain, so he directly reported the final results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the collective absence of the northern nobles, this document signed collectively by all the great nobles in the kingdom itself can represent the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, looking at the final report, Caesar III looked very ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one needs to complain about anyone, everyone's demands are too much. Not to mention the nobles of other kingdoms, just looking at Hudson's own request, there are projects that cannot be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the expansion of fiefdoms in the southeastern province, as long as the issue of enclaves is not considered, it is reasonable to take away part of the unclaimed land with Hudson's contribution in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in addition to these demands, he also proposed to recover \"the ancestral land of the Koslow family\". This \"ancestral land\" is not just a castle, but the entire territory of the original Koslow family in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is impossible for the Lochnard family to accept. Even if they suffered heavy losses before, it is impossible for the Koslow family to extend their tentacles to their own hinterland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all issues left over from history, and it is impossible for the kingdom to overturn the case of the Koslow family, or else it will be a large-scale historical overturning scene, and the legitimacy of countless noble fiefdoms will be challenged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that it is impossible to complete, Hudson still wants to raise it. This is a matter of principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, Caesar III could only jump out and veto the proposal. Similar to impossible proposals, there are still many reports to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What made him most unacceptable was that the nobles in the kingdom chose to compromise with each other, instead of checking and balancing each other as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Voted again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he picked up the pen, Caesar III hesitated again. Everything is too much, even if you are a king, you must consider the position of the nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a joint-stock country with dispersed shares, and as the king of the major shareholder, he cannot fully promise what he promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating again and again, Caesar III took a pen to annotate and revise the report. This kind of fine-tuning is destined to be done only by him himself, and counting on everyone's self-consciousness is purely dreaming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince on the side watched quietly from beginning to end. It's not that he doesn't want to get involved, he really doesn't know how to deal with such a complicated situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The modification work was completed, and after checking it, Caesar III slowly raised his head and said: \"Prime Minister, send the final result to Earl Hudson, and let him find a way to persuade all parties to accept it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone pays attention to the content of his annotations, they will find that this is a naked transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's appeal, except for the unrealistic plan to recover the ancestral land, the rest of the requirements were basically met.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the price for obtaining all this, he must find a way to implement the king's will. If it can't be done, Caesar III's endorsement can only be invalidated accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if major concessions are made, it is still difficult for Caesar III's plan to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, tell the high-ranking generals in the army to come over for a meeting!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered with a blank face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how difficult it is, you must make a gesture of hard work. It's one thing to be able to do it, it's another thing not to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that Caesar III himself has no extravagant expectations, and everything is carried out according to his plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal family may seem majestic, but since the failure of the last Northern Expedition, its influence in the army has begun to decline, which is also an indisputable fact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of noble officers who were close to the royal family were killed, and the new generation of the royal family had no time to replace them. The king's voice in the army had dropped to its lowest point in decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the core reason why Caesar III tried his best to destroy the hill of northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knocking out the largest force in the army does not mean that the royal family's control over the army has been strengthened. Just one Marquis of James can't hold his ground at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If no one was available, Caesar III would not have picked Hudson as a slippery man to implement his political plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the results, you can tell that a slicker is a slicker, and he doesn't work hard at all when doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all determined by status. As a member of the great nobles, it is impossible for Hudson to completely sit on the king's side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made Hudson's superiority purely a coincidence, not a direct descendant of the king's promotion?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson's current situation is also a bit embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the commander-in-chief of this level of war, even if it was not the king himself, was also a direct descendant of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who came to power by accident, could neither fully support the king nor the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to play balance in the middle, and if I am a little careless, I will not be human inside and out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, when the two sides are at an impasse, he, the middleman, is the most difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the mentality is not strong enough, it is easy to mistake the whole kingdom and work hard by yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Lutetia, the Terran Alliance meeting is once again in chaos. Around the interests of the prairie, the parties have been deadlocked for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the grasslands are also divided into different classes. Some areas with fertile water and grass can completely develop fertile land and develop farming civilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the Orc Empire has already started to do it. In the huge orc prairie, one-fifth of the area is farmland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also subject to the low level of civilization of the orcs. If it is replaced by the human race in the past, the degree of development and utilization will definitely increase significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the water source is sufficient, the terrain is flat, and the soil quality is good, farming civilization can be developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other small problems can completely change nature with manpower. At least for a group of major forces, it is not difficult at all to change the natural environment in a certain area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But theories are just theories after all. If there are mature and good lands, naturally no one wants to pick up bad lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides the land issue, there are endless disputes about the rule of the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people advocate a complete split into multiple countries, some advocate the establishment of a unified country, and some advocate the establishment of a loose federation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major forces all take their own interests as the starting point, and no one is willing to make concessions, which makes the meeting process very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this situation, Charles III, as the host, was about to lose all his hair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to quarrel, just go out and quarrel with me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's the fuss? Since the controversy is endless, let's vote directly. Everyone is the elite of my human race, how can it be like a vegetable market? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III's rant seems to be solving the problem, but it is actually a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Voting can indeed produce results, but it does not mean that voting is a panacea for solving problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the distribution of benefits can be completed based on the voting results, but the hidden dangers of conflicts cannot be resolved by one round of voting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that there is no better choice right now. As the initiator of the alliance meeting, it is necessary to give the meeting a happy ending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how many hidden dangers were left and how many mines were planted, Charles III could no longer take care of so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are a lot of internal conflicts in the human race, and adding a little more will not hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then, as His Majesty said, each makes a proposal and directly proceeds with the standard. The proposal with the highest vote rate will be the resolution of the alliance!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson added along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See, as the biggest shit-stirring stick in the Terran Alliance. This kind of work of digging pits and laying mines has always been their favorite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only pity is: they are a religious organization, and when they play politics, they are always linked with religion, so that they often make neither fish nor fowl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, as many as a dozen proposals were proposed. It can be seen that everyone still maintained restraint, and representatives of the small forces all chose to turn off the fire with self-knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The war is over. To continue to maintain the existing huge armaments will put too much pressure on the kingdom. After careful research, the command decided to carry out a large-scale disarmament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the threat of the orc empire disappears, the military pressure on the future kingdom will be greatly reduced, so the number of standing troops will also be greatly reduced compared with the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I personally think that the number of the kingdom's standing army is maintained at 50,000 to 80,000, which can meet the current military needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the kingdom's current financial pressure, the number of the kingdom's standing army can be further reduced in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specific standards, we can continue to study. The top priority now is to abolish the redundant army to reduce the kingdom's military expenditure! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the military meeting, Hudson tried his best to promote the theory of disarmament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, the Alpha Kingdom's vitality was seriously injured, especially the financial loss, which was the heaviest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge debt pressure has overwhelmed the kingdom. It can be said that the abolition of the army is imperative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get out of the game between the king and the noble group, Hudson decisively chose-disarmament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, this happens to be his job. Come out to preside over disarmament at such a time to reduce the financial pressure on the kingdom, that is a proper loyalty to the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, it also solved the biggest hidden danger for Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the noble army disbands and goes home, the next game is a purely political struggle, and there is no need to worry about the parties collapsing midway and turning into a military conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, we have no objection to disbanding the army after the war is over. This is what should be done, and it is nothing more than a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the number of the kingdom's standing army is too small, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that the kingdom has maintained a standing army of more than 300,000 people all year round. How can it match our international status by reducing so many establishments at once?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, while the kingdom regained lost ground, it also gained a small amount. It is entirely possible for us to maintain a larger army to demonstrate our status as the third most powerful country in the Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce took the lead in objecting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that there was a conspiracy in Hudson's plan. Although I don't know what this is planning, the direct opposition supported by the enemy is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the kingdom's military pressure has disappeared, and the reduction of the standing army is the right thing to do. But Earl Pierce was very disturbed in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the number of the kingdom's standing army has been greatly reduced, but the number of private troops of the nobles has not been restricted, which is very beneficial to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is for the great nobles whose strength is intact. The aristocratic forces whose strength has been greatly weakened, or are on the verge of collapse, are in urgent need of the kingdom's protection at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family naturally did not fall to this point, but it is an indisputable fact that their vitality has been severely injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no threat from competitors, I will slowly recover after going back to recuperate for ten or eight years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, they are not only threatened by competitors, but also powerful competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comprehensive strength The Dalton family can easily suppress the Koslow family, but they are unfortunately at a disadvantage in terms of current military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout the ages, countless cases have proved that only the strength transformed into military strength is the real hard power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a deep foundation and a strong heritage, it also requires a transformation process. Everything is a dream until it is completely transformed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Pierce, your worries are completely unnecessary. The strength of the kingdom has never been represented by a small standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Frankish Kingdom, the most powerful country on the mainland, has only about 200,000 standing troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this war, we can see that the previous war model is constantly being subverted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next thing we need to do most is to adapt to the new war mode and cultivate more elite soldiers, rather than just pile up numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    50,000 extraordinary troops, the combat power that can be exploded may not be much worse than the original standing army of more than 300,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the kingdom is short of labor, we must use the least manpower input in exchange for the greatest combat effectiveness. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This little trouble can't trouble him at all. The background of the large-scale disarmament is that the kingdom's financial resources and labor force have suffered a huge deficit at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the problem has arisen, it needs to be solved. Taking advantage of the trend to launch military system reform is also inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Starting next month, the Kingdom will no longer provide logistical supplies to the Grand Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you think you can support so many troops, it is also possible to continue to retain the current huge armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the number of nobles' private troops is unlimited. There is no decree in the kingdom that stipulates the size of the nobles' private army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the king didn't want to issue a similar decree. The problem is that all the nobles below are princes of one side, and it's impossible to agree to such a self-binding decree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In some special periods, the strength of some great nobles once surpassed that of the king, which is nothing new.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the Alliance Parliament issued an announcement that three kingdoms and four duchies will be established in the Orc Prairie, and the name of the country is currently being solicited from the outside world.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Tom's words, Hudson frowned slightly. The structure of the Three Kingdoms and the Four Principalities is undoubtedly the result of compromise between all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the orc prairie in the future would be full of small countries, but I didn't expect that the integration had already been completed just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability to unite to build a country is obviously the result of the formation of multiple forces. For the meaning of the Alpha Kingdom, it really shouldn't be too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a high-level executive in the Kingdom, Hudson now has to broaden his horizons and consider issues from an international perspective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The birth of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms did not threaten the survival of the Alpha Kingdom in a short period of time, but it also blocked the future expansion of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vast orc prairie, even if it is divided into seven, it will not be a small country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the structure surrounded by great powers, the development space of the Alpha Kingdom is basically locked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Break the game, forget it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a rising star nobleman, Hudson has not yet had such great ambitions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, everyone doing this can be regarded as giving the Alpha Kingdom enough face. If they intentionally set up a unified country in the orc prairie, that would really make the Alpha Kingdom sleepless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is busy digesting the fruits of victory. For a long time to come, there will be no major conflicts between the parties, which is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the newly emerged seven crowns, Hudson didn't bother to bother. Anyway, no matter who is in charge, it will not be his turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, where bloodlines are important, the throne is always something that one is born with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not no cases of counterattacks against superiors, but they are all jointly promoted by the right time, place and people. Without any of these links, it is impossible to succeed in the counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has two sides. The great changes on the grassland also have a positive side for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson's current troubles can basically be passed safely. In the face of potential border threats, it is also very necessary to properly strengthen the strength of the nobles in the border areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, Caesar III will soon choose to make concessions and let the great nobles in the country plant their flags in the border provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the previous restrictions on movement were essentially worried about their expansion northward after they gained a firm foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the hope of expanding to the north is cut off, there is no point in staring at everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is destined to be happy and sad again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, according to the previous distribution model, the big nobles take 40%, the middle nobles take 25%, and the small nobles take the last 35%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the royal family still had one, but this time the situation is special. The royal family regained the homeland of the three provinces, and everyone also helped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land of these three provinces alone is enough for the royal family to digest for decades. As a wise man, Caesar III would naturally not be greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the map hanging on the wall, Hudson smiled slightly. Regardless of how the north changes, it has nothing to do with him, a noble from southern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same applies to aristocrats when people leave their hometowns and are humble. The old aristocrat's network of contacts spread all over the place, even if the strategic focus is shifted, they can integrate into the new circle in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For upstarts like the Koslow family, it is better to stay where they are. If you break into a new circle rashly, you will only be eaten and wiped clean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of northern aristocrats who went south before is the best example. Even if the backstage is hard enough, it's still hard enough to be tossed by local snakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for those guys following the right boss this time, it is estimated that they will be liquidated after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with Hudson following them, the dividends of this war have nothing to do with them now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All because they are the nobles of the North!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoying the benefits brought by the political interest group of the northern aristocrats, they have to bear the corresponding backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the northern aristocratic group is being suppressed in the kingdom, the development of these northern aristocratic children is naturally limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of political suppression will continue in the next few years, or even decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made the nobles of the North land offend the kingdom all over the place when they were strong, and they happened to be caught by everyone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, apart from themselves, the rest are all political enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that their geographical location and the strength they possess seriously threaten the interests of the kingdom's nobles in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless everyone feels that the potential threat disappears, this kind of suppression will always be accompanied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way to get out of this predicament is to wait. Time can dilute everything, and when everyone gradually forgets the threat of the northern nobles, the relationship can be normalized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to speed up this process, such as the most common operation: political marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to notify the think tank and ask them to come up with a plan to deal with the changing situation in the kingdom as soon as possible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After working hard for so long, I finally got together a team of think tanks. It's a pity that it is still too immature and is currently in the internship stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, it's okay to help with trivial matters. Once major political changes are involved, the shortcoming of lack of vision is immediately exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by birth. No matter how powerful the talents among the minor nobles were, the education they received since childhood still limited their horizons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson can only provide them with as many exercise opportunities as possible. Even if they know that it is difficult for them to see through the essence of the problem, they can only force them to comprehend it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing all of this, Hudson can only comfort himself: It's better to be almost capable, so as to avoid headaches after being poached.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competition between the great nobles has always been full of tricks, and poaching each other is also a common thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not poached, not because of how powerful he is, it is simply because there are no outstanding talents under his staff to make everyone look at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was the commander-in-chief, the Commander's Mansion was able to run smoothly because the auxiliary officers were all drawn from the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people serve the coach, not Hudson himself. If you leave your current position, people won't buy it in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Earl of Hudson has submitted his resignation again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, said with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three resignations and three requests\" is not popular in Aslante mainland. Generally, if you submit your resignation letter, it means you really want to resign.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the kingdom will not force nobles to hold important positions. After all, there is a shortage of everything in this world, except people who want to be officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, such a high-ranking position. As long as the wind is released, nobles who want to sit in this position can line up from the royal capital to Blood Moon Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the war is over, the disarmament work has also begun, and the requirements for the commander's ability have also dropped significantly. It seems that it is not difficult to change someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is only superficial. It seems that the kingdom is peaceful, but the undercurrents hidden underground never stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for a strong coach, the nobles in the kingdom would not be so peaceful. Going out to a duel after a disagreement has never been a new thing in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell Earl Hudson to let him take on the obligations of the nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the disarmament work is completed and the nobles from all walks of life in the kingdom return to their fiefdoms, I will agree to his resignation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before these tasks are completed, he, the coach, must be on duty! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's unbelievable to think about it. Other kings are worried that their powerful ministers will hold on to the military power and threaten the safety of the royal power. When he came to him, he became the coach and wanted to resign every day, and he, the king, refused to let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, he had long thought of a substitution. Perseveringly looking around at the generals in the army, he found helplessly that there were too few \"insiders\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct generals of the royal family either lack prestige and cannot convince the public; or they are not capable enough to take on this important task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to military power, one should never take it lightly. There were no troubles during the war, but if something happened in peacetime, it would be a shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is that once the big nobles grab the pigtails and want to do military affairs in the future, it will be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Earl of Hudson is in a hurry to resign, most likely because of the pressure exerted by the nobles in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to promote the disarmament plan, Earl Hudson also made a lot of efforts. It is said that there were several quarrels in the middle, but in the end he was forced to pass it as the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standing army of the kingdom has been greatly reduced this time, and the strength of the major nobles in the army may have been reduced to a disastrous extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not easy to not cause trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Afiero explained verbally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of the standing army has been reduced so badly, the most critical factor is-there is no money to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's fun to borrow money for a while, and the crematorium to repay the debt.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha has issued a large number of bonds one after another. Coupled with the foreign debts owed before, the Kingdom's finances have long been overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to save money, even the celebration banquet is kept simple. The administrative expenses that can be reduced in the kingdom have been reduced to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you save money, facing a huge debt of nearly 100 million yuan, it still seems like a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the repayment of the principal, but the payment of the interest on the funds alone put the Alpha Kingdom under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the many daily expenses of the kingdom, the largest expenditure is military expenditure. In the past, military expenditure could account for more than 60% of the total expenditure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why Hudson was immediately regarded as a \"great loyal minister\" by the high-level kingdom after Hudson proposed the disarmament plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest expense was cut off. The kingdom's finances, which were on the verge of bankruptcy, were rescued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there will be a hard life in the future, but it can be maintained after all, and there is no need to worry about financial bankruptcy all day long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the grassland is changing rapidly. The appearance of the Three Great Kingdoms and the Four Duchies is completely beyond our expectations. It is not an option to continue the stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find out Earl Hudson's last report, make a slight modification on it, and implement it as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with a sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Hudson can't bear the pressure, but in fact he, the king, can't bear the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the biggest feature of joint-stock countries. When the shareholders with more than half of the shares have the same position, they have the right to make decisions, and the king, as the major shareholder, has to compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes on the grassland only accelerated the time for compromise. In essence, the royal power was at a disadvantage in the game with the princes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes often occur in the continent of Aslante. It cannot be said that there are no kings who keep their promises, but overall they are still a minority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly resisting the pressure and doing it according to one's own will is not impossible in theory, but the sequelae are a bit serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, once or twice is not a big problem, if the frequency is too many, the people below will not be able to resist changing the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A wise monarch will compromise at the right time. After all, things like political games have always been long-term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the political goal was not achieved, and there is another chance. There is no need to put yourself on the opposite side of the noble group in order to win or lose for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the king and the nobles are in the same interest group. There may be conflicts due to internal distribution of spoils, but more often, they are still working together to maintain system governance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the interest settlement time for the kingdom's first batch of bonds is approaching. Would you like to imitate the Principality of Moxi and impose a debt repayment tax?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Chancellor of the Exchequer, he has not had a good day since the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the hairline on the head, you can tell that in the near future, there will be another bald man in the court of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't think about it. Next, they will develop new fiefs, which is the time to spend money. If you reach out to them at this time, it will be strange to get the money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find a way to collect a sum of money first, and settle the interest first. After a few months of delay, the following taxes will be sent up, and it will be enough to make up the gap. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III decisively vetoed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is too familiar with the style of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, asking everyone to pay for it is all about cutting flesh. In this peaceful age, if they continue to cut their flesh, they will have to turn their backs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is the little nobles below. Now they really don't have much money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, they were overwhelmed by successive war taxes. Many minor nobles are heavily in debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expropriation continues, the big nobles may not have much impact, and the bottom small nobles will go bankrupt collectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the king, the many small and medium nobles below are an important part of checking and balancing the big nobles and balancing the domestic situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a large number of small nobles go bankrupt, a new round of land mergers is bound to start. The final result is: the small nobles are gradually eliminated, the big nobles become stronger and stronger, and finally the royal power is reduced to a display.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar negative cases have not appeared in the continent of Aslant. Even now there are countries that are in the era of oligopoly controlled by a few big nobles.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Crown Prince Caesar came to Bloodmoon Castle in person to practice for the nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Caesar III also tried his best to pave the way for his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, after the end of the war, the celebration banquet should be held in the palace, but this time it was directly changed to the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally said: In order to commemorate the officers and soldiers who died in battle. In fact, everyone knows very well that it is nothing more than creating more opportunities for Crown Prince Caesar to appear on the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emotions are always communicated. The more contacts you make, the more you will always meet like-minded friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince, as long as he wants to win people's hearts, he doesn't have to worry about no one going to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the performance of Crown Prince Caesar is actually not bad. Apart from suffering a big loss in the last expedition to the Principality of Moxi, he did not do anything that angered people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have a problem with someone in your heart, you will greet him with a warm smile on your face. Being able to \"hide\" the true inner thoughts well is also an essential element for a king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Crown Prince Caesar who was constantly shuttling through the crowd, Hudson gave way to the stage tacitly, stepped aside in a low-key manner and let him perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, with the entry of the five dukes of New Northland, the atmosphere quickly changed. Hudson, who was supposed to come out to smooth things over to ease the atmosphere, disappeared in the venue long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles of the kingdom are not too serious to watch the excitement, as if they are waiting for a conflict between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of nobles who are close to the royal family can only worry about it on the sidelines. This is a test unique to Crown Prince Caesar, and the help of others will only help more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Torsten, Rodriguez, Angel, Pedro, Hiro haven't seen each other for a long time, how are you doing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it was intentional or a coincidence. When Crown Prince Caesar called the five Dukes of the North, he deliberately disrupted their order of appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are both in the same political group, and they also have internal rankings. Whose speech is weighty and whose speech is light can be seen from the simple order of appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of tacit understanding is left by the previous generation. Now that the older generation of people in power has passed away, the new generation has obviously not adapted to the original rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the five major families in the Northland are equally powerful. The internal ranking has never been fixed. Basically, whoever is in power is more capable and has higher prestige, the greater the right to speak in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly inconspicuous title of Crown Prince Caesar is actually full of discord. The only problem is that the means are too immature, and people can see the purpose at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Your Royal Highness, for your concern. The few of us are having a bad time these days!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero responded angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    100% truth, their few recent days were really hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden death of the older generation, the internal problems were not arranged at all, and their heirs were pushed to the shelves and pushed to the top by force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internally, they couldn't convince the public, and their parents left a lot of problems waiting for them to deal with; external troubles were even bigger, and the hostility of the kingdom's nobles kept the five of them awake at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of complicated situation has never happened in the history of the northern aristocracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, even if there was a change of power, there were no five families rushing together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a change, it is only a turmoil in one family, and the help of allies can completely stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave all rushed together, and all the allies who hugged each other to keep warm were all overwhelmed at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are the leaders of the five families in trouble, but most of the small and medium nobles who depend on them have also had successor changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the boss has died because of reselling military supplies, how can the younger brother who follows the boss be alone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's luck not to be caught by the investigation team. Once you are found out, then wipe your neck yourself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire power group has experienced serious internal turmoil, which is also the core reason why the northern nobles did not jump out to **** the spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to show up publicly after the dust settles, not only to sell everyone well, but also to sell everyone badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can't help sympathizing with the weak. As a member of the noble camp, the more pitiful and helpless the northern nobles are now, the more they can arouse everyone's sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of sympathy is worthless in front of interests, but when it does not involve self-interest, it is another situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make the image of \"poor and helpless\" more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, now he does not hesitate to touch the crown prince Caesar, deliberately portraying a poor aristocrat who was suppressed by the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, that's really too bad! But my brother Hero, I believe this little trouble will not trouble you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he also discovered the schemes of the northern nobles. He simply acted with him, and just told everyone directly: They have a deep brotherly love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides are dramatists, and the exciting meeting made Hudson roll his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that nobles are really precocious. He is obviously only in his teens or twenties, but he has the mentality of an old fox in his fifties or sixties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they grow up in this state, it is estimated that after twenty years, these guys will be old foxes in the political arena again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for now, the show is so violent that it has been seen through by all the old guys. It is estimated that among the younger generation, some politically incomprehensible people will be fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems. As long as the northern nobles stay in their fiefs and do nothing, no one can do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how turbulent the interior is, the strong military strength will still be there. Normal people will not be interested in their tough bones, nothing more than losing their right to speak in politics for a period of time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After today, Hudson's coaching position will be over. Without the identity of the coach, he is just an ordinary earl of a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a new great noble, at this time, it is necessary to keep a low profile. If you are too active, you will be easily beaten by society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the kingdom's cake has been enlarged this time, and his rise only impacted the status of the Dalton family, and did not touch the interests of other nobles in the kingdom. Otherwise, Hudson's small life would definitely not be so comfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Today we all witnessed the unity of the Kingdom, in the days to come, we will work together to create a great Alpha Kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now please, His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Caesar, read to you the list of heroes in this war, as well as the changes of titles and fiefdoms...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the drama come to an end, Hudson also appeared in the banquet center. All the rewards for military exploits have been determined early on, and even the notifications have been distributed to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, making such a move is purely Hudson's campaign for Crown Prince Caesar, or in other words, reciprocating the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming the fiery eyes of everyone, Crown Prince Caesar walked slowly to the middle and small halls of the venue, and read aloud: \"With the joint efforts of everyone, after untold hardships, we have finally expelled the evil orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to demonstrate the fairness and justice of the kingdom and the clear rewards and punishments, the great Caesar III decided to reward meritorious ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After everyone agrees, the first person to contribute in this war is the commander-in-chief of the army—Earl Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Expedition to the Principality of Moxi, save the allies in the fire and water; accept orders in the face of danger, quell the disaster of the rioters, and save the safety of the southern provinces; rescue the northern provinces to turn the tide...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Earl of Hudson canonized as the Earl of Wright County, and the fiefdoms are Dardir City, Xueyue City, Time Town, and Teren Cos Town...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"All political moves that cannot be understood have a price tag behind the scenes.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    —Hudson Quotations\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of fifty-six fiefdoms is the reward Hudson received. Although the area is very small and the distribution is still somewhat scattered, Kesheng's fiefdoms are all in the southeastern province with fertile land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the territory simply, the fifty-six fiefdoms add up to a total area of ​​more than 7,000 square kilometers, which belongs to the younger brother among the counties in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of product resources, there is absolutely no difference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the envious eyes of the nobles, you can tell that Hudson's harvest is definitely rich. It is estimated that apart from the royal family, his income this time can be ranked in the top three.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for why not the most, it involves the essence of loot distribution. In addition to the obvious military exploits, an important factor must also be considered-strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also customary for powerful nobles to share a big cake as long as they don't behave too badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distribution of spoils this time can be relatively harmonious, mainly because the nobles of the Northland are out of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, according to the past practice, the northern nobles alone could take more than one-third of the cake, and it's no wonder that the rest of the people didn't grab their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the final result, Hudson discovered that there were ruthless characters among the nobles of the kingdom. The two companies whose income is higher than his are from beginning to end: they don't show their mountains and don't show their water, and they just make a fortune in silence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, the Viscount Oran also got his wish, and successfully became the earl of the fief, but the price he paid behind the scenes was a bit high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, in exchange for this canonization, the Holliser family gave up many fiefdoms in the southeastern province. In the process of public relations, more money and favors are spread out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, if you don't pay now, even if you want to pay in the future, there will be no such opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of the mid-level nobles who crossed the threshold did not pay the price. As the only exception, Hudson's rise has no reference value at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One step at a time, after several generations of accumulation, waiting for an opportunity to explode is the most conventional operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people succeed and some people fail. Not being able to go further is nothing, the worst thing is to watch the family decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that everyone can still sit together, eat, drink, and talk about the world, if these families that have been seriously injured in the war do not improve in the next few years, their future prospects will be slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shackles of affection are time-limited. The greater the interests involved, the weaker this binding force will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The network of contacts is extensive, and you usually do a good job in dealing with people in the world. Occasionally, relatives and old friends will help you, and the process of decline is slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship between people is bad and enemies are all over the world, they will disappear from this world soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet was over, but Hudson still couldn't relax. As the victors of this war, the Koslow family is undoubtedly one of the big winners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to Hudson, the leader of the family, who became the real earl, there are also many descendants who stand out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they didn't get what they wanted and stayed in the hinterland of the kingdom to enjoy peace, but were forced to go north to start a business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is unwilling to help out, it's really restricted by the rules of the political game, and the benefits cannot be fully exploited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of other big families have all gone to Northern Xinjiang to start businesses, and the Koslow family is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the benefits of a thriving population are highlighted. More than 20 of the children who followed Hudson in the scuffle all the way won the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the title level is not high, and he has little right to speak in the northern Xinjiang area. Fortunately, they can hug each other to keep warm, so as not to be bullied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the most outstanding children of the family in front of him, Hudson was filled with endless sadness. Fortunately, the talents cultivated through hard work are now running out to start businesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he couldn't do anything to hinder the future of the tribe. Although it is not easy to start a business outside, the victory is that there are unlimited possibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying in the family is indeed comfortable and comfortable, but the prospects for development are also limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the children of a family are greedy for ease and enjoyment, it is time to decline. Only by constantly forging ahead can we have a more brilliant future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone sit down!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are all elites of my Koslow family, being able to stand out from the crowd is enough to prove your ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have all received the canonization documents. From now on, you are the new nobles of the kingdom, and you must learn how to live as nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the specific content, you have all received training before. But what I want to tell you is: if you want to gain a foothold in the Northland, the content of the family training alone is far from enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strength, strength, strength!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world, what can really allow us to live and work is always strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules are important, but the rules are also made by the strong. While you abide by the rules and make use of them, you must always keep in mind that there are no hard and fast rules in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tomorrow I will leave with the team. Whether you can take root in the northern land in the future, only you can rely on yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation of the family is too shallow, and the help that can be provided to you is very limited. As the head of the family, I can only personally sponsor each of you with three thousand gold coins and weapons and equipment for one hundred people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much help other branches can provide you is up to you to fight for it from the elders, and I will not interfere. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's sad to think about it, the Koslow family's public account is actually empty. The industries are all owned by each branch, and the family collective industry is directly 0.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the new head of the family who just took office, there is no time to develop the family business, so that Hudson can only pay for it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, during this war, he made a huge fortune. Otherwise, he, the tragic patriarch, would not even be able to afford the entrepreneurial sponsorship for his clansmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Patriarch, please rest assured! We will not let you down!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Evola's voice fell, Hudson was a black line at one end. Don't worry, he will be a ghost if he can rest assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The others are fine. Anyway, he is completely worried about Evora, the second brother of the direct relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson wanted to keep him in the family, but the young people were full of fighting spirit, so they almost wrote \"pretentious\" on their foreheads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to be able to come out, Baron Redman personally wrote letters as a lobbyist: asking for a chance to exercise Evora.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is always easy for fathers to place high hopes on their children, especially after Hudson emerged, Baron Redman's requirements for his sons have also been raised a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in his father's view, they were all born to the same parents, and it's not much different after thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are many sons, so they can stand the toss. In the struggles within the kingdom, few people were killed. There was a problem with the tossing, and Hudson, the younger brother, was responsible for the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce follow-up troubles, Hudson deliberately chose a fief for them that was not in dispute. The only downside is that it is a little bit out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it's exercise, it's not a big deal. The left and right are the baronies, and there is still a chance to move in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at his second brother Evola in high spirits, Hudson couldn't help laughing. Next, I greeted the care from my younger brother. I don't know if he can still be so happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Very good, you must continue to maintain this fighting spirit!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it wasn't for the fact that there were more goods in the queue, there would be almost no difference from when they arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble canonization that was supposed to go to the capital to accept it has now been put on hold indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the outbreak of the war to the present, it has lasted for three full years. Even the latest batch of officers and soldiers who enlisted in the army have fought on the battlefield for more than a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can survive are the lucky ones. After suffering until now, everyone is tired and tired, and they just want to go home and rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the fiefdom issue was settled, everyone who was eager to return to their hometown rushed to their hometown as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the time when I came, going back this time is obviously smoother. Perhaps in order to ease the relationship, this time the Dalton family provided ships to the nobles in the province free of charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes brought about by the war were far-reaching. After witnessing the convenience of sea transportation, the nobles who didn't like to take the boat at first readily accepted the invitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not refuse the offer. With the start of the major disarmament, the main force has already left first, and now there are some guards around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Dalton family is playing tricks, Hudson can bear the loss of these hundreds of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is impossible. All the nobles in the province followed. If an accident happened together, Dalton would also have to be buried with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, Hudson and Earl Pierce were on the same boat. In the event of an accidental shipwreck and loss of life, Earl Pierce would definitely go to see the Lord of Dawn first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, the two were talking and laughing, which made all the nobles in the province dumbfounded. If it weren't for knowing the relationship between the two competitors, they would have thought that they were good friends who talked about everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surprise is nothing but surprise, but everyone understands the political signal released: the Dalton family and the Koslow family will not turn their faces for the time being, and don't try to fish in troubled waters to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making this gesture is entirely based on the interests of the two companies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military strength of the Dalton family has been greatly damaged, and it is taking time to recover; as an upstart, the Koslow family also needs time to digest the results of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobles is realistic. The pattern of the two side by side has taken shape and will not be changed by personal will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since everyone needs time now, the prerequisites for easing the relationship are met. Things about the future will be discussed in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to expect the two companies to benefit from the confrontation and to quietly rise to pick up the bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to go down, Quake Island in front of the shore to rest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's order came out, and a huge island loomed in front of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Show strength?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is more like seduction!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the huge island that appeared in front of him, Hudson had already started drooling. Although I don't know the exact size of the area, but it is definitely not a small island that can be used as an overseas base by the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, there is never a shortage of islands in the sea, but there are very few that are suitable for development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quake Island ahead is a treasure land. After hundreds of years of development, it is now a rare and prosperous place overseas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not as good as the one on the mainland, the unique style on the ocean is also unique. It's rare to come out, you want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's words brought Hudson back to his thoughts. No matter how good Quake Island is, it has nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the vast sea, the most indispensable thing is the island. Especially in the northern continent with many shoals and reefs in the sea, the number of islands is even more numerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this journey alone, there are no less than three digits in the size of the islands encountered. It is not occupied by humans. Apart from the small size of most of the area, the biggest reason is that it is difficult to develop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Storms and waves are all fatal factors that threaten these islands. What's more pitiful is that these islands rarely have good ports, and if they want to dock large ships, they must undergo deep reconstruction of the seabed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the previous war, it seemed that the human race opened up a sea channel without much effort, but that was the result of the joint efforts of the entire human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a faction, it is still difficult to transform a sea area. No matter how much they were willing to spend their money, they still couldn't gather a team of high-level magicians to work as coolies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, Your Excellency Governor, I have never set foot on an island when I grow up. It is a rare opportunity to see something, this kind of thing must not be missed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said frankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not deliberately pretending to be tender, it's really his first contact with the ocean. What he has seen and heard along the way has greatly improved Hudson's knowledge and strengthened his determination to develop into the ocean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know how Earl Pierce will feel about it after knowing all this. However, it is estimated that the problem will not be too big. The development of the sea requires not only a large amount of investment, but also long-term technology accumulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poor and white Koslow family, if they really get involved in maritime trade, they will not have the energy to do things on the mainland for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Dalton family, the buffer during this period is particularly important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no one can sleep well next door to a young military strongman like Hudson unless he finds him something to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by traditional concepts. In the eyes of many outsiders, the young and vigorous Hudson is an unstable factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of misunderstanding is naturally indispensable for Hudson to deliberately fuel the flames behind the scenes. I just want to tell everyone directly: I am young and can afford to gamble, if I want to play stud, I will come here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical bluff, but this is what everyone eats. In the case of not involving their own interests, no one wants to touch Hudson, a \"hedgehog\" with little meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry Earl Hudson, Quake Island will definitely not disappoint you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While chatting and laughing, the boat had already docked. Under the leadership of Earl Pierce, Hudson and a group of nobles in the province set foot on land one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he hadn't been floating on the sea for long, Hudson still felt “reliable” the moment he set foot on land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the bustling pier, everyone was envious and jealous. Obviously, this wave of the Dalton family's display of strength has been very successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the prosperity of the port, it can be seen that the income of Quake Island must be high, and this is just the tip of the iceberg exposed by the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Economic strength does not represent everything, but the economic base can often determine the superstructure. Sufficient financial resources are the guarantee of strong military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the Dalton family, as the veteran overlord of the southeastern province, is not as simple as it seems on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shuttle on the island all the way, Hudson found that Quake Island was much bigger than he expected. There are not only ports on the island, but also farmland and forests. This is a self-sufficient island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a guest, it is not good to directly ask about the area of ​​the island, but from what he has seen now, Hudson knows that there are at least tens of thousands of people living on this island, and there may even be more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson found that he seemed to have opened up a new development path, but this path was not very easy to walk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the development of the Dalton family, we can see that the nobles of the continent of Aslant have obviously extended their tentacles to the sea, but due to various reasons, the investment is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short trip to Quake Island, Hudson clearly felt the emotional changes of the fellow nobles. To his surprise, several middle-class nobles in the province did not respond, obviously familiar with all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding a suitable opportunity, Hudson walked up to Earl Oran and asked, \"Your Excellency, the Dalton family should still have quite a few islands like Quake Island, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making such a guess is entirely based on the big boat under your feet. Now the luxurious magic ship they are riding on has a load capacity of over 3,000 tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transportation volume of this level already has the capability of ocean going. It is no problem to develop some offshore islands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The number of islands controlled by the Dalton family is indeed quite a lot. Most of the islands off the coast of our southeastern province are under their control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are not many islands developed like Quake Island. Although there are a lot of farmland on the island, once a storm hits, it will disappear in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ocean storms are uncontrollable. Basically, they will come every few years. In the event of a major storm, even the port would have to be rebuilt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the strong uncertainty that although the Dalton family has been involved in the ocean for a long time, the focus of development is still on land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, I remember that your territory is not far from the sea. If you just want to get a share of the ocean trade, I guess it's not a big problem. The Dalton family will probably sell you some face now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if you want to develop into the ocean and carry out key operations, you have lost the opportunity now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to develop, the price you need to pay is far more difficult than it is for you to develop swampland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest you not to rush, anyway, you have plenty of time, you can develop the swamp first and build a solid foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, whether it is to open up the trade route of the Blackstone Mountains or open up the sea trade route, it will be much easier than it is now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Earl Oran's words, Hudson frowned. Why is this just the beginning? Everyone has seen the future development strategy of the Koslow family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is no way to do this. The swampland development plan was launched a few years ago, and now hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land have been opened up one after another, and there is no way to keep it secret from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially more than a year ago, after the Koslow family acquired a large number of refugees, almost all of these manpower were devoted to the development of the swamp, which completely exposed the strategy to the eyes of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Earl, I still have self-knowledge. The Koslow family doesn't even have a seagoing ship, so why should they compete with the Dalton family for offshore waters?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now to understand the situation, it is nothing more than the convenience of sea transportation. It's not about grabbing territory with the Dalton family, they can't deny the passage of my boat! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other noble forces, Hudson would rather the Dalton family control the offshore area of ​​​​the southeastern province. This kind of strategic center of gravity in the inland maritime area hegemony is always unavoidable with various concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as sufficient deterrence is maintained on land, the Dalton family will not dare to do things at sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced by a pure ocean power, it would not be so easy to talk about. If you disagree with others, you can directly play a naval blockade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was the blessing of the Lord of Dawn, or maybe it was a good time for sailing, the wind was smooth along the way, and there was not even a little bit of waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, when all luck was exhausted, the day before arriving at the destination, the sea suddenly changed its color.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of a sudden, there was a violent storm, and the originally calm sea also set off huge waves, beating the hull violently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson witnessed with his own eyes a soldier who was accidentally swept into the sea by waves and disappeared into the vast sea in an instant, and it was too late to rescue him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are monsters approaching on the bottom of the sea, all the strong will take action to stabilize the ship, and wait for the opportunity to kill the monsters!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An experienced captain shouted to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether they transcended their status or not, the nobles who have no sailing experience can only follow orders blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, release your aura and expel the monsters that are making trouble on the seabed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson's words fell, a miniature dragon flew out from behind him, quickly turned into a giant in the air, and then let out a crisp dragon roar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the deterrent power of the giant dragon is extraordinary. Under Long Wei's deterrence, everyone felt oppressed, as if the air was suffocating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally chaotic sea quickly returned to calm. The magical beast that was just taking advantage of the chaos to stir up waves had disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the work was done, the depressed Maxim shook his tail, then quickly shrunk his figure and returned to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The whole process takes less than a cup of tea, but the impact is huge. The soldiers who survived the catastrophe couldn't help exclaiming at this moment: \"Dragon Knight! Dragon Knight...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The faces of the nobles who were traveling together were even more beautiful. There was unbelievable shock, the joy of surviving the catastrophe, and the helplessness on the face...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really embarrassing for the nobles, the team in the southeast province is really difficult to stand up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family just showed their strength, and everyone finally accepted it. An accident made the dragon come out to show its power again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With practical actions, they strongly announced to everyone that the fourth dragon knight in the mainland is by their side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to everyone's embarrassment, Earl Pierce on the side seemed very calm. It's no secret that Hudson has become a Dragon Knight. As a potential competitor, he has long been mentally prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Knight is certainly powerful, but it is also because of this strength that the Dragon Knight cannot easily make a move, and its more role is strategic deterrence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the episode, peace quickly returned to the ship. The only difference is Maxim's wonderful appearance, which added a lot of talk for everyone after dinner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the sudden appearance of the monster in the water, no one took it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countless creatures living in the vast sea. The number of monsters in the sea is no less than that of the Slant Continent. It can only be regarded as bad luck for everyone to encounter them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have been floating in the sea for a long time will inevitably deal with monsters in the sea. Most of the time, everyone is fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the ship, which is a lump of wood and iron, is not within the scope of the recipe of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Fortunately, this kind of emotional outpouring was quickly restrained by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a prince, no extra affection is allowed. Even if it is just nostalgia for \"home\", it must be restrained, otherwise it will become a \"short board\" exposed to the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"came back?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"came back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dialogue between father and son is so simple and unpretentious. All emotional exchanges are contained in these simple three words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Baron Redman has aged a lot. A lot of gray hair has been added on the top of the head, but the mental state is very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only has to worry about his son who is fighting far away, but also worry about the development of the mountain territory. It can be said that in the past two years or so, he has not had a few days of comfortable life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The happiest time is undoubtedly when the good news comes from the front line. For a father, watching his son continue to succeed is the greatest spiritual comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just come back, you'd better take over the affairs of the mountain leader yourself, I'm about to die of worry!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he always thought that he could not ride the wind, mainly because of bad luck and not high enough background. After taking over the affairs of the Mountain Territory, he quickly shattered Redman's fantasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a vassal and governing a small town are two completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson established a system in advance, he just acted according to the established rules, which still made Baron Redman tired of coping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the assistant left behind by Hudson, it is a pity that Redman cannot be trusted at all. In fact, for those guys of unknown origin, Hudson defined them at the beginning as transition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this sudden war, these guys should have been replaced one after another in the past two or three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no time to change, then you can only make do with it. As the acting lord, Redman had to watch more in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by his own abilities, Baron Redman has had a hard time in the past two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A burst of laughter concealed Hudson's inner embarrassment. Throwing the territory to Baron Redman is indeed a bit of a rush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, who can let him completely trust the person, that is, Baron Redman?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were someone else who took charge of the mountain lordship for more than two years, God knows what would happen. Hudson doesn't want to come back and clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that his choice is very correct. Baron Redman is a little tired, but the Mountain Territory has been operating normally until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reunited after a long absence, Hudson is pleasing to the eye in everything, including a few cheap brothers. Of course, the unsightly Lysul did not appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The better off Hudson is, the harder life will be for that hapless boy. Now it has developed to the stage where no one dares to return home. The baroness is afraid that Hudson will do something to him, so she sent Lesoul out of the southeastern province early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be done very covertly, but in fact, it has not escaped Hudson's eyes from beginning to end. It wasn't that he paid attention deliberately, but the person in charge of the **** mission actively reported relevant information to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the benefit of power, no need to do anything, someone will take the initiative to send the information up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson wants to shoot him, it only needs a hint, and someone will immediately make an accident for Lesser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, at first he wanted to use Laisul as a window dressing to prove his ability to accommodate people. Just looking at Baron Redman's face, he finally chose to let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, things like facades are not easy to support. Once this kind of tainted chess piece is pushed out, after the value of possession is lost, it is doomed to a miserable end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After greeting everyone symbolically, Hudson led the team directly and continued on the way home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the changed mountain collar, Hudson was delighted, but at the same time worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few years, the mountain leaders have desperately smelted steel, and the price they paid was the devastation of the environment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The billowing smoke and the bare hills are the price of the rapid development of the mountainous areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to destroy the environment, but it is difficult to control the environment. Even in the extraordinary world, it would take a considerable price to restore the original ecology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But compared with the harvest, everything is worth it. Looking at the changes in the mountain territory, we can see that the wide road is enough to accommodate four carriages, and the road extends all the way to the lord's mansion on the top of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it was just a rudimentary castle, but now it has become a city. Although there are still some buildings, they are still under construction; the streets in the buildable area have shown some signs of prosperity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The new fertile land is in the millions of acres. Even with the most traditional rotation system, the food self-sufficiency of the territory has soared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All these changes occurred during the war. With the end of the war and the normalization of the economy, the development of the mountainous territory will be even faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let go when you say let go, as if throwing a hot potato. Hudson had just settled down, and Baron Redman couldn't wait to leave a bunch of affairs to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson wanted to discuss with him and ask him his thoughts on the future development of the territory, but he never expected Baron Redman to directly say: I have no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from his eyes that Baron Redman really has no idea, not a so-called routine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the incomplete aristocratic education of the Koslow family directly constrained the thinking of the previous generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governing a small town, they have rich experience. But it would be too embarrassing to plan the future development of an earldom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rise of Hudson, the biggest dream of the Koslow family was to return to the ranks of middle-class nobles. It is unthinkable to become a great noble in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson get to where he is today, Baron Redman's only thought now is—lay flat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All life goals have been fulfilled by his son, so there is really no need to continue to struggle. Rather than being busy all day long, it is better to enjoy life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the only thing he can miss is Zudi. However, since Hudson is too capable, this thorny issue was handed over to Hudson, the new patriarch, early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson's patriarchal position does not conform to the traditional inheritance etiquette. Whether it is from the perspective of bloodlines or clan seniority, it is not Hudson's turn to be in charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All branches agreed that the person who regained the ancestral land would be the patriarch, and Hudson was not able to complete it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason for being promoted by everyone is due to the interests of the clan. Only the Koslow family, which is twisted together, can go further in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, the branches were ready to compromise, but it was a bit embarrassing. It dragged on until Hudson stepped into the ranks of the great nobles, and everyone couldn't help it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the background of the Koslow family is shallow. If the various branches don't seize the time to unite together, how can they support the lintel of the great noble family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that the beneficiary of this class leap is not Hudson alone, but all members of the entire Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking this step, everyone becomes the children of the great nobles. Regardless of how far this relationship is, with such a background, the ceiling of everyone's development potential has been greatly raised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, any member of the Koslow family who enters the officialdom may become a minister in the court; if he enters the army, he may also have the opportunity to become a commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a privilege exclusive to the great nobles. All the high-ranking members of the kingdom are either descendants of the royal family, or they were born in the families of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle and lower class nobles, no matter how well they are in the court, they can't be the chief official. Even the king cannot break the unspoken rules of officialdom and forcibly promote him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar grade divisions are also reflected in all aspects. In the continent of Aslante, the more noble one was born, the better off one would be. In front of birth, ability has become a secondary factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Common interests break all constraints. The original patriarchal succession rules have also changed due to the appearance of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the various documents piled up in front of him, Hudson felt his scalp go numb. Obviously, these are specific matters that the territory has accumulated over a long period of time and needs to be handled or understood by him personally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, notify the management of the territory to come to a meeting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he threw something in front of him, he excused himself from feeling unwell. Facing his own father's wayward performance, Hudson was powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person in charge has left. If you want to know the details of the major events that happened in the territory in the past, you can only find the management of the territory to find out the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaintly, Hudson found that Baron Redman seemed to be implying him: the people in the management who cannot be sure of their loyalty need to be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing must be done beautifully. In any case, these people have made outstanding contributions to the development of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking people down without any evidence of their betrayal can easily cause panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beda City, Earl Pierce, who stepped into the city lord's mansion, decisively stopped the celebration banquet. There are no important guests, and continuing to hold the banquet will only waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just walked down from the battlefield, and fought wits and courage with a group of provincial nobles along the way, Earl Pierce, who was physically and mentally exhausted, just wanted to have a good sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reviewing his performance in this war, he couldn't help but want to give himself two slaps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he released the dragon of Hudson and cultivated an opponent for himself; then he defeated the family's painstakingly accumulated foundation, and incidentally offended all the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before recovering his vitality, he stepped on the pit of reselling military supplies, and almost lost his own life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Connecting all these scenes together, Earl Pierce found helplessly that the situation was deteriorating all the way, and he was purely doing evil on his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson soared into the sky, and even the upstart Koslow family couldn't suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wanted to take restrictive measures, he didn't know where to start. After all, the most important strategy of the Koslow family at present is to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is nestled in the territory and buried in farming, and if they want to target the layout, they don't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the northern aristocrats who were outsiders, the nobles below spontaneously blocked them after only one round of fueling the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a family that has been rooted in the southeast province for many years, the Koslow family is still their own in the eyes of the nobles of the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of too many mouths, he is related to many nobles in the province by marriage. With these relationships as bonds, no one would be foolish to tear them apart easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when he was in trouble before, Hudson really helped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it's taking care of you when arranging errands, or helping to purchase supplies to fill in holes later, it really makes everyone feel the importance of having a good relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the frequency of marriages between nobles in the same province of the Koslow family will continue to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are things that the Dalton family cannot emulate. After all, monogamy is prevalent in the Alpha Kingdom, and if you want to have a large number of marriages, you must have more children first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if he has many heirs, it is impossible for Earl Pierce to wantonly marry the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family did this because they hadn't really integrated into the circle of great aristocrats. Except for Hudson himself, the other children of the Koslow family are still out of everyone's eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The existing circle of contacts determines that the Koslow family is now the most suitable for marriage with these small and medium-sized nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family is a veteran aristocrat, and their relationship network level is obviously much higher than that of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political marriages of the younger generations are naturally carried out in the circle of the great nobles. It is impossible to lower your status and run to compete with the Koslow family for the small and medium nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at his son and nephew in front of him, Earl Pierce could only comfort himself: the competition among nobles is not only based on quantity, but also on quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said unceremoniously that these two people in front of them can beat all the children of the Koslow family except for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is changing a bit quickly. The rapid rise of the Koslow family has already affected the family's status in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this impact is long-term, and it will not have much impact on us in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that I made a wrong judgment on the battlefield before, which brought a lot of meaningless casualties to the family and offended a lot of provincial nobles. You have to learn from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In future competitions, if the Koslow family faces each other, military measures should be avoided as much as possible. Since his debut, Hudson has gone through countless battles, no matter what kind of enemy he encounters, he has never lost a single one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of ability to use troops to fight, I am afraid that there are few comparable in the whole continent. Now that he has become the fourth dragon knight in the mainland, it is even more difficult to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this kind of enemy, unless he can be killed with a single stick, it is best to pull him into the circle of rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle between the great nobles has always been long-term, and there is no need to care about temporary gains and losses. You must correct your mentality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is strong because of Hudson, and it will also decline because of him. The individual is too strong, and everyone lives in his shadow, which will inevitably affect the growth of other members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to fight Hudson directly, just wait for him to make mistakes. Generally speaking, this kind of nouveau riche will not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't wait, then spend time with him. As long as you live longer than Hudson, you can see the decline of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't survive him, then let your son continue to suffer. This is a competition of patience, whoever persists longer will win the final victory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce was powerless to say such cowardly words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young people are inevitably angry. If you don't give psychological counseling in advance, if your younger generation is provoked by others and runs to confront Hudson, it will be easy to suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called forbearance is pure nonsense. If there is a conflict of core interests, every minute is the rhythm of turning faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no conflict of core interests, and everyone is not crazy, how can the two big forces have conflicts for no reason?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A neighbor is never a reason to become an enemy. The only thing that can really turn the two big families into enemies is hatred and interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Between the Koslow family and the Dalton family, it is obviously not up to that point. First of all, there is no deep hatred between the two, and secondly, the conflict of interests between the two parties has not yet intensified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that everyone can wait first, wait until the opponent makes a mistake, and then wait for the opportunity to make up the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, don't worry! We won't do things we are not sure about.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo replied cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the truth. He has been beaten by the society, but now he really can't bring up the courage to face Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce nodded slightly. As long as the nephew doesn't do anything, basically nothing will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for his own son, he is still a brat at the moment, and he can't even get out of Beda City. He won't have any contact with the Koslow family at all, so it's hard to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Both of you, prepare well, my flame lion is about to give birth. Although it is not as good as Hudson's dragon and earth bear, it is also a rare high-quality mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can complete the contract with the cubs, it will definitely be of great help to your future development! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Pierce still couldn't help showing envy and jealousy. Regarding Hudson's relationship with Warcraft, he really doesn't know how to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the votes are cast, the double monthly pass cannot be missed. Those readers whose monthly tickets have expired, Haiyue's heart aches!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But judging from the current situation, the final result may be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words came to his lips, but Earl Francis couldn't say anything. As one of the top families in the mainland, such a grand event naturally cannot do without the Alpha royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the right to speak is ultimately equal to strength. The third kingdom on the mainland was the Alpha Kingdom before the war. The current Alpha Kingdom obviously does not have the strength to participate in the competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after being excluded from the spoils division, the Alpha Kingdom lost its right to speak on the prairie. The royal family's participation in the battle for the big position is more like trying to make up the numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, I see. I didn't have much hope, and there is nothing to be disappointed about failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building a country is not that simple. Regardless of the fact that everyone seems to support the Seven Kingdoms on the Grassland, the situation will change once the Seven Kingdoms are established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats who went north this time were only the second sons of their families, and it was impossible for them to devote their entire family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the necessary human, material and financial resources in the early stage, the subsequent development depends on themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the seven steppe countries will not be a threat to us in the next hundred years. The meaning of their existence is nothing more than blocking the kingdom's northward expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All countries in the mainland are facing various restrictions, how can the kingdom be an exception?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good to be checked and balanced by others, so as not to have foreign enemies, everyone will know about internal fighting all day long! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decline of the orc empire brought not only benefits to the Alpha Kingdom, but also a series of troubles. One of the biggest troubles is that the kingdom is no longer united as it used to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no life-and-death crisis, and it is too embarrassing for the nobles of the kingdom to be united.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in a short period of time, everyone can still be restrained by habits and tacitly suppress internal fighting. But as time goes by, someone will eventually break this tacit understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with external enemies, internal fighting is often the scariest. Once the internal fighting mode is turned on, the national power of the Alpha Kingdom will be greatly weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are able to maintain peace because we have just gone through a big war, and everyone is tired and tired, and has no energy to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone comes out of the weak state, it will be another scene. The situation will gradually stabilize in the region only after everyone has had a chaotic fight, completed the internal reshuffle, and found a new balance point again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a juncture, Caesar III still had problems with his body, and there was a high probability that he would not be able to sustain a new round of balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the major disarmament work has been fully completed, and it is time to change the construction of the standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs believes that in view of the changes in the international situation, the original construction idea of ​​the Kingdom's standing army: easy to replenish and high consumption, can no longer meet the current needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the threat of orcs, the kingdom's military pressure has become routine. Following the example of the countries on the mainland to establish a small but elite high-combat force is more in line with our current needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war against the orcs is the best example. The combat effectiveness of the elite troops brought out by all parties in the Terran Alliance is far beyond that of the normal army of the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those extraordinary troops, the fighting power displayed is even more dazzling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom can have troops similar to a ground dragon army, a tyrannosaurus rex army... even the Beamon army can easily deal with it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Effiero suggested carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after witnessing the strength of the Warcraft Legion, can we know why the top forces in the mainland are working hard to develop extraordinary troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom was unique before, but it was forced to do nothing by the orcs. We can only find ways to improve our combat effectiveness in the shortest possible time, and we cannot consider long-term development at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the passage of time, the popularity of the Warcraft Legion is also the general trend. At present, the biggest problem restricting the expansion of extraordinary armies in various countries is: insufficient number of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this problem can be solved with time. In peaceful times, the number of artificially cultivated monsters must be on the rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who knows mathematics knows that the difficulty of going from one hundred to one thousand is no less difficult than going from one thousand to ten thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the expansion of the breeding scale and the advancement of breeding technology, the raising cost of the Warcraft Legion in the future is expected to be further reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Warcraft Legion is widely popularized in various countries, if the Alpha Kingdom does not follow up, it will definitely be eliminated by the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, the investment in this area must be increased. I will send someone to discuss with Earl Hudson and borrow his dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But seeds alone are not enough, and the female animals for breeding must also be carefully selected. It is best to use Warcraft, especially Yalong beast with strong fertility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of cultivating monsters, the Franks are at the forefront of the mainland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their Tyrannosaurus Rex Legion and Pterosaur Legion are not only powerful in combat, but also relatively docile in temperament. It is said that even if you don't sign a contract, you can still be ridden by someone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said enviously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a monarch, how could he not have the dream of being the overlord? Unfortunately, the strength of the Alpha Kingdom cannot support this dream. He can only hide his thoughts deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many things that cannot be envied. The Tyrannosaurus rex legion of the Franks was not cultivated in a day or two, but the best species selected after many times of crossbreeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the sub-dragons are not high-level, most of them are low-level monsters of the second and third tiers. Only a few outstanding tyrannosaurus rex can become mid-level monsters, which are also big killers on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (Remarks: Levels 1 to 9 of monsters correspond to the nine levels of human beings. One, two, three low-level monsters, four-five-six middle-level monsters, seven-eight-nine high-level monsters)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this year's budget has been set. Military expenditures have long been overrun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, Earl Hudson proposed to strengthen the construction of magic crossbow and magic crystal cannon troops, and you also approved it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Finance did not even make up for this part of the expenses. The construction of the Warcraft Legion cannot be completed overnight, so it is better to postpone it first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado persuaded with a bitter face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, everyone was celebrating the victory, except the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance were worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy financial pressure weighed down the kingdom's finances. However, Caesar III is also a promising lord, such a lord is usually more able to toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earlier, Hudson proposed to strengthen the construction of magic crossbow and magic crystal cannon troops. Caesar III felt that it was necessary to do so. Now the Ministry of Military Affairs proposes to build the Warcraft Legion, and he thinks it is good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is only military. In other fields, when encountering good suggestions, Caesar III also wants to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedy is that as long as you want to do something, you will inevitably spend money. However, what the Alpha Kingdom lacks most now is money, so that Marquis Delgado, as the Minister of Finance, can only interrupt the king's plan constantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    wanted to say something, but after seeing Marquis Delgado's bald head, Caesar III didn't know how to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being silent for a while, Caesar III sighed helplessly, and then said: \"First select a high-quality female animal and try it on a small scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the scale is controlled, it should not cost much. After the finances improve, large-scale breeding will be carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a long-term project, and the Ministry of Military Affairs still needs to pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the big nobles in the country will follow suit, and they can cooperate with them when necessary to reduce the cost of breeding. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III had no choice but to make such a decision. He would also like to be able to monopolize, but it's a pity that the dragon is no longer in his hands!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon's nature is obscene, coupled with special aesthetic taste, as long as a bunch of female animals are sent there during the estrus season, breeding is basically a no-brainer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if all these actions want to go smoothly, the cooperation of Hudson, the dragon knight, is indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't understand the dragon's temperament and the specific estrus time, if you send the female beast at the wrong time, you are giving rations to the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the dragon aesthetic is online most of the time. The only ones who can catch their eyes are dragon beauties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in the estrus season, their aesthetics will be open, and almost all female beasts will become beautiful girls in an instant in their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson is busy arranging people to take over the fief. All of a sudden, there are a lot of scattered fiefdoms, and the pressure on the management of the territories is undoubtedly huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, after several years of precipitation, Hudson has also accumulated some teams, who can barely take over the territory and maintain the normal operation of various places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary small town is actually easy to rule. The original nobles had no heirs, no legal bloodlines, and the remaining servants and serfs simply couldn't think of doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traditional agricultural production, as long as the people sent there don't mess around, everything will continue to operate as usual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is city management. In addition to the necessary deterrence of force, certain management skills are also required. Those with rich management experience are treasures everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson wanted to retain some officials, but when he took over the fief, he was surprised to find that all the people had run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether he was poached or fled with the money, Hudson didn't have the time to pursue it. Anyway, what was left to him was a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is Dardir City or Xueyue City, there is no order now. In name it was reception, but in fact it was more like an armed occupation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the blood-stained street in front of him, Hudson was full of anger. There are ruffians and hooligans who dare to domineering on his territory, it is simply tiresome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no tenderness. Anyone who has done things in the city is either killed on the spot because of resistance, or becomes a glorious life-long \"miner\", or the kind that does not need to pay a salary of one copper coin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revisiting the old place, looking at the suppressed Dadier City, Hudson suddenly has a sense of history repeating itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if this important town in the south of the province has been cursed. The past few years have always been full of disasters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he was slaughtered in the Skull and Bones rebellion, and after finally regaining some vitality, the unlucky sheriff of Sith suddenly ran away again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The left-behind managers were able to hold their ground at the beginning, but after losing the deterrence of force for a long time, the unstable elements in the city quickly revealed their true colors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that it was not his own territory, so Hudson would naturally not be troublesome. Now that it has become my own territory, I can't let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as I took action, I almost bleed. It is enough to prove how miserable the people living in Dadir City are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing and tossing one after another, it is estimated that the aborigines who used to live in Dardir City are almost extinct at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luke, if Dadir City is handed over to you to manage, what will you do next?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a test, but it is actually the beginning of the adjustment of the management of the territory. Theoretically speaking, from the person in charge of land reclamation to the manager of a city, he must have been promoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, opening up wasteland is the core strategy of the Earldom. No matter how important Dadir City is, no matter how superior its geographical conditions are, it cannot conceal the fact that it is far away from the administrative center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relocation of the administrative center, Hudson also considered. It's a pity that the counties' fiefdoms are too fragmented. Whether they move to Dadir City or Xueyue City, they are surrounded by other people's territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the safe rear, move the government office to the front line bordering all forces. If it weren't for the water getting into the brain, they would not be able to do such a stupid thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the remoteness of the territory, the traffic congestion, and the problems that are not conducive to economic development, they are worthless in the face of strategic security.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to move, it will be relocated in the middle of the swamp plain after the swamp is developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, according to the traditional habits of the Aslante continent, the probability of the Lord's Mansion staying in place is much higher than relocating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on the highest \"mountain\" in the southeast province, surrounded by \"mountains\", it is a strategically dangerous place!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least compared to Yimapingchuan's southeastern province, the location of the Hudson Lord's Mansion is a natural danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, I really haven't thought about this issue. However, with the superior geographical location of Dardir City, as long as the social order is restored, it will not worry about development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem now is confidence. The continuous turmoil has caused the people to lose confidence in Dadir City. The residents who stay in the city now are the masters who want to run, but have nowhere to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to restore the city's economy, the best option is to restore the confidence of the residents in the city, restore the confidence of the businessmen, and then relocate some people. Basically, it's almost the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want quick results, it is best to move the Lord's Mansion here. With your credit, sir, confidence will soon be restored. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Luke's words, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly. I still haven't thought about it, it's clear that I have prepared the manuscript in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be very difficult if you could catch the ducks on the shelves temporarily and be able to clear your mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Geniuses who can come up with a perfect strategy at a glance may exist in this world, but Luke in front of him is obviously not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really had that ability, he would be a guest wherever he went, and it would be impossible for him to be so downcast that he went to Hudson, who was not a nobleman at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is understandable to prepare in advance. Along the way, Hudson expressed his intention to \"reuse\" him more than once, and he can roughly guess the score.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is impossible to relocate the lord's mansion, but your other proposals are quite pertinent. Next, Dadir City will be handed over to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know me, you never care about the process, I only want the final result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time limit is three years. I want to see a prosperous Dadir city that can generate a lot of tax revenue. This is what I ask of you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the following days, Hudson used various excuses to transfer posts to the management who could not determine their loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce internal disputes, all these personnel adjustments have been covered with a \"reuse halo\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as those who were loyal to their duties during their tenure were promoted one after another, they took on more \"important\" responsibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about Hudson, I feel speechless. Many guys with unknown origins and suspected spies even performed better than many \"insiders\" during their tenure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that apart from the lack of loyalty, it is a proper and excellent worker. So much so that when he wanted to do the cleaning, Hudson couldn't bear to do it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make the best use of their talents, this large-scale personnel adjustment is mainly based on external transfers, and most of them are arranged to manage the newly acquired territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all enclaves, as long as they can provide taxes, labor and supplies to the lord's mansion stably, Hudson doesn't have too many ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well run it is, these enclaves are temporary territories. In the future, we still have to find a way to gather together, but this time period may be a bit long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest stumbling block is the unspoken rules of the kingdom. To change territories, not only the lord involved must agree, but also the king and the noble council must agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If any link is stuck, the territory replacement cannot proceed. The existence of this rule is mainly to protect the interests of the small and medium nobles and prevent the big nobles from bullying others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As in Hudson, which involves the adjustment of dozens of enclaves, the relationship between the parties that needs to be coordinated is even more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if the lord himself is settled, it will be rejected 100% in the hands of the king and the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To achieve the goal, a series of coordination is indispensable. Maybe it will be replaced in batches to reduce the resulting impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of fiefdoms, nearly 7,000 square kilometers of land, the most valuable wealth brought to Hudson, apart from the land itself, is the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province has a superior geographical location, fertile land, dense population, and is far away from the frontline battlefield, so it is relatively less affected by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the data collected from various places, the total population of the new territory is 150,000, which is larger than the total population under Hudson's original rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the development of the prairie, almost all major forces are immigrating, causing unprecedented tension in human resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally prosperous slave trade has now stagnated. Even if someone sold slaves, they were wiped out by the major forces secretly manipulating the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, human resources are even more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the data in his hand, Hudson secretly rejoiced that he was not greedy for too much, and wanted to go to the north to develop in one step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how big the land area is, if no one is going to develop it, what's the use of holding it in your hands?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts once again prove that rapid development still depends on war. Without this war, it would be difficult for the mountain leaders to even have a population of 40,000 to 50,000 if they only rely on their own efforts to farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after a war, the situation changed completely. The gathered refugees, together with the population of the newly added fief, are about to break through the 300,000 mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the great nobles in the kingdom, this population is still at the bottom, but Hudson is still satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people as the foundation, many plans that could only be thought of before can now be slowly implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to action, Hudson still chose to play it safe first. While the large increase in population brings dividends, it also brings many new problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem is the difficulty of management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The managers in the territory wantonly released, in addition to worrying about their loyalty, they also want to use their abilities to bring these enclaves under control in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spy is not a spy, frankly Hudson is not very worried. As long as these people are not allowed to enter the core management, the damage will be very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the spies placed at a high price are mainly for monitoring and delivering information, and they will not be exposed unless it is absolutely necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the spies placed by some middle-class nobles, at the moment they are even more hiding, lest they expose their identities and get burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are no problems with Hudson himself, most of the spies mixed in the territory will be very peaceful. Except for passing on information occasionally, he can only act as a worker honestly in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some trivial matters, if you should pretend to be confused, you should pretend to be confused. If at a critical moment, some false information is deliberately released, it may be able to play an unexpected role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No big moves, but little moves. In addition to personnel adjustments, he also made some minor adjustments to the territory's industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Riha, from now on, the military production in the territory will gradually shift to civilian industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to retaining the necessary military production capacity, the remaining production capacity must be turned to the production of agricultural tools, pots and pans for daily necessities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the next one or two years, there should be a wave of market prices for agricultural tools and daily necessities, but the military industry in various places will undergo transformation, and the competition may be relatively high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production capacity of iron and steel smelting will also be gradually reduced in the next two years, and only 60% of the current capacity can be retained. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This decision was not the result of Hudson slapping his head, but the result of the think tank's speculation after analyzing historical experience data.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battles are over, everyone has a large backlog of weapons and equipment, and the arms market is bound to be bleak in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the hugely profitable arms trade, the mines and arms dealers in various places who were frantically expanding their production capacity in the past have either drastically reduced their production capacity or carried out transformation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The answer that can be seen at a glance, Hudson doesn't believe that everyone can't see it. It is conceivable that after the market fell into depression, the arms giants in the kingdom would rush into the civilian market frantically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is basically nothing to contend with in the market within the kingdom. Everyone has a tacit understanding with each other, it is right for each to toss within their own sphere of influence, and it is a bad idea to cross the border to fight a price war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big market that appeared in the north is the focus of everyone's competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there was no maritime trade, the merchants of the Alpha Kingdom would definitely be able to make a fortune. Unfortunately, the sea route to the prairie had already been opened during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing the advantage of monopoly, it is impossible to lie down and make money. Newly born countries can get support from their own backgrounds, and people won't buy products that are too expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the upcoming competition will be unprecedentedly fierce, but going to the hard bar, it is definitely out of the head. Even if he has a certain cost advantage, Hudson will not choose a price war foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main purpose of developing the steel industry is to make money, not to seize the market. He can still distinguish the difference between being the number one steel tycoon in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, do you really want to cut production capacity?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, we have received a lot of orders, especially from the big chambers of commerce. According to the current production capacity, orders may be able to be scheduled until next year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Riha asked with a puzzled mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a blacksmith to a project leader, Riha's ability and vision have long been unable to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to stay in office all the time, in addition to doing a good job in grasping production issues, the most important thing is that the ancestors have been working for the Koslow family, and their loyalty is guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"They just paid a deposit, which was still the minimum deposit. We are not the only ones who have received similar massive orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many commodities, if they are all produced, who can they sell to in the end?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the storage time of iron products is long, the maintenance cost of long-term storage is not low. Once the market capacity is exceeded, it is easy to cause market collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just wait and see, there will either be a large-scale default or a second price cut. This kind of abnormal high-priced purchase is destined to be impossible to continue for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Riha, the people in the sales department will be responsible for these problems, so you don't have to worry about them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted him to learn from him and broaden his horizons, but Rihana's full head of white hair directly dispelled Hudson's idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivating talents must also select the younger generation. This kind of master who is getting old and may retire at any time, let him go!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson faintly felt strong dissatisfaction with the major chambers of commerce. Fortunately, he still treats those guys as \"friends\", and he didn't expect to trick people, these guys don't even let \"friends\" go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that in the previous cooperation, everyone made a fortune with blood. Although a large piece of meat was taken away by Hudson, he also made great efforts in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the cooperation of Hudson, the major chambers of commerce would not be able to obtain so much huge profits no matter how well planned they are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, those guys are obviously addicted to playing. After defrauding a group of nobles in the Alpha Kingdom, now they are eyeing the arms tycoon who made a fortune in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of grassland development, deliberately create a \"huge demand\", unscrupulously spread orders in various places, just waiting for everyone to take the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the familiar routine, Hudson would have been almost fooled. After all, under normal circumstances, as long as the deposit is paid, there are very few defaults.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there was a problem, it was impossible for Hudson to jump in, but it didn't prevent him from watching a group of colleagues jump in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a competitor, it is considered ethical not to add insult to injury. It is impossible to actively remind everyone to pay attention to traps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, even if this kind of thing is reminded, people may not appreciate it. Maybe it will attract more hostility and create trouble for myself out of thin air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, Hudson accepted the order with a smile, extended the production time of the order as much as possible, and asked for a deposit by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business default has never been a problem. As long as the production speed is slow enough, he has the ability to dispose of the produced goods even if there is a default time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even more perfect if he could hit his competitors by the way. After all, the steel industry is an asset-heavy industry, which is a test of the strength of capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that there is no production without money. Anyway, steel giants that lack capital investment will definitely be at a disadvantage in the long-term competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After years of development, human beings have actually reached the threshold of the industrial revolution. It's just that the eruption of science and technology is different from the ordinary steam engine revolution, and more like the magic industrial revolution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, with the special political system of the Aslante continent, the most effective means to break out the industrial revolution is war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conservative nobles are willing to spend money on research and development of only one project - the military. Any scientific research results that can improve military strength are always the easiest to transform into results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the magic crossbow that shined in this war will enjoy a wave of development dividends next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he thought he could not compete with the major forces in scientific research capabilities, Hudson encouraged Caesar III to concentrate the power of the kingdom to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect can't be seen for the time being. Anyway, the Kingdom's Mage Association has taken over this burden. Many alchemists with experience in making magic crossbows have joined the research and development team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The technology owned by the kingdom is not equal to the possession of the domestic nobles, but the magic crossbow products produced by the kingdom can be purchased by the domestic nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't have extravagant expectations. How advanced the magic crossbow produced by the kingdom is, as long as it can keep up with the world's first-class level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment, once everyone has it in their hands, it is equivalent to being pulled to the same level, and the final competition is the commanding ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the use of magic crossbows, Hudson is not boasting. He is the most experienced in the entire continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the magic crossbow can shine in war, and Hudson also contributed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't insisted on using the magic crossbow together, no one would have known the power of this thing after it was scaled up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the different shapes and cumbersome manufacturing techniques, these magic crossbows are essentially replicas of old-fashioned rifles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of strategic vision knows that once this kind of magic crossbow, which tests productivity, becomes popular on a large scale, it can have a profound impact on the situation on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting aside the cranky thoughts in his mind, Hudson got busy again. Originally thought that after the war was over, returning to the territory would allow him to rest for a while, but it turned out that this was purely an extravagant wish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he was busy taking over the new fiefdom, and then adjusted the management without stopping, and then happened to discover the conspiracy of those unscrupulous profiteers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing all this work, now I will start patrolling the territory again. After leaving his own territory for such a long time, if he didn't come out to check the lord's presence, accidents would easily happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, the Earl just went out to inspect the territory, why don't you come back at another time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom whispered persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is still very afraid of the woman who is suspected to be the lord's lover, and he doesn't even dare to look at her face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was Tom jealous, but as the first woman brought back by Hudson, Isabel had a special status in the entire Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hostess is out of reach, and the guests seem to have stayed too long. The only reasonable explanation that can be accepted by everyone is the status of a lover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is it such a coincidence? I just came here, and the Earl happened to be away?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on her good communication skills and her status as the lord's lover, during these days in the lord's mansion, she has been able to get along like a duck to water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that no matter who she faces, she always greets her with a polite smile, which gives everyone a good impression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past two years, it was also the happiest time for Isabel. All kinds of cultivation resources are sufficient, there is no need to intrigue, and there is no need to worry about being spied on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with Hudson's return, everything has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a prisoner, he lived a life similar to that of a hostess. That was because the Lord Hudson was not around, and everyone could not figure out the relationship between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, Isabel has always been very quiet, and she is not practicing every day, or practicing piano, chess, calligraphy, painting, singing and dancing and other eating skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just withdrawing some cultivation resources from the government, even Baron Redman didn't say anything, let alone others dare to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What can be fake is fake after all. It can deceive other people, but it can't deceive the real owner. Isabel doesn't think that Hudson's advantage is easy to take advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If he hadn't happened to meet here, he would have almost forgotten that there was such a person in his house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he has a bad memory, it's that there are too many things happening recently, and he doesn't even have the heart to think about women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I chose to keep Isabel because on the one hand, she was really valuable;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also a normal man. It is impossible to say that he has no idea when he meets a beautiful woman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just telling him rationally that the woman in front of him is fine for playing around, but if he gets really emotional, sooner or later something big will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think that his charm can be so great that a woman who grew up in Goulan can be moved by her true feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really playing with feelings, whoever plays will not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to two years ago, Isabel has changed a lot. Different from the previous frown and smile, they are full of temptation. Now Isabel has more of the extravagance of everyone's excellence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the environment can change people the most. As a well-known singer in mainland China, it is impossible for her to walk around in the circle of men every day without being contaminated by the wind and dust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a vacancy for the hostess of the territory. During the two years in the mountain territory, Isabel almost enjoyed the treatment of the hostess, and her temperament has naturally changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why, pretending to be my lover for so long, and still don't know what to do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson teased half-jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things pretend to be real, and they can become real after a long time. Regardless of the real situation, the outside world has identified the relationship between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to clean up the relationship, not even an explanation. When the whole circle is dirty, being too innocent becomes a sin instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an outstanding nobleman, it would be very embarrassing if he didn't have many lovers. Especially for someone like Hudson who became famous at a young age, he couldn't be less romantic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have a relationship with a woman, you will have a relationship with a man. Driven by jealousy, everyone has to make up jokes about him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, are you planning to settle accounts after the autumn?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was invited to the mansion by you, and at that time you acquiesced to the existence of these rumors. Comparing with a little girl like me now, I'm afraid it's not in line with your noble status. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the distance between the two has narrowed. To be precise, Hudson was advancing, and Isabel was retreating until her body leaned against the wall and there was no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whether it's true or not, it doesn't matter anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Miss Isabel is smart, I think you know what to do next. Since you have chosen to act, then you can continue acting for me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, I will settle the debts owed in the past two years, and I won't embarrass you. It's not too much to charge you ten times the fine if you don't ask for it, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, I would have only one more lover. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't continue to talk about recruiting. Today is different from the past. Although Hudson is eager for talent now, the shortage of talents is far less serious than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel is a talent, but unfortunately most of her abilities are in seducing men, followed by her talent for gathering information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When given a choice, Hudson didn't want such a stunner to intervene in intelligence matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, if he really gets along for a long time, he can't guarantee whether he can resist the temptation of beauty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this is all the information I know about the mysterious organization, including the intelligence training courses I have received.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not enough to repay the debt, then we can only do as you say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, as long as you men think, you can always find a reasonable excuse for yourself! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Isabel rolled her eyes directly, her words and deeds were full of endless temptation, and her original temperament of aristocratic lady disappeared instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You're playing with fire!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, the two of them were already stuck together. Facing the beautiful woman in his arms, Hudson couldn't bear it anymore...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too late to say this now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rising sun shines on the earth, and it is another beautiful day. Unable to resist the temptation of the beautiful woman in his arms, it was another upside-down battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the first time I experienced the joy of fish and water, and the feeling of ecstasy left Hudson with endless aftertaste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming Isabel's affectionate eyes, Hudson was so frightened that he hurriedly got up, and rationally told him to stay here to shake the clouds and rain, and his kidneys would be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No way, who made him inexperienced?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The skill of the person in front of me is rough, but after all, he has been trained, and he has all martial arts in the 18th class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who has never seen the market, has been led by the rhythm after he succeeded for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I still have something to do, let's talk tonight! If you need anything, just tell the servant.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    put on clothes, Hudson said rather awkwardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really immoral to leave after eating and cleaning up. It's just that his reason told him that it would be dangerous for him to stay here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He will not dream of having a relationship once, and the beautiful woman in front of him will fall in love with him desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at Isabel's affectionate expression, but Hudson still sensed a trace of pleasure after revenge from the depths of her eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world of the strong, it is not surprising that women are attached to men, but it does not mean that they will not take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this method of revenge is very evocative, and Hudson enjoys it very much, in the end, reason prevailed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why don't you check it out, this is your first time? It seems that you men have always cared about this the most.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provocative words made Hudson roll his eyes helplessly, and responded with a smile: \"Don't worry, I checked it a long time ago,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that I'm still a magician, and it's not difficult to release an identification technique. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more extraordinary the world, the more emphasis on bloodlines. Various identification magics also came into being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private life of the nobles is corrupt, but there are prerequisites for that. Dare to go out and mess around unscrupulously, it is usually because the family background of the couple is out of balance, or they are widowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most well-matched marriages must maintain a certain bottom line. If there was a joke about confusing the bloodlines, it would be embarrassing for both families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the great nobles, they pay special attention to these aspects. Relatively speaking, the constraints on women are stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a big joke is made, the women in the whole family will not be able to find a suitable partner to marry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After breakfast, Hudson was still worrying about the absurdity of last night. I couldn't bear to do it at first, and now I can't do it even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calmly thinking, Hudson quickly calmed down. This is the continent of Aslante, it is no longer the previous earth, and the rules of the game are no longer the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rumors of the relationship between the lovers have been circulating for so long, but the father-in-law never came to the door to ask the teacher about his crimes, which is enough to explain a lot of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the bottom line is broken, it can never be found again. When the **** is gone, there is only enjoyment left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After figuring it out, Hudson once again devoted his energy to the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that money and beauty are only accessories of the strong, as long as he is strong enough, he will not lack these.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the busy crowd ahead, Hudson first turned his attention to Bear Stearns, and then to Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This artificial canal has been under construction for three years, but the progress of the project is very impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, in the next two years, more labor was invested, but the progress was not as good as the first few months of excavation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core reason for all this is the absence of Bear Stearns. Without the coolies of the Earth Bear, the difficulty of construction in the swamp has been raised by more than one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Xiong is back, but Bear Stearns is no longer as easy to fool as he was when he was two or three years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past two years of war career, not only Hudson has grown up in the flames of war, but even Bear Stearns has made great progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson still gave up on Maxim. There is no way, this red dragon is easier to fool, but he is a fire dragon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His arson skills are top-notch, and his ability to fight and cause trouble is not bad. It would be too embarrassing for him to help dig canals and develop swamps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't let the dragon set fire to dry up the swamp, maybe even the exhausted dragon can't do it. What's more, the dry swamp has lost its value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Bear Stearns, time to work!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Begging Xiong to do things, Hudson is still very able to let go of his airs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The agreement that year was indeed somewhat unethical. The joint development of the swamp land was divided together, but the infrastructure was occupied by Hudson with despicable means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young Bear Stearns did not know the pitfalls, so he signed the agreement in a daze. Facing the agreement in black and white, the proud Earth Bear can't do anything wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, don't worry about this, I am no longer a child of two or three years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Friendship belongs to friendship, brothers have to settle accounts clearly, and the nature of our relationship is similar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't promise to help you dig the artificial river. Forget about the previous work, and the follow-up project must be renegotiated! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he shook his chubby head. Seeing that cute expression, Hudson couldn't be happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, you can't say that. You are the profit bearer of this artificial river. Think about it. With this artificial river, it will be much more convenient to irrigate the land on both sides?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a necessary auxiliary project for the development of swampland, how can you give up on it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take action, you can pay me the water bill for your pastures, fertile fields, and forests in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take a longer view, you are a bear that can live for thousands of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current project volume is only the last 180 miles. You can work hard for a year or so and it will be over, but the benefits will be thousands of years! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried hard to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this set is outdated. The cub, who is used to the routine, waved his paw unceremoniously and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't bully me, I don't know anything. I will share 30% of the canal navigation fee, and all the later management and maintenance costs will be yours!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the growth of strength and IQ, Bear Stearns, after following Hudson in the Southern and Northern Wars, the accumulation of knowledge has increased sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a glance, Hudson saw through the real purpose of excavating this artificial river, and even chose to share the freight directly instead of sharing the revenue in order to avoid being pitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The post-maintenance cost of the canal is not low, and 30% of the shipping fee is too high. Unless you also participate in the post-maintenance work, at most you will get 10% of the shipping fee!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to hesitate and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory is not on any golden road. As a canal inside the territory, it is inherently doomed not to charge high freight charges.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these words, it is impossible for Hudson to say in advance. Otherwise, with the laziness of the Earth Bear, he would be able to quit in minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Bear Stearns is already considered an alternative to the Earth Bears. There are far more Earth Bears who have signed contracts with humans, but Bear Stearns is the only one who is willing to help with work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through all the history books in my hands, the record about the earth bear is either sleeping or fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that from birth, the poor Xiongsheng was pulled away. If it weren't for the strong talent of the race, it would have been extinct long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Twenty percent, no less. If you think the price is high, you can let that stupid dragon do it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Bear Stearns' words fell, Maxim beside him exploded with anger. Originally, he was tricked into signing an unequal contract, but he was full of anger and had nowhere to vent, so this stimulation was worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the two monsters were about to fight each other, Hudson immediately stopped him and said, \"Twenty percent, just twenty percent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Mr. Bear Stearns, please respect Mr. Maxim when you speak next time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although in his mind, Maxim is also a stupid dragon. But you don't hit people in the face, and you don't expose your weaknesses when you scold the dragon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally tricking a dragon to come over, what if he gets angry and runs away?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contract signed, he, the master, did take advantage of it a little bit, but in the end, he still had to respect the dragon's body rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't had a mysterious compass that could increase the dragon's cultivation speed, Maxim might have been ruined long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, don't meddle in this matter, let me teach this little bear some rules!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Maxim had already started rubbing his paws, as if he was waiting for Hudson to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Come as soon as you come, it's not necessarily whoever teaches you a lesson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns replied without showing any weakness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him gave Hudson a headache. If a dragon and a bear really fought here, he, the lord, would definitely lose the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't think that these two guys would still care about the life and death of slaves and serfs after they fought the real fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, both of you give me peace of mind. If anyone dares to make trouble, the energy for future cultivation will be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially Maxim, don't forget that you already owe me a lot of debts. If you destroy the facilities in the territory again, do you want to sell your blood to pay off the debt?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And you, Bear Stearns, you are almost six years old, why do you still look like a one or two year old child. As a knowledgeable and civilized bear, don't think about fighting every day! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that each of them is playing 50 big rebounds, but in fact it is Hudson who is inoculating Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the giant dragon family is greedy for money, they still can't do such a bottomless thing to make money by being a dragon breeder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the operations of several other dragon knights on the mainland, we can see that the sub-dragon beasts are made after the dragon is in heat, and then the female beast is sent to the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, such things as dragons in heat mainly depend on luck. It occurs once every three to five years, and once every 180 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The duration also ranges from a few days to several months, with some exceptions it may last for several years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of the long lifespan of the dragon clan, these are not things. But for Hudson, that would be fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Maxim does not cooperate, the dragon breeding plan will not go ahead. To get there, Hudson had to be reminded repeatedly that he was a dragon with a huge debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Maxim is not poor. However, a creature like a giant dragon didn't take out the money that was in his pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is worse than killing them to expect the dragon to pay the debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most giant dragons, why should they pay back the money they owe?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are countless cases about dragon knights being cheated of money by giant dragons. Almost all dragon knights learn from their experience and lessons after being hit many times, and they no longer show gold coins in front of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can now catch the dragon and reprimand him, that is, he can provide Maxim with the energy he needs to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
