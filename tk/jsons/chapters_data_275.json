More than ten days passed in the blink of an eye. In order to urge the coalition forces to send troops, envoys from the Warhammer Kingdom came to harass them every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, Hudson's position is consistent with that of the princes and nobles of the Principality of Moxi, and they have made up their minds to wait for the reinforcements to arrive before sending troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's funny to say that, after receiving the news of the Alpha Kingdom's counterattack, the Warhammer Kingdom decided that the orcs would run away. As a result, the army led by Joseph II was defeated again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the 700,000 troops retreated all the way to the west of the kingdom, the troops following them were actually less than 50,000, another epic defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprises, Joseph II and Crown Prince Caesar, the two \"crashing dragons and phoenixes\", suddenly became the most eye-catching cubs in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army is indeed going to run, but before running away, it does not prevent them from consuming a wave of human vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just went shopping, and everyone knows that the Three Kingdoms in the North are the most determined \"beast destroyers\" among the human race. In the next big counterattack of the human race, the Three Kingdoms will definitely spend a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't take advantage of the time now to annihilate the army of the Warhammer Kingdom, the next encounter will be in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Successfully made a big ticket, but still failed to satisfy the appetite of the orcs. The army of the Warhammer Kingdom on the steel defense line is now also the meat on their chopping board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If time permits, it is estimated that they will make persistent efforts to win the western part of the Warhammer Kingdom in one fell swoop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the orc army has already moved. It's just that many places in the western mountainous area are easy to defend and difficult to attack. Marshal Borg, who went home to retire, was elected as the commander in chief by the local nobles to preside over the defense of the western provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the number of orc infantry that penetrated into the Warhammer Kingdom was limited, and they were reluctant to use cavalry to attack the city. The western mountainous area of ​​the Warhammer Kingdom, which was weak, was actually defended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Joseph II is not useless. At least in the previous battle, the orc infantry was beaten up in advance, laying the foundation for the current defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the western nobles would not appreciate it, and they didn't even welcome Joseph II with his army. More than one nobleman refused the king's access to the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by interests. In this great battle, the eastern aristocrats, who have a higher voice, deliberately arranged for the private army of the western aristocrats to cut off their rear in order to preserve their own advantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the army successfully completes the strategic transfer, with the advantage of strength in hand, the western nobles can only pinch their noses to recognize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that a big defeat ruined everything. The eastern aristocratic group that was originally superior in strength can no longer hold down the western aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this dispute between the eastern and western aristocratic groups, as the king, Joseph II seemed to remain neutral, but in fact he still preferred the eastern aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no medicine for regret in politics. If you make a wrong choice, you have to bear the price. Even the king is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army on the front line is still there, and the balance of the Warhammer Kingdom has not been completely broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as these troops are kept, the eastern nobles can still maintain their military advantage over the western nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, these reasons are completely meaningless to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal struggle between the two camps of the Warhammer Kingdom, no matter who wins or loses, will not affect his interests. There's no need to take risks for a group of unrelated people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the Moxi people, I am afraid that I wish this old neighbor would be even more miserable. The more chaos in the Warhammer Kingdom, the better for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has reached this stage, it is no longer a time for everyone to work together to fight against a powerful enemy, but more to make their own calculations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No backstabbing, that is a qualified ally. It would be too embarrassing for them to send troops to rescue them at the risk of heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the thick gift list, Hudson sighed and said, \"Tom, send someone to send the things back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell them that there is no need to send them anymore. This matter is beyond my ability and cannot be done! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a matter of principle to collect money to do things. Since the matter cannot be handled, this gift cannot be accepted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson has always been very restrained. In the Principality of Moxi these days, as long as they have given gifts, there is no one who does not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Earl! I'll arrange it right away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Tom has already exited the room. Acting vigorously and resolutely is Hudson's consistent style, which directly affects the attitude of the people below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the things that are ordered to go on are implemented as soon as possible. The bad habits of delay and prevarication have not yet appeared in the small team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dealing with a small matter, Hudson got busy again. The era of the great counter-offensive has come, and the end of the war is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xing Xing came here to fight **** battles, so it was not a waste of time. Hudson really has no shortage of money now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aside from the hundreds of thousands of gold coins and bonds given by the Mosi people, the loot is not a small sum of money, not to mention the real big head is the gray income that cannot be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things are inconvenient to realize, and the specific figures are difficult to count for a while. Anyway, in this war, Hudson accumulated wealth that would be difficult to possess in a lifetime in peacetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is really valuable is not these visible incomes. More are some intangible assets, especially various knowledge materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things that are rarely seen in ordinary times, because of the war, have been on the market one after another, and Hudson has really gained a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that he doesn't need to pay for these things, just show a little intention, and someone will collect them and send them over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits of power are fully reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are just a part. If someone goes deep into the expeditionary force, they will find that there is something wrong with those \"engineering regiments\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they are all peasants, but in fact they are all kinds of craftsmen. In troubled times, these people are not very eye-catching, but when it comes to rebuilding after the war, they become rare talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if someone finds out, Hudson painstakingly selected them, and he will definitely not let them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Hudson's current status, unless someone's head is flooded, he won't come over to overwhelm him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is going on in a low-key manner. Knowing that the Principality of Moxi is currently short of people, Hudson has done a good job. The recruited talents are directly incorporated into the expeditionary force, eliminating the possibility of others poaching corners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the king's special envoy, Earl Lauren, is here to visit!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this unexpected news, Hudson's face changed slightly. It seems that nothing major has happened in the Principality of Moxi recently. The country sent a special envoy here. What does this mean?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the two countries need in-depth exchanges and communication, they should first consult him, the commander of the coalition forces, or directly authorize him to handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was very dissatisfied with this sudden crossing of the line. Even if you want to cross the river and demolish the bridge, you have to wait until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, not to mention a special envoy of the king, even if the king came in person, there was no way to kick Hudson away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for Caesar III not to know such an obvious truth. But the king's special envoy still appeared outside the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is here, we have to meet again. This is the Principality of Moxi, and he seems to have nothing to worry about now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone wants to be gilded, they are going to the front line. Even the orcs are rarely seen here, and there is no military exploits at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After exchanging a few words without nutrition, Hudson's attitude quickly cooled down. In his memory, Earl Lauren was not among the top nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is not an aristocrat with real power, then this earl is most likely to be an earl of the court, and it is not worth much at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Earl of Hudson is also a false title, it is also obtained because of his military exploits, and the weight of the two is not at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Lauren quickly realized that it was a sign of impatience. Realizing this, he immediately entered the topic and said: \"Dear Earl of Hudson, this is an edict from His Majesty the King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five days ago, a wandering Beamon cavalry drove a large number of refugees into the southern part of the kingdom, causing great damage to the southern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the main force of the kingdom's army is in the northern border, the country is so empty, and the troops left behind are not enough to stabilize the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king hopes that you can lead the expeditionary force back to quell the disaster of refugees and stabilize the southern part of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opening up the edict, it was no different from what Earl Lauren dictated. It can be summed up as follows: the refugee wave broke out, and the private army of the local nobles was fighting the orcs on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please tell your majesty the king that I will lead the expeditionary army back to the country immediately after the affairs in hand are arranged.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan to lead the coalition forces to the Orc Empire to make military exploits went bankrupt, and now they can only deal with the wandering Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't believe in the huge Alpha Kingdom, which didn't even have the strength to suppress thousands of Beamon cavalry. It was probably because he was too dazzling on the battlefield, and the higher-ups felt that they needed to suppress them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have been initiated countless times in history. When it comes to dividing up the cake at the end, trying to suppress competitors is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no one in the court. At this critical moment, it is not surprising that such a change occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a side effect of the \"famous general halo\". No one knows what kind of amazing results Hudson will lead the coalition in the expedition to the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against the orcs, it is a good thing that someone has outstanding military exploits; but when it comes to dividing the cake after the war, that is another story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The greater the credit, the more cake share you will have the chance to get in the end. There can be a preference for care, but the overall distribution principle cannot be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For competitors, the best way to deal with a hero like Hudson is to hide in advance and not give him the opportunity to continue to make contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson served as the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces of the two countries, and everyone still didn't know how to start. The sudden outbreak of the refugee crisis just provided an excuse for the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an overt conspiracy that Hudson cannot refuse. What's more, the wave of refugees is like locusts, sweeping across all directions, and will soon spread to the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't care about losses in other places. The foundation of his own old nest, but he couldn't ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really asked others to do this job, he would still be worried. If someone deliberately tricked him and put the Beamon cavalry into Wright County, with Hudson's hatred for the orcs, the mountainous territory might become a piece of white land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting a business is not easy, and Hudson can't bear to part with the wealth he has accumulated so hard. If the foundation land is really destroyed, it will not be a little bit more difficult to start all over again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, there is no need for him to return to the southeast province, and his competitors will not give him a chance to rise again. It is a better choice to go directly to northern Xinjiang for development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With comfort in the south, Hudson will never move. Humans have shouted the slogan of destroying the orc empire for countless years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before each start, everyone swears: This time is different, and the orc empire will definitely be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the end result is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a lot of tossing, after being unable to bear the huge military expenditure and material transportation, he finally had to die without a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rapid progress of this war is mainly due to the temptation of the \"Secret of Longevity\". Once it is proved that this thing is unreliable, the enthusiasm of all parties to attack the orc empire will definitely suffer a serious setback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc empire is not destroyed, the northern border will always belong to the rotten land. It is easy to establish a foundation there, but it is difficult to keep it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an orc empire that has been seriously injured, it is not something that a small lord can handle. Scattered orc attacks could make him unable to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Lauren was sent away, and Hudson immediately ordered: \"Tom, arrange carriages and horses. I am going to visit Prince George and inform the senior generals of the expeditionary force to come to discuss matters at night.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm about to leave, and many things have to be handed over. Now that the situation has reversed, Chris IX, who insisted on living, has come to see the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the physical state of Chris IX, he relied on a will to persevere. As long as the breath in his chest is released, his life will come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will take a few months at most for the body to be exhausted. When the king met the Lord of Dawn, the Principality of Moxi would naturally enter the Georgian era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of personal ability, George may only be regarded as a middle-of-the-road talent; but when it comes to being a king, Hudson thinks he is a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi, whose vitality was severely injured in the war, needs to recuperate most now. In this context, it is enough for the king not to mess around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population has been greatly reduced, and many social conflicts have been resolved by the war, followed by a wave of rapid economic recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king doesn't have to do anything, he can lie down and win to become the \"king of the prosperous age\". It just so happens that George is not a master of great talent, and he has caught up with the dividends of this wave of economic recovery, and he is a big winner in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reincarnation is a technical job, and people won at the beginning of life, which is not enviable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm leaving anyway, and Hudson doesn't mind giving the future king a favor. But favors can't be given away for nothing, at least let people know that he has contributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no help from Hudson, these powers will fall into the hands of George sooner or later. But getting military power one day earlier and getting military power one day later are completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let us disturb you. You can only go there by yourself.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no intention of embarrassing the maid, Hudson waved his hand generously, indicating that she can leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world full of blood and rain, life is not easy for the children of the royal family. While having a superior life, one must also receive a harsh education.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight training is one of the essential subjects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the aptitude is not too bad, with the resources of the royal family, they will have good skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson only touched the threshold of the Silver Knight by hanging up. As the same age as Crown Prince George, he was only a little bit slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary aristocratic child outside can be called a genius if he can become a senior knight at this age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This gap is also an important reason why the big nobles can always maintain an advantage over the small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a time limit for the peak period of a person, and the road to the strong also pays attention to speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slow step by step, slow step by step, time has passed, and after the physical fitness of all aspects of the body begins to decline, the speed of cultivation will also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching George's rigorous training, even if someone approached, he didn't seem to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occupied the resting position of George, Hudson quietly acted as the audience, and the guards guarding the side were not surprised by this scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Friends, you should be more casual. Regardless of whether he is the crown prince or not, Hudson will return to China soon anyway, so there is no need to worry so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training ended soon. He picked up a towel and wiped off his sweat. George said with a smile, \"Hudson, it's really rare that you are so busy that you have time to come here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. As the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces, it is naturally impossible to be idle. Even if there is no war for the time being, there are still many military affairs to be dealt with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before today, he didn't know that he would return to China so early, and he was planning to take a large army for a walk around the Beastman Empire, so naturally he couldn't let it go badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I came to bid farewell to you today. A wave of refugees broke out in the southern part of the kingdom, and the king ordered the expeditionary force to return to stabilize the place.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if hearing some appalling news, Prince George exclaimed: \"Why, it's not fair!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's time to reap the final fruits. It is obviously uneasy and kind to call you back to China to deal with trivial matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They dare to be so against you, Hudson might as well stay with the expeditionary force, I can guarantee that you can get more here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the Alpha Kingdom can give, the Moxi Principality can double, triple, or even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you go back, and at most you can get one or two counties after the war. Here we can give half a province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire expeditionary force can obtain no less than two provinces. As long as you are willing to stay, the Koslow family will immediately become one of the top families in the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the seats of the Human Race Alliance, there will be a seat for you, which is impossible for the Alpha Kingdom to give! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the royal family of Moxi is ready to spend all their money in order to poach the wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is also based on the fact that the Principality of Moxi suffered heavy losses and a large number of unclaimed lands were born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Alpha Kingdom is much better. Although there are many nobles who died in battle, there are not many families who go to see the Lord of Dawn together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct heir of the family is still there, so the food should not be so ugly. Even if it will not fall, it will slowly decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the heir is smart enough to resolutely give up part of the benefits, he can also get the asylum of the \"beneficiary\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless several provinces in northern Xinjiang are recovered, the cakes that can be taken out are definitely not enough for everyone to share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the war is reversed too fast, and there are not enough nobles killed in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous wars, the children of nobles \"reduced overall staff\" by more than 30%. This data includes men, women, old and young, not just the loss of officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end of the war, the officers of many troops were changed from top to bottom, and the soldiers had to be changed several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every family went to the funeral, and the whole country wept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of the kingdom's nobles this time is obviously not that big. Just looking at the number of castles conquered by the orcs, it was less than a quarter of what it used to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire army was wiped out, only a dozen or so in total, far below the historical level of the same period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death rate of the expeditionary force is considered high, and the death rate of officers is just over 60%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not Hudson's fault. More than 90% of the casualties were sent out in the Battle of Dacias.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm sorry, George. I cannot accept this invitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what happened to the Alpha Kingdom, it was always the place where I was born and raised. As a patriotic nobleman, I will not leave. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    replied formulaically, with no trace of dissatisfaction visible on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world of photo and video, Hudson has always been cautious when it comes to political issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are friends, but national interests are involved, he dare not bet on George's integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conditions offered by the Principality of Moxi are indeed very high, and the conditions promised by the jumping over will be fulfilled, but it will be difficult to obtain the current respect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Loyalty\" is a very important quality in the aristocratic world. Maybe no one will say anything on the surface, but deep down, everyone has always despised this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Caesar III went against the grain and did something outrageous, Hudson would always be a \"loyal minister\" of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't change jobs, mainly because the price paid by the Mosi people was not enough. The mountainous territory is not only the mountains outside, but also the big swamp and the sea estuary behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that he has money in his hands, the value of developing all these places is no less than half a province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the fief position given by the Mosi people is still uncontrollable. George didn't even mention the specific location, but if you think about it, you know that most of them are on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the frontier provinces, the great nobles in the Principality of Moxi will not object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for obtaining fiefdoms in both countries at the same time, that is only theoretically feasible. Once an armed conflict occurs between the two countries, it is necessary to fulfill military obligations to both countries at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the pictures of people outside and there, Hudson shuddered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is not something he can bear with his small body. Only those powerful top nobles have the confidence to declare neutrality in the conflict between the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well then, I respect your choice. The door of the Principality will always be open for you, and I reserve all the fiefs for you. You can come here anytime you want.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to George's words, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly. Reserving the fief for him, it might as well be that the royal family wants to take the opportunity to expand the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it, but Hudson still doesn't mean to expose it. He was leaving anyway, and the struggle between the Moxi royal family and the domestic nobles was none of his business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then I thank you in advance!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson smiled slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At some point, there was an extra seal on the table beside him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people trade, many things don't need to be explained clearly, just a hint in the eyes, and they understand everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you don't want to come over. You won't object to us recruiting other nobles in the expeditionary army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George asked deliberately after understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, there is no need to notify Hudson about such things as poaching. It is not surprising that nobles leave for neighboring countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising this question now seems to be respectful, but it is actually asking him to raise conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, as long as they are willing to come, I have no objection. But you have to restrain yourself, you can't hollow out people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force will continue to fight in the future. I will not return the additional soldiers on your side for the time being. How about the two countries discussing it after the war? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked hint, George naturally heard the implication. It is nothing more than that some people can dig and some cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides can be regarded as getting what they need. The Mosi got low-level thugs, and Hudson calmly eliminated dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly aimed at the nobles of Wright County, and those who are half-hearted and unwilling to sincerely seek refuge are all unstable factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to arrange for them to die on the battlefield, but in the end, Master Hudson, who still had a conscience, decided not to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reluctance to seek refuge is just because they don't want to take sides in the future disputes in the southeastern provinces, and it doesn't mean they will definitely become enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wantonly eliminate dissidents, no matter how ingenious the arrangement is, people will find out the clues, and no one will dare to ask him to form a team in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply play with a wave of civilization, let the Mosi people come forward to poach people away, and Hudson will swallow their fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The supplementary soldiers were given away for free. After the war, they were discussed and all of them were \"killed\" in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of a death list, everyone has gone to the Alpha Kingdom, and it is impossible to verify whether they are dead or alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After leaving the palace, the news that Hudson resigned as the commander of the coalition forces and that the expeditionary force was about to leave quickly spread in Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, it was turbulent, but unfortunately, before they could take action, Prince George took over the army with the edict of Chris IX.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time everyone reacted, the matter had already been settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the Moxi royal family must have made great efforts to make things go so smoothly. ,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war period, the stakes are very high. They dare not let the young crown prince take the lead. It is because of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the critical moment has passed, it is in the best interests of the royal family that the crown prince control the army in advance and ensure a smooth transition of royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first thing George did after he came to power was to appraise the meritorious officials in the war, and use the opportunity of rewarding meritorious deeds to win people's hearts in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the master who turned the tide in the war, Hudson naturally also gained a share. They are the honorary title of \"Marshal\" issued by the Principality of Moxi, plus a cash reward of 300,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any exceptions, cash awards are issued on bonds. It's just that the current interest rate is no longer the original 30% annual interest rate, but has fallen off a cliff to 5%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bond rates have fallen, and this is not the first time this has happened. Except for the critical situation when the war bonds were first issued and high interest rates had to be paid, the interest rates of the later versions of the bonds have been falling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a witness and participant of history, Hudson collected all the war bonds issued by the Mosi people, ranging from the high interest rate of 30% to the lowest 5%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the Moxi people are very generous. After all the bonds are added together, the total face value is as high as 1.28 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number sounds huge, Hudson feels at ease with the money. Not only the military rewards he received as a commander, but also the life money of his private army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the Moxi people can pay these bonds normally, Hudson doesn't have to do anything, and he can get an interest income of 160,000 gold coins every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This figure is comparable to the normal income of mountain territories in peacetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you farm by yourself, you will have to struggle for at least 20 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing his subordinates complaining in private that the interest rate on the Mosi people's bonds is too low, Hudson wanted to laugh. High interest rates are useless, the key is to be able to pay normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interest rate given is getting lower and lower, which just proves that the Moxi people are ready to pay back the money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the high interest rate of 30% has been maintained, then there is no need to think about it, it is clear that you will renege on your debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know whether the low-interest rate war bonds of the Mosi people are easy to sell in the international market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is easy to sell, they can borrow new ones to repay the old ones, and first take back the high-interest bonds issued earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no usury pit, although the remaining debt is huge, at least it is not a big problem to pay the interest normally every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the domestic economy recovers a bit, maybe the principal will be returned one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't worry about these things. But with more and more war bonds in his hands, he also had to be kidnapped by interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Compared with when we came here, we shot the world with a long gun, but when we went back, the carts and carts were already full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that Hudson is not the only one who has made a fortune. The pockets of the nobles who came together also bulged. Even the ordinary soldiers below had a good harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretizing spoils of war is a bad habit that cannot be eradicated by the traditional army. Fortunately, the soldiers below had limited knowledge, and only some coins were hidden, mainly copper and silver coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even gold coins are only touched by a few courageous soldiers. This is the great wisdom of the serfs at the bottom. For them, huge wealth is a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to speed up the march, Hudson also enforced the upper limit of the spoils that all nobles can carry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unit of measurement is very rough in choosing a carriage: a viscount cannot exceed a carriage, a baron cannot exceed a quarter of a carriage, and a knight cannot exceed a tenth of a carriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before leaving, the expeditionary army camp also held a large-scale commodity fair, and staged a tearful sale. Including Hudson himself, also sold a lot of spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The buyer is naturally the great nobleman of the Principality of Moxi. Only powerful masters can do this kind of bargain-hunting business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is like this, the survivors get rich and the dead turn to dust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the start of the expedition to the return now, the expeditionary force has stayed in the Principality of Moxi for nearly a year. During the period, there were sadness and sweetness, bitterness and tears, and experienced all kinds of tastes in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the thick death list in his hand, Hudson's original joy disappeared at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a successful person, he has gained both fame and fortune. With the title of \"Marshal\", return with glory and wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the price behind this was the more than 80,000 soldiers who fell from the expeditionary force. Even if the more than 60,000 people who died in the Battle of Dacias were excluded, more than 20,000 people fell for this glory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers die a lot, and officers die a lot. 1,200 nobles of the kingdom stayed in foreign lands forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hole was poked out by Crown Prince Caesar, but the aftermath fell on Hudson. Now that he is the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, the families of the nobles who died in battle are making trouble, and his troubles are indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After feeling a lot of emotion, Hudson decisively closed the list. Some things cannot be true, otherwise life will not be able to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I came here, I wandered all the way, and the way back was already fifty miles a day. You can feel a murderous aura from a distance, and it can be seen that the expeditionary force has been reborn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mosi people's ability to dig into walls is still good. Originally, there were more than 114,000 people in the expeditionary force, but now only more than 76,000 people left with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats who committed crimes and performed meritorious service basically chose transnational immigration. They were all forced out, and as survivors of the Battle of Dacias, their troubles were far from over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose a battle, you will always be held accountable. If you can't deal with Crown Prince Caesar, you can only catch a few escaped officers and give an explanation to the families of the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if new military exploits are made later to atone for their sins, they can only be exempted from official punishment, and they still have to take the blame for the hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rewards after the war are even more without their share. It's obviously not my responsibility, but I have to take the blame. Naturally, the more I think about it, the more angry I get.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such a background, it is only natural for the Moxi people to change jobs after a little encouragement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is no need to go back to the country to feel it. Some problems can be seen from the personnel appointments within the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main positions in the army are mostly cronies promoted by Hudson. The aristocrats who have committed crimes and performed meritorious deeds are all assigned to marginalized roles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not because Hudson deliberately suppressed them, but because of political needs. The appointment of officers needs to be reported to the capital, and the commander is also responsible for the appointment of tainted officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these people, most of the aristocratic officers gathered from all over the mainland have now stayed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, although Hudson may promise to report their achievements truthfully after returning to the country, and fight for the title and land for them, but that is just a blank check after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fief given by the Moxi people can be fulfilled immediately. Although most of them are on the front line of northern Xinjiang, the nobles who can't hold back and are responsible for digging people can fool around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire must be destroyed, the Alpha Kingdom has regained its lost land, the Principality of Moxi no longer borders on the orcs... etc., a lot of theoretical basis, even Hudson was dizzy after hearing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles jumped ship, and their private army would naturally stay behind. As for the family members, the foreign ministries of the two countries are in charge of communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the country think that the cake is too small and not enough. Some people are willing to take the initiative to make room, but it is too late for everyone to be happy, and there is basically no obstacle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of troops in his hands has decreased, but Hudson's control over the expeditionary force has been further strengthened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the engineering army of more than 8,000 people, Hudson's direct troops expanded to more than 12,000 people, and the troops under the command of other members of the Koslow family also expanded to more than 13,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This does not include the supplementary soldiers provided by the Kingdom. Knowing that those people will be returned after the war, Hudson deliberately assigned them to other nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the soldiers added by my family are from the Principality of Moxi. After being harmed by orcs, most of these people are homeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no place to go, and I don't have many worries about following the coach to develop in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with when they came, the force has expanded to five times. The rapid expansion of the army was due to the hundreds of family members. It was with a group of grassroots officers and backbones that Hudson dared to play like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining tens of thousands of troops are either in the hands of my younger brother, or are commanded by nobles who are close to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A new political group with Hudson at its core has quietly formed, just waiting to take root and grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc empire, Emperor Beamon, who fled in a hurry, returned to the imperial court in a state of embarrassment after going through hardships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, when things have developed to this point, they should have come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"lord knights\" who were attracted by the secret of longevity had no intention of letting him go. He chased and killed him all the way to the hinterland of the Orc Empire, and he never gave up until he reached his goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, it is a taboo for military strategists to go deep alone, and waiting for the Alpha Kingdom's army to act together is the safest choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that along the way, many old guys have fallen down. He didn't die on the battlefield, but died because his life was exhausted, his body was exhausted, his body was exhausted, and his lamps were exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene was too cruel for the old guys who were dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The secret of longevity is close at hand, and they can all fall down early. Many old guys who are left with their last breath are naturally unwilling to waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Emperor Bimeng can last for three to five years without sending troops to attack, these old guys will almost die by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because there are few days of good work that this group of old men are particularly vigorous when they fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you are seriously injured, you will decisively pull people back. It made all the orc masters dare not show their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enemies with a failure-or-benevolence mentality are already terrifying, but these old guys are also powerful and perverted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally just went fishing, but unfortunately caught a group of big sharks, Bi Menghuang was also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boat was overturned, people were still struggling in the sea, and there was a group of sharks chasing after them, which really made people feel overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order goes on, all the Beamon cavalry are dispatched, and all tribes are ordered to bring all the young and strong to come to reinforce the imperial court immediately, and those who violate it will be exterminated!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ofman, you are in charge of organizing the old and weak members of the clan to evacuate from the imperial court. The speed must be fast, the bait we arranged will not last long, and all must be evacuated before the enemy finds the position of the imperial court. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can evacuate, but the imperial court cannot give up. With so much preparation in the early stage, if it falls into the hands of the human race, all his efforts will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the secret method of life extension, he is an old man, and he can go to see the beast **** immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next battle in the imperial court is also a battle of life and death for Emperor Bimon, and now he has no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the army to consume the enemy is not a question of whether it can be done, but that he does not have enough time to gather the entire army of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troops left behind by the Guanghuang Court were purely to deliver food to the enemy. With the development of the situation to this point, Emperor Bimeng could only hope for the heritage left by his ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he felt that he might not be able to survive this test. The secret technique that can prolong life, such a thing against the sky, how can there be no price?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he practiced, Emperor Bimeng knew that it would not be smooth sailing if he wanted to prolong his life. It's a pity that I still misjudged the difficulty here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking into the distance, thinking of his youngest son who was hiding in the front line, Emperor Bimeng was furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the knife stabbed in the back by Alex, even if there were rumors of the secret of longevity, it would not be able to attract so many immortals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, he found many traces of foreign masters. The prying eyes of the human masters are only on the surface, and there are countless old immortals staring at him secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The High Priest, I would like to trouble you to go there yourself and send an order to Alex, ordering him to come back immediately to preside over the overall situation. If you are not obedient, then forcefully bring him out to me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom, in the camp of Beamon. Crown Prince Alex is discussing with the emperors of the other four clans how to destroy the army in the enemy city with the least cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for his father's thoughts, he was no longer interested. After dozens of orders urging him to return home, Alex still didn't move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the imperial court is dangerous, and the Beamon family is in danger. But the race is dangerous, it is better than being dangerous yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying on the front line, he is still the crown prince who holds great power and aloof; when he returns to the imperial court, that is the blind medicine on the road to the longevity of Emperor Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is attacking the Beamon Imperial Court at this moment. Crown Prince Alex is not in a hurry, and the other four are even less anxious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To eliminate the vital forces of the Warhammer Kingdom and reduce the counterattack of the human race, no matter how you look at it, they are taking the overall situation into consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As if thinking of something, Alex's expression suddenly changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guard, let the double go out to inspect the camp!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Still feeling unsafe, Alex decisively left his camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even his favorite magic armor was reserved for the substitute, and he put on an ordinary leather armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not a close person, you will definitely mistake him for a Beamon soldier when you see his new outfit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After doing all of this, Alex stood guard and patrolled the camp as a soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long after, a giant golden eagle carrying an old man suddenly fell from the sky and landed in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military officers who were familiar with the identity of the old man hurried forward and said, \"High Priest, why are you here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the crowd, the old man said seriously: \"Your Majesty was unconscious in an accident, and the imperial court cannot be left alone for a day. I come here and ask Your Highness to go back and preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where is Your Highness, take me there quickly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man still looked a little unnatural. As a powerful high priest, he hadn't lied like this for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that there is no way, the order of Emperor Beamon must be completed, and Crown Prince Alex is not a worry-free master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court issued more than a dozen edicts in a row, but he ignored them. If there was no reasonable excuse, the old priest suspected that he might not even see anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex has been in the army for more than a year. As long as his brain is not too stupid, he can gain a group of supporters by virtue of his status as the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that he, the high priest, doesn't have enough face. Even if Emperor Bimeng came here in person, accidents might happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tradition is the cause of trouble, such things as usurping the throne are too common in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Emperor Bimeng himself, he rose to power by a coup. The power of an example is in front of him. It is not surprising that a son follows the example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness is patrolling the camp, you might as well take a break.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the talkative officer, the old priest scolded angrily: \"How can I rest at such a time. Take me to see His Highness immediately!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words fell, the stand-in for the battalion tour had already appeared in the sight of all the Bimons. Without the slightest hesitation, the old priest swooped up to the substitute: \"His Royal Highness, your majesty has an accident, and the imperial court needs you to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter is urgent, and we will discuss it in detail after passing through us on the road. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man had already forcibly pulled the stand-in onto the giant golden sculpture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before leaving, I did not forget to leave a sentence to everyone: \"His Royal Highness and I will go first, you guys are optimistic about the army. End the battle as soon as possible and return to the imperial court!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, two bimons and one giant eagle disappeared from everyone's sight, leaving only a group of officers staring at each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex, who witnessed this scene from the sidelines, secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, he was fooling around, but he didn't know how to report to Emperor Bimon when the old priest found something wrong later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not certain. This substitute is not an ordinary Beamon, but also a descendant of Emperor Beamon, with the blood of the royal family. Now he can fool the high priest, and maybe he can fool it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Alex had already begun to fantasize about the anger and helplessness when Emperor Beamon finished performing the secret technique happily and suddenly found out that the substitute was a counterfeit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps everyone is eager to return home, the expeditionary force is advancing slightly faster than Hudson expected, returning home one day earlier than planned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he stepped into the country, he was warmly received by the local nobles. The expeditionary force did a great job of not letting the flames of war spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is not the main reason for accepting thanks. More importantly, the murderous expeditionary force was too scary, which made the local nobles feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent their own territory from suffering military disasters, they chose to take the initiative to attack, hoping that the coach Hudson would restrain military discipline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing thing, and it is a sequela left when the expeditionary force passed through this place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The discipline of the First Legion led by Hudson is fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that Qiu did nothing wrong, at least the soldiers did not deliberately disturb the people, and they were well received along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next few legions are hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite the restrictions imposed by the noble officers, the mob is a mob after all, and there are many thieves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that there was a conflict with the nobles along the way, and now this is most likely to avoid another military disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the old-fashioned nobleman who came to greet him, Hudson didn't dare to speak too loudly, lest he accidentally send him away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can carry the knife are all on the front line, and the rest of the nobles who stay behind are the old and the young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old immortals with a little bit of strength have now gone to the Orc Empire to fight for the last wave of the secret law of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson is more willing to believe that they were responsible for making troubles in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, a group of human masters came. If they don't use their power to attack the orc empire, everyone will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a coward, leading the way is the basic operation. Wherever there is a tribe of orcs, just pass by, and there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't turn the orc empire upside down, you will be sorry for the ancestors who died at the hands of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the Koslow family background is too shallow and there are no established strongmen, otherwise they will follow the past to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone can rest assured that as long as the logistics supplies along the way keep up, the soldiers of the expeditionary force will never enter the villages and towns along the way without authorization!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson promised with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality of the soldiers is not flattering, but in terms of military discipline, no one dared to leave the camp without an order for the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that can be done in the Principality of Moxi, there is no reason why they cannot be done after returning to China. Under the military law of the continuous sitting system, if you want to go out, you have to see whether the soldiers in the same team agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you Earl for your understanding, the people in the countryside are really ignorant and easily panic when things happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that we are old, not only can't go to the battlefield, but we can't even handle such trivial things well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the old man's self-deprecating words, Hudson raised his glass and shook slightly, and said: \"You are welcome, old Marquis, you are the treasure of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, when you led your troops to fight the orcs, we juniors were not born yet!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's our turn to defend the Alpha Kingdom, and we must ask you for some advice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it politely, but deep down in his heart Hudson scolded him long ago. If he knew that the old guy hadn't gone to the front, he would never have come to this banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of people were about to see the Lord of Dawn, and the secret of longevity was close at hand, but they were able to resist the temptation. Hudson didn't know what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is precisely because of this \"dog\" that the old man in front of him, whose strength is no more than the Silver Knight, can live to this age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guy whose strength is not very good, but also good at \"Gou Dao\", who can hide when things happen, naturally doesn't have many meritorious deeds that can be shown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson wanted to boast a few words, but he didn't know that he couldn't find a topic to intervene in, so he could only have an awkward chat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to be able to hang out in the cannibal circle of aristocrats, relying on \"gou\" alone is definitely not enough. The old man in front of him is not good at leading troops to fight, but he is good at running the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he took over the family, the Alam family was about to fall from the circle of great aristocrats. With his efforts, it gradually developed into the No. 1 family in the Southwest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of comprehensive strength, it is still above the Dalton family. Hudson will also have a headache when encountering such a local snake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rise of new forces will inevitably face the suppression of established forces. This is an eternal truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't say it directly, the sudden arrival of the old guy in front of him was obviously a warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representing the local forces in the southwestern provinces told him: new players are not welcome here, don't try to take advantage of the opportunity to quell the refugee tide, and fantasize about setting up a foundation here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, a new round of reshuffle in the kingdom has begun, and the domestic struggle is a bit more intense than Hudson expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wasn't going to go to the Southwest to develop, so Hudson naturally wouldn't fight this group of people just because of this unpleasantness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, as long as there is no conflict of interest, these old guys are relatively easy to get along with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Profit-seeking corresponds to weighing the pros and cons. When encountering problems, analyzing them from the perspective of interests can solve most of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the younger generation is more troublesome. In addition to benefits, there is also jealousy from peers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Other people's children\" have always been a source of hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, at Hudson's age, he is what everyone calls \"other people's children\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only to be envied by peers, but even the generation of parents is also unavoidable. This is the price of being too good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are welcome, as the youngest marshal on the mainland, you are the leader of the young people in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, after the new round of re-election of the Kingdom Senate, there will be a place for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Zuel said cheerfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typically hit a stick and give a sweet date.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meaning is very clear, if you don't come to grab the cake, then everyone will be friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take out the position of the Senate to lure them, mainly because they are afraid that Hudson will hold grudges and let them puddle them in the next process of calming down the refugee wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, that's what Hudson was going to do. Although it is not enough to intentionally drive people to their territory, it is still okay to be so slow when acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past year, life in the southwestern provinces has not been easy. Everyone is tightening their belts to repair the line of defense, almost men, women, old and young are all in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is another wave of disasters caused by refugees, Rao Alam's family has a strong family background, and they will not be able to recover in a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this critical moment of political reshuffle, it hurts the vitality of the family, but it is very fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, thank you Marquis for your kindness, I leave the nominations to you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson raised his wine glass to signal to everyone, and then drank it all in one gulp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a naked transaction, at the cost of quelling the refugee flow as soon as possible, in exchange for the nobles in the southwestern province to push him politically in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the sequelae of no one in the court. They don't want to work it out, and they can't even get a nomination at the critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Senate seems to have no real power. That is because Caesar III is strong enough to slowly overthrow this institution with a series of show operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an institution composed entirely of great nobles, it is inherently doomed that the political status of the Senate in the kingdom cannot be low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an accident to the king, the Senate is the auxiliary government institution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This thing is not usually used, but it is very important at critical moments, and it is an indispensable decoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Naturally, Hudson will not say much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With sufficient supplies and vigorous work, without the slightest delay, the expeditionary force rushed to the front line in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees are also a resource, but only if there is no qualitative change in refugees. Once it breaks through the bottom line of human beings, it will turn from a good labor force to a social cancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development of mountainous areas requires a lot of labor. Whether this hole can be filled depends entirely on this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened that most of the refugees driven by the orcs were from abroad. Even if Hudson swallowed it in one gulp, the original owner would be embarrassed to come and ask for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are you willing to let me lead the army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the boss, it would be embarrassing enough to hang around with the third child. What's even more tragic is that he followed the expeditionary army all the way to the east and west, and he didn't even get the chance to go to the battlefield, and he kept doing odd jobs with the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Complaining is useless, lacking sufficient experience in leading troops, Hudson simply did not give him a chance to give up the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he deliberately suppressed his brother, but mainly because there were too many accidents on the battlefield. In case Nelson died on the battlefield, it would be difficult to explain to Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have a chance to go to the battlefield, naturally you don't want to think about your military exploits. Doing odd jobs in the army is just a little bit of hard work at best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss Nelson is not as good as the second Evora. There is no way, who made the eldest son and the second son have different weights?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the heir of the family, Nelson has been trained by Baron Redman since he was a child, and various resources are maximized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second child, Evola, will not be treated that way. For a father with many sons, the son who is not up to the top is the easiest to be ignored. The intensity of investment is different, and the emotional tilt is also different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that Nelson has a ready-made title to inherit, so there is no need to go all out desperately; while Evola has nothing, so he has to go out and work hard by himself, so he can only take risks on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lying flat at home, waiting to pick up a ready-made title to inherit, that's just talk. The Koslow family has many relatives, and there are more alternative heirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability that a child like Evora, who is neither high nor low, happens to be the first in line to inherit is simply zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson does not rise, in order to preserve family strength and inheritance, it is indeed possible to arrange for Evora to lie flat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as Hudson's status rose all the way, Baron Redman could no longer tolerate Evora lying flat, and was directly thrown into the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the benefit of having more sons, and there are enough spare tires in case of an accident. In addition to the three older ones in front, there are three younger ones in the back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one of them is abolished, there are still two small ones. With so many sons, Baron Redman could afford to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nelson, calm down! Generals are most afraid of impetuosity, you must learn to remain rational at all times.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being depressed for a long time, he suddenly got an opportunity, and the body instinctively excited, he could understand. But understanding is not the same as tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most taboo thing on the battlefield is impatience. Compared with the previous wars, the current suppression of rioters is indeed a small scene, but this does not mean that there will be no accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The size of the expeditionary force cannot overturn the ship, which does not mean that it will not suffer losses on local battlefields. In case of colliding with the Beamon cavalry, there will still be a lot of losses if you are a little careless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Nelson blushed slightly. Being taught a lesson by his younger brother is still a bit embarrassing for this elder brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just thinking about the gap between the two sides, he felt helpless. This is no longer something that can be caught up with hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the arrival of the expeditionary force quickly reached Prince Butzweig. Glancing at the tent behind him, he knew it was time to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge, that is based on the situation of equal strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Beamon Legion under his command had not suffered heavy losses, maybe he would still struggle. It is a pity that the war has progressed to the present, and there are not even four thousand surviving Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's revenge against the expeditionary army, even if it's a fight, he wouldn't dare. Originally there were few soldiers, if he lost some more troops, it would be his end on the way home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disaster along the way was not only due to the strength of the Beamon cavalry, but also because the countries along the way did not react and were caught off guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering such a big loss, it is impossible not to retaliate. It is conceivable that the road to return is not destined to be smooth sailing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon family paid a high price in this war, and their vitality has already been severely damaged. They must preserve their strength to deal with the next changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Pass the order down, let the ten leaders of the ten human races attack in ten ways, and choose freely to enter the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell them not to stop halfway, the opportunity to overthrow the rule of the evil aristocrats is at hand, and they must not give up at this critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the heads of the cavalry regiments were called for a meeting to discuss the return route. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to set off a wave of refugees, he used all the political wisdom of his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure coercion is too inefficient, even if it is forced by the butcher's knife to agree, it will be passive and sabotage, trying to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After many attempts, Butzweig finally chose to cooperate with the members of the cult organization, encouraging these organizations to form an army to overthrow the rule of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the sacrifice of evil gods that happened during the period, he was not surprised. Anyway, those who died were all human races, and it had nothing to do with Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on religious deceit, this barely pulled up a huge refugee team. It is known as an army of one million to the outside world, but no one knows the real situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the time is too short. It would be nice to be able to pull up the team. The internal structure of the refugee army is simply too late to improve, let alone count the number of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless new people join every day, and countless people slip away. Not a few died of illness or starvation in the middle of the journey. The logistics of such a mob team cannot be guaranteed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expeditionary army cannot be defeated in a frontal collision, then simply disperse the team and cause trouble to the Alpha Kingdom as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every inch of field destroyed, every defense building burned, and everyone killed are weakening the enemy's war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolling wolf smoke straight into the sky, another large tribe of orcs was destroyed under the butcher's knife of the knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cries that resounded throughout the world could not stop the pace of the old knight, but any hesitation was disrespect for the race war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no right or wrong here, there is only competition for the living space of the races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either kill the enemy or be killed by the enemy, this is the eternal essence of the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Morrison, aren't you familiar with the Orc Empire? We have destroyed seventeen tribes. Why haven't we found the location of the Beamon Emperor's Court?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the question from his companion, Morrison smiled awkwardly. Being able to accurately find the locations of so many great tribes is enough to prove that he really understands the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a long time to find the position of the Beamon Emperor's court, so it was hard not to let people suspect that this was killing people with a knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the orcs were killed. With the hatred between the human race and the orcs, no one would think it was too much to kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that they are not too young, they have already passed the age of impulsiveness, and this time they came here for the secret of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Camilla, you can't blame me for this. The habits of the orcs are different from ours. Their position in the imperial court loves to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original position is not equal to the current position. Especially after the outbreak of the war, the tribes that were clearly not the imperial court always liked to hang the banner of the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can only choose the location where the royal court is most likely to appear. Anyway, the Bimon royal court must be active in this area. We will definitely be able to find them if we fight all the way there. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These words are all true, the royal court of orcs really likes to move, but the royal court of Beamon is an exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Haven't moved the nest since it took root decades ago. However, in order to deceive others, Emperor Beamon still wandered around with the fake imperial court from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information detected by the major forces is basically the news of the fake imperial court. The real position of the imperial court has been tightly sealed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the true and false imperial courts are relative terms. Even if it is just pretending, Emperor Bimon is still leading the leadership team in action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called real imperial court is just that every few years must come back to live for a period of time, giving people the feeling that it is an ordinary imperial court residence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are spies mixed in, it is difficult to tell the difference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom hadn't been watching every move of the Beamon Emperor's court and carefully compared the Beamon Emperor's travel trajectory, they might not have been able to find it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then you have to hurry up, the bones of us people can't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you successfully obtain the secret technique, the conditions for using it are very strict and require a lot of preparation time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want us to help you avenge, you have to find the secret method. Don't worry, this alliance is serious, and the orcs will not be easily let go. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Camilla's words, Morrison secretly rolled his eyes. When did the Terran Alliance launch a war, not seriously?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can be the overlord of the mainland, but also has its own scruples. Difficulty in internal unity is the core factor, and the reactions of various external groups must also be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humans have enough advantages against any continental race alone, but once they face all other races, it will be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A divided human race is doomed to be inefficient in joint operations. At the same time, if you start multi-line combat, you will inevitably lose money and take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the price to be paid for the expedition to the Beastman Empire is too great. It will be difficult to truly destroy the Beastman Empire in less than ten or twenty years, and it is even more difficult for everyone to make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    learn from mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the pressure on its own future, every time the human race launches a counterattack, the Alpha Kingdom is trying every means to weaken the orc empire with the help of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific operation is very simple, just one word - kill!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly aimed at the members of the five royal families. If one more person is killed, the recovery time of the orc empire will be delayed by one point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is a little different this time. The war has not gone through the cruelest stage of \"filling in\" human lives, and it has entered the era of counterattack ahead of schedule, giving the Alpha Kingdom further ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Preparing to take advantage of the weakening of the orc empire to reduce the population of the five royal families as much as possible and achieve a hundred years of peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, there are not many tribes in the nearby area that are suspected of being the Bimon Emperor's Court. We will go to the door one by one, and we will be able to find them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Emperor Bimon returns to the imperial court, he will never escape our pursuit! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if I want to help delay the time, I don't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the Alpha Kingdom, the more troops assembled by Emperor Bimon, the better. More soldiers and horses means more casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price that the human reinforcements need to pay, the Kingdom doesn't care.

If it can be popularized, Bimenghuang will not have to send away his \"sons\" one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the army of the human race approached, the Behemoth Imperial Court also started a grand sacrificial ceremony - \"Summoning the Beast God\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it is to summon the soldiers under the command of the Beast God, the legendary Beast God Guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The powerhouses of the Beamon clan in the past dynasties would use secret methods to seal themselves in the temple when their longevity was approaching, and they called themselves the guardians of the beast gods to the outside world. Now it is this wave of people who are awakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of seal can only slow down the passage of life energy, and it will still die after a certain period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides this, there is another disadvantage: the self-proclaimed time is too long, and the sealed Beamon will slowly lose himself over the years. When awakened, there is a certain probability of becoming a lunatic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how obvious the shortcomings are, this is also the background of the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon tribe was able to rank first among the five royal families of the orc empire, and this power also played a deterrent effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in using this power is because it is a one-time killer. Once the sealed Behemoth clan powerhouse wakes up, he will soon die due to the exhaustion of his life energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that it cannot be used at the critical moment of life and death. The greatest significance of this power is not to kill the enemy, but to deter foreign enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it is used, the power that erupts is certainly powerful, but it also means that this precious power will soon disappear with the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race has reached the door, and now is naturally the moment of life and death. How much background the Beamon family has accumulated now, the Beamon Emperor has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this kind of thing is all about personal dedication. Only if I am willing to cooperate, can the seal be completed by the secret method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the scene of the summoning ceremony, Emperor Beamon was like an ant on a hot pot, running around in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not worried about the failure of this ceremony, but anxiously waiting for the return of the high priest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the overall point of view, the Beamon family has lost a complete defeat this time. The total number of Beamon cavalry lost on the battlefield exceeded 30,000, another 30,000 tribes were bloodbathed by the human race, and more than 40,000 Beamon were massacred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is not over yet, but the Beamon clan was seriously injured one step ahead, and now they are still being forced to use their background. Regardless of the outcome of the next battle, they are all big losers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The race has already lost, but Emperor Beamon himself can no longer lose. After paying such a high price, if the plan still fails, it would be a great loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the familiar chirping of eagles, Emperor Bimon's eyes lit up. I finally caught up. If it was later in the evening, it would be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Missing this battle, he will not have the ability to gather so many strong men as sacrifices again in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, something is wrong with His Highness, I can only ask him to rest first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high priest held the weak \"Crown Prince Alex's Substitute\" in one hand, and explained to Emperor Bimon on the other hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has cursed more than once: Crown Prince Alex is trash. People who are a lot of age are still dizzy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the giant golden eagle slowed down, he still kept vomiting in the sky, and the excrement accidentally stained the giant eagle's feathers, making the giant golden eagle almost rebel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they got on the Golden Eagle, they were half dead, and naturally the two of them had no chance to communicate along the way. In order to solve the problem once and for all, the high priest decisively knocked the double unconscious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that Crown Prince Alex would wake up when he arrived at the place, but he didn't expect that the \"substitute\" was a bit more useless than he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It didn't arouse the suspicion of the old priest, it was purely that Alex's **** character was too successful. Everyone thinks he is a waste who only eats, drinks, whores and gambles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how useless it is, it is still the Crown Prince. This kind of taboo thing was even bumped into by Emperor Bimeng, and the old priest was also embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, let's take him down to rest first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon couldn't see how to appease his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hanging heart finally fell down at this moment. Originally, I wanted to say a few words to my son and continue the last family relationship, but I finally gave up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the emperor, feelings are a cancer. Everything is ready, and you can't give up everything for the dispensable father-son relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless coffins on the altar began to shake, and then a loud roar was heard, and the specially-made coffins were torn apart, and a white-haired Behemoth appeared in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was just the beginning, the coffins on the field exploded one after another, and strong people continued to come out of the seal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more coffins shaking constantly, as if struggling violently. It seems that there is a mysterious force that is constantly preventing them from breaking out of the coffin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The awakened powerhouses stood there like wooden chickens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one bothered, everyone knew it was a memory match. This level is often the most difficult. If you are addicted to your own world and cannot get out, you will easily become an idiot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the outside of the Beamon Imperial Court was already full of screams and killings. Facing the enemies who came to the door, the gathered orc army immediately launched a frenzied counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results have no effect, the more intense the counterattack, the faster the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers with low morale were quickly defeated by the oncoming enemy. For a while, the rebel army spread all over the imperial court, causing the entire camp to become chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was the **** fighting instinct that awakened the sealed Behemoths. One moment it was still hazy, and the next moment it has turned into a war machine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peak duel between the two major races finally broke out in the Beamon Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, the enemy attacked in ten ways?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where are the orcs, where did they go?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's surprised Q&amp;A.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are not afraid of refugees gathering, but we are afraid of refugees dispersing. The refugees gathered together, as long as the expeditionary force is willing, they can be defeated at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, scattered refugees are more difficult to deal with. Refugees are known as a million-strong army, even if there are not a million people, there are still five or six hundred thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put 500,000 to 600,000 pigs outside for people to catch, it cannot be done in ten days and half a month. Before all the pigs are caught, they will return to their ancestors and become wild boars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you were an adult, the situation would be even more complicated. Just find a place to hide, no matter how much time you give Hudson, he won't be able to find it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, this news is indeed true. We have verified the information, and the enemy is indeed attacking in ten ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the orc army, they didn't even see a single shadow, so they probably left early. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson was shocked at first, and then calmed down again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that you can't win, but still insisting on giving the head up, it is obviously not the work of a wise man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to run all the way here and create such a big scene, the orc coach is definitely not a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to search carefully for the activities of the orc army, and report any abnormalities immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Order each legion to use the regiment as a unit to disperse and attack the enemy, and gather the refugees who are fleeing by the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately issued an order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalry ran away, and the only existence that could cause trouble to the expeditionary force no longer existed at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just facing ordinary refugees, the regiment-level establishment is enough to deal with various emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with defeating the refugee army, capturing refugee soldiers alive is more strategic for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be seen from their intentional eyes that they don't want to withdraw their troops so early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they didn't say anything on their lips, they greeted the whole family of Emperor Bimon in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Possesses the secret method of longevity, so it's fine if you don't share it with everyone, but you can't even keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the upper body is in trouble, even the strategy of the entire orc empire is frustrated. If it weren't for the stimulation of the secret method, would the Human Race Alliance still be arguing now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, there was no precedent for the arrival of reinforcements in the first year of the war, and it was the second year at the earliest, when the front line couldn't stand it anymore, and countries would send troops slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a few more months, the battlefield is another world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien race who was about to join the battlefield after being persuaded by them was now scared back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way out. Although the human race, the overlord of the continent, is now divided, its overall strength has risen instead of falling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the number of masters, one can tell that a group of old men who are dying, with the cooperation of the Alpha Kingdom's army, can kill all the way to the Bimon Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are not a small race. In the entire continent of Aslante, they are also giants second only to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was never a new thing that the second child failed to challenge the boss, but their second child's defeat was too miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few more allies participate, there is no guarantee for others, they can still destroy the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kicked away the obstacles, and the small countries behind couldn't stop their soldiers. At that time, the sphere of influence of the orc empire would be able to extend all the way to the elf coast, and face the elf kingdom hand in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a multi-ethnic country, it is also a matter of course for the mainland survivors of the ice and snow world in the extreme north to be included under its command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Orc Empire was at its peak, these races were part of them, and now they have returned to the embrace of the Orc Empire without any problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire, which has completed a major merger, is still no match for the human race, but the strength gap between the two sides will be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After forming an alliance with the elves, there is still a chance to succeed in resisting the counterattack of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the elves are willing to be neighbors with them, the emperors don't care at all. Racial competition is based on pros and cons, how can it be done by one's temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves and the orc empire did not deal with each other, but he was a natural ally when it came to fighting the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the orcs to pull hatred in front, the heavy hammer of the human race will fall on the elves. Compared with the poor and white orc empire, the elves themselves are precious wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go, the battle here is over, and it's time for us to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Terran Alliance are about to arrive in the Principality of Moxi, and they will come to rescue them in a short time. The opportunity to destroy the Warhammer Kingdom is gone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang said with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An opportunity that was close at hand just slipped away from under the nose. In the future, it will become more and more difficult to change the pattern of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no major changes in the future, the dominance of the human race in the mainland will become more and more stable after this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's take a look again, I'm afraid we will never have the chance to come back this time in this lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That immortal Bi Menghuang is really a scourge! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to provoke this war, he lost his face. In the end, he was really not reconciled to end up in such a dismal situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the use of saying this, the old and immortal people of the human race have all killed the Beamon imperial court. Even if he handed over the secret method of longevity, they will not let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he was lucky enough to escape the hunt of the human race, there are so many old and immortal people in the whole continent who are sharpening their knives, and he can't escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about a dying Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this spare time, we might as well discuss the post-war matters first. For example: the future political structure of the empire! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said carelessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon clan suffered heavy losses, and the bear clan didn't feel better either. The only consolation is that the disaster this time was caused by Emperor Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the Orc Empire to liquidate the two royal families at the same time. Even if a power struggle breaks out, it will only target one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang chose to bring it up at this time, obviously to stir up fire and encourage everyone to point the finger at the Bimon Imperial Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Looking at the posture of the human race, most of them will initiate a liquidation against us in the future, and if we deal with it a little carelessly, we will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too early to discuss the post-war issues, let's discuss after the war is over!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid some unnecessary conflicts, it is best for everyone to appease the tribes under them first, and remove the unstable factors in advance, so as not to make jokes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor changed everyone's expressions. All previous wars have a common purpose - to consume excess population and cleanse unstable tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation this time is a bit special. Although the army they lead has completed the cleaning task, something happened on the Alpha battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the army was defeated, the human army only chased and killed the main force of the five royal families, and ignored the fleeing other races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the ebb and flow, those powerful races that survived the catastrophe became unstable factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then the offensive and defensive trend is reversed, and the human race's key targets must be on them, and there is a high probability that they will pay heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these strong fighting races with intact strength are not suppressed, it is likely to become a major hidden danger that threatens their rule after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the strength of these races is weak, how about the neighbor of the Alpha Kingdom to help?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is good at playing politics. If there is an opportunity to stir up civil strife in the orc empire, they will definitely not let this opportunity go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs were worried, and Joseph II was even more worried. Now that the war has progressed, only the 10,000 people who follow him are left as the direct lineage of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an armed force can only be considered shabby in the hands of a big noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles can rely on this armed force to survive, but it does not mean that the king can also. Everyone will not fight for the throne, but in the fight for the right to speak in the kingdom, it is impossible for everyone to give in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the news of the withdrawal of the orc army came, the internal fighting became more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eastern nobles want to get back everything they had before, while western nobles want to share a bigger cake, and the two sides are arguing endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were even more than one fights broke out in private, and the casualties directly exceeded three digits, which made Joseph II furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he can't do anything yet, and if he is a little careless, the western nobles will criticize him for being unfair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of people complaining about \"handling things unfairly\", but they dare to say so publicly in the court, which is rare in the entire continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs have just started to evacuate, so it's not good for us to evacuate in such a hurry!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the western region, they belonged to others, and the eastern nobles were naturally not the opponents of these sitting tigers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going back to your own territory is undoubtedly the best choice to save the situation. But the problem is that the eastern part of the kingdom is not the former prosperous eastern part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being brutally ravaged by the orcs, it has now turned into a piece of white ground, it can be said that the ground is full of bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This ghostly place is simply not suitable for human survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly moving there, even if you have a strong heart and don't taboo about these things, you still have to consider practical issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army plus the noble families and servants who evacuated early, eating and drinking for a group of hundreds of thousands of people is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The western nobles dare to be so arrogant now, not only to vent their grievances accumulated in the past, but also because of the short-mouthedness of these outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I'm afraid this is beyond our control. The people in the west have too much appetite. We have promised to make concessions, but they still refuse to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the Chaotang, plus one-fifth of the land of the Warhammer Great Plains, still can't satisfy their appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the compromise continues, I am afraid that the Kingdom of Warhammer will be their kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Gay arched the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had a choice, he would not be willing to jump out and fight against the nobles in the west, after all, they have the upper hand now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they get back their foundation, it will not take a day or two to restore their strength. For a long time to come, the nobles in the west will have the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the contradictions accumulated in the past are too deep, especially after the last war, the matter of deliberately leaving the western nobles as cannon fodder completely ignited the contradictions between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to stir up disputes, but difficult to quell them. Once many things are on the bright side, it means that there is no compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military ministers, foreign ministers and other important ministers of the kingdom were taken down one after another. If he, the prime minister, hadn't been supported by the king, he would also have to resign and leave in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People's reasons are too good. The situation in the kingdom has deteriorated to the present, and someone at the decision-making level must be responsible for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army has been defeated all the way, and the Ministry of Military Affairs is to blame. Just let the Minister of Military Affairs resign and leave, and not continue to pursue responsibility, it is all because everyone is aristocratic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diplomatically vying for aid from the Alliance, they lost to the Kingdom of Alpha and the Principality of Moxi. Naturally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has deteriorated to the point where few high-level people in the kingdom can say that they are not responsible. Just lift the lid and everyone has to get out of their seats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II tried his best to protect the prime minister, not because he valued this capable general so much, but because he needed someone to attract firepower and prevent the spearhead from being directed at himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the ministers go down, then the king is responsible for it. The operation method is very simple, just give up the throne to your son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the king is willing to cooperate, everyone is a \"loyal minister\" of the kingdom and will never kill the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up, you can't talk nonsense like this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II snapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's just a struggle between the nobles between the two camps. The western nobles are only dissatisfied with him, but they haven't reached the point where they want to change the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they stand with the eastern nobles again, it will be difficult to guarantee that the situation will not evolve to that point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in order to maintain the political balance of the kingdom and ensure the stability of the royal power, he had to support the disadvantaged eastern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the contradictory body caused Joseph II a particularly headache. It's like dancing on two eggs. If you don't pay attention, the eggs will break and you will be miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no Beamon cavalry to make trouble, and a group of rioters led by a cult organization were naturally no match for the expeditionary army. Since the division of troops, the good news has never been interrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Catch three thousand here, five thousand there. Soon the main task of the expeditionary force was not to fight, but to guard the captured prisoners of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more and more captives, the pressure on Hudson is also increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the war progressed until now, the population loss of the Alpha Kingdom was not small, especially in the fallen provinces in the north, where the population loss was even more severe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now that the uninhabited provinces further north have been recovered, the noble lords who acquired these lands after the war have to worry about the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities are reserved for those who are prepared. The dust has not yet settled, and the great nobles in the kingdom have already set off a war of robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of prisoners of war in the hands of the expeditionary force soon came into everyone's sight. Regardless of whether they have friendship or not, they have sent representatives over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of important nobles, Hudson was also very helpless. Although there are many prisoners of war, they are not enough for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, he himself has to get a share, and the younger brothers under his command also get a share, and the rest can be used for points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the limited number of prisoners of war in hand, it becomes a test to give to whom and not to give to whom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone shared it together, it wouldn't offend anyone, but don't expect anyone to think well of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone will just take it for granted, and even most people will complain about the lack of points. Because the result of fair distribution of the cake is often lower than their respective expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson will not do such a thankless stupid thing. Instead of being complained by everyone, it is better to selectively offend a group of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to allocate the cake in his hand, Hudson has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who is friend and who is foe?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This question, now he can't tell the difference at all. This is the biggest disadvantage of getting up from below, and it is impossible to accurately position yourself immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves deep-seated interests, and many things cannot be seen on the surface. Being friendly does not mean being a friend, and having a bad attitude is not necessarily an enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many things to consider behind this. To determine whether a big noble is an enemy or a friend, not only the relationship between the two parties must be considered, but also the marriage behind them, their respective circles, and the location of the fiefdom...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson would not dare to leave this kind of matter involving the future. We can only sort out and screen one by one with the limited information in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"enemy\" is selected and put aside, and the potential competitors are selected and put aside. These are the first things to be eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter whose face it is, you can't do things for the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles with unknown positions and neutral camps, these are the objects that can be won, and that is another kind of treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the allies, this is very regrettable. The Koslow family has not yet become an ally with any big noble, but has several enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention making friends, there are only a handful of great nobles who have made friends with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People who are not from one world, forcibly joining a circle, are not people from all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very embarrassed, rising too fast, there is no time to build a network of contacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a network of connections, it is still in the Principality of Moxi. Everyone has no conflict of core interests, so you can make friends with confidence and boldness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When mixing in the middle and lower aristocratic circles, there is also the Koslow family's network of connections, and Hudson's mixing is also very popular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's current position, when he needs to face the nobles of the whole country, the family's connections can't keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After fighting one after another, this special army was still not able to leave behind, but time is not forgiving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war only caused this army to suffer heavy losses; the years have brought this army to its end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many old and strong men did not die at the hands of the enemy, but their bodies were exhausted due to the high-intensity battle, so they went to meet the Lord of Dawn in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the belief that supported them has collapsed. Emperor Beamon, who was suspected of possessing the secret of longevity, met the beast **** amidst a roar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the defeat of the orcs and the death of Emperor Beamon, the truth of the secret law of longevity also surfaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mysterious altar, rune carvings in the underground palace, countless strong bones, five special hanging coffins, the corpse of the false crown prince...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific operation process is no longer important, and these things found in the underground palace alone are not enough for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone is insane in order to prolong life, there must be enough sons sacrificed. Even if an individual has many lives, where can he find so many sacrifices for the strong?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using the power of the orc empire, it took more risks than Meng Huang to get together the last sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the secret has been exposed, as long as there are large-scale disappearances of strong people in the future, people will immediately think of this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing that challenges the bottom line of human morality, leaving any clues, will attract crowds to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many restrictive conditions, and it only prolongs some lifespan, and it cannot achieve real longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon died under the backlash. Who can prove that the secret method exposed must be effective?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of elderly people in their dying years, the final shattering of faith is the end of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if people are still alive, don't expect them to continue to work hard. The team originally organized for the \"Dream of Longevity\" has now dispersed because of the \"dream of longevity\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the strong ones of the Alpha Kingdom who chose to stay in the army and contribute their last strength to the kingdom; most of the strong human races who survived chose to leave this sad place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this group of masters playing the vanguard, the Kingdom's army would not have the strength to sweep the Quartet. After the Battle of the Royal Court ended, Marshal Campbell immediately chose to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, things are always unexpected. It was smooth sailing when I came, but it was not so easy to go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs who came out of nowhere kept launching various attacks, making the army restless for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These minor troubles can only be regarded as small troubles. The bigger trouble is that the orc army on the front line of the Warhammer Kingdom is on the way back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current withdrawal speed of the army, the probability of an encounter between the two sides on the way is not generally high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this expedition that went directly to the Beamon Royal Court, the Alpha Kingdom has used its strength, and almost all the main forces in the kingdom are on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to compete for the post-war cake, the major nobles also tried their best. Compared with the success or failure of the front line, the group of prisoners in Hudson's hands is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the envoys did not evacuate, the frequency of harassment of Hudson was obviously greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the situation on the front line is clear, competing for interests is a joke. Once one's own strength is severely damaged, no matter how much one eats, one will have to spit it out in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you have achieved an earth-shattering record after paying a heavy loss, everyone needs to pay attention to eating to avoid prying eyes from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this deadline is time-limited. When everyone forgets this contribution, everything will return to the essence of the jungle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Evola, you are in charge of escorting these 10,000 people back to the Mountain Territory. This is a letter I wrote to my father, and he will naturally know how to arrange it when the time comes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone intercepts you on the road, you don't have to give face. As long as you stand up for the truth and don't cause noble casualties, I will support you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered his second brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the eldest who inherited too much wisdom from his parents, so that Evola is a simple-minded product, and his limbs are not \"developed\" enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't have enough mind and strength. As long as the execution is strong enough, it is also a talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Hudson's elder brother, his identity is the greatest value. Escorting refugees may seem simple, but it is also very complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter local snake Kayao on the way, ordinary nobles really can't be shocked. Especially when you meet a big nobleman, if your status is not equal, you will not be tough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One thing falls one thing, if you really encounter a shameless stumbling block, a reckless guy like Evola is the most suitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Imply, do not understand; expressly, refuse directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ming grab is impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the main force of the kingdom going out, the tens of thousands of expeditionary troops in Hudson's hands are already the strongest armed force in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't rob other people because he was saving face. Anyone who dared to rob the expeditionary army must have lost his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, there are only a few thick-skinned ones, relying on their own status, trying to take advantage of the little nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the Patriarchs are on the front line, and Evola's status is exactly the same as that of those left behind. It's okay to spray and scold, even if it's a fight, it doesn't hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it's better not to fight if you can. The main reason is that his second brother is not strong enough, and there is a high probability that he will not be able to win him in a duel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, why don't I take a trip! Arrange for the second child to go there, in case there is a conflict with the Dalton family, he may not be able to handle it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nelson, what do you mean, are we afraid that the Dalton family will fail?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evola asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a reason for being hostile to the Dalton family. The expeditionary force was suddenly transferred back to China, and it was the Dalton family who took the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were originally competitors, but they were plotted against by the other party once again. Naturally, the relationship between everyone will not be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he came back to suppress the rebellion, he had an advantage when dividing up the refugees; but he led the coalition forces to the front, and Hudson could get more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the current situation, if the Royal Army suffers a big defeat, Hudson may even have the opportunity to take over the position of Marshal Campbell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to become the top military boss just flew away. It is only a problem that members of the Koslow family do not hate the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still a gap in strength between the two sides, but the current Koslow family and the second family in the province are still allies. The combined strength of the two is even better than the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Dalton was also forced to drag Hudson back. Who made the military strength of the Koslow family expand too fast?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other families are getting weaker and weaker on the battlefield, but the Koslow family is getting stronger and stronger. How does this make competitors mess up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is really allowed to become a military leader and make a little move during foreign wars, maybe the Dalton family will be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The highest state of killing with a knife is never to send a death mission on purpose, but to arrange a mission that seems safe but is destined to have accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary generals are not capable of such a far-reaching layout, but \"famous generals\" who grow up on the battlefield can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who wears the \"halo of a famous general\", has made many nobles in the country feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Evora, I don't mean that. The main reason is that we don't need to directly conflict with the Dalton family now, and no amount of grievances can be settled until after the war is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case they have an accident on the battlefield, some people will push the wall, we don't need to be this villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is even more unsuitable to be this villain! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson's words made Hudson smile. Being able to see this proves that his training was not in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pressing Nelson along the way and not letting him go to the battlefield is not only a security consideration, but also an exercise of his political ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with outsiders, brothers are always more reliable. In any case, we must cultivate talents, and we must give priority to training those with a higher safety factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The general social environment is like this. When knowledge is strictly sealed, all the big nobles are playing the game of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson thinks that he can still suppress these brothers, enough to prevent them from having delusions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, that's it for this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evola, as the person in charge of the first **** of refugees; Nelson, as the person in charge of the second **** of refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Dalton family, don't take the initiative to provoke. If someone stretches out their hands randomly, don't be too polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't want to turn against them yet, if possible. The kingdom's political reshuffle has just begun, and we cannot judge friends and foes based on our inherent concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today we are competitors with the Dalton family, but who can guarantee that we will not become allies tomorrow? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words directly confused the two of them. If his prestige was not too high, they might have jumped up to refute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Geopolitics, but their recent major. A large number of historical cases have proved that neighbors with conflicting interests will eventually become enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson did not explain. There are some things that can only be understood by oneself, and cannot be understood by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeast province cannot accommodate two great nobles, but it does not mean that the two are hostile all the time and cannot reach a compromise within a period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family now has military strength, but lacks a matching economic foundation, and needs a lot of time to consolidate the foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Dalton family also needs time, the two sides may reach a compromise in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, everyone wears shoes now, and they have escaped from the life-and-death struggle at the bottom, and can't just bet on the top players.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is almost impossible to withdraw the army intact under the eyes of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allies can't be counted on, the Warhammer Kingdom is completely abolished, and within a few decades, it will not be able to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi also suffered heavy losses. Before joining the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance, don't expect them to play much role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Organize reinforcements to respond, reckoning that the battle will be over before the team is assembled. Now the Alpha Kingdom, there is no way to gather hundreds of thousands of elites to respond in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Military Affairs Department, how are you going to deal with the current complicated situation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't solve it by yourself, leave the trouble to professionals. Compared with him, the king with two swords, the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Military Affairs are all from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is not suitable for us to do too much in the current complicated situation. We can only hope that the frontline troops will actively respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has been fought so far, not only the kingdom has suffered heavy losses, but the orcs are also suffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a war breaks out, we may not lose. Even if you can't win a big victory, you can still inflict heavy damage on the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell has rich combat experience and is on the front line. He has a much deeper understanding of the situation than we do. I believe he will be able to handle it properly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is to cheer yourself up. The real situation on the front line cannot be explained clearly by a few words sent back by the Griffin Cavalry every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many variables on the battlefield. For the sake of safety, the detailed military deployment on the front line does not dare to let the Griffon cavalry come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the intelligence is intercepted by the enemy halfway, it will be a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience told Archduke Effiero that it is best not to intervene indiscriminately without knowing the specific situation on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at the Minister of Military Affairs, Caesar III finally swallowed the curse words back. Things have happened, and it cannot be resolved with a few curses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all tricked by those old men. How exciting the army was in the early stage, how difficult it is to return now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure force majeure cannot be resolved by the Ministry of Military Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the alliance's reinforcements have entered the Principality of Moxi, and it is expected that they will be able to join forces with the Moxi army in seven days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already urged, and if all goes well, the army will be able to arrive at the front line in about a month. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs Earl Francis said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Changed the topic of Dafa, which eased the embarrassment on the field. But the problem still needs to be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking twice, Caesar III found out embarrassingly that not adding chaos would be the greatest help to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Campbell is in charge of the battle situation on the front line, I can rest assured!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to follow up on the reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was passed on, and the expeditionary force was renamed the Southeast Front Army, and Earl Hudson was asked to wipe out the rioters as quickly as possible and lead the army northward. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with a slightly dignified expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the reassurance on the lips is not consistent with the real thoughts in the heart. If he didn't know what to do, he wouldn't be in a hurry to transfer Hudson north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of a change on the front line, the Southeast Front Army is the foundation for reorganizing the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified king, prepare a few more countermeasures, which are all routine operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there are still a large number of prisoners of war in the hands of the far... southeast front army. How do you think they should be arranged?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this group of strong laborers, there was almost a fight within the kingdom. If it weren't for the unexpected changes on the front line that attracted everyone's attention, the carve-up operation might have already begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Hudson has a certain decision-making power over the allocation of prisoners of war, but that can only be done in secret, and the boss on the surface is still Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Private granting is not a big problem, but the premise is that there is a degree. While secretly carve up, it is also necessary to leave enough distribution shares for the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These prisoners of war are different. Most of them were forcibly forced by the orcs to join the rebel army. Only the chief culprits will be investigated, and the coerced followers will be dealt with lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sent a prisoner of war resettlement team to take over the prisoners of war from the southeast front army and deal with them after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the kingdom's heavy losses this time, and the lack of labor force in many places, it's better to distribute them as spoils of war after the war to the meritorious ministers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with some melancholy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cake dividing is often the most complicated process, and it is a bit more difficult than making cakes. Who gets more and who gets less requires all-round consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the royal family is also short of people!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the recovered northern territory, the royal family occupies a large proportion. Without the filling of millions of people, production cannot be resumed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many prisoners of war captured, they are not at the same level as the demand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the boss cannot eat alone, and the limited \"prisoners of war\" labor has to be shared with the kingdom's nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, Marshal Campbell is leading the army slowly forward. The already bad road ahead has become even more unbearable under the destruction of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time spent building roads every day is fully three times the time spent marching. Even if manpower is arranged to work overnight, it still cannot change the fact that the army is advancing at a fast pace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a sufficient number of strong men to open the way ahead, the Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army is just an ordinary elite, and it also needs to work hard to overcome various difficulties encountered along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enemy attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the shouts in the battalion, Marshal Campbell didn't respond at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes happen several times a day. The more times you see it, the higher your immunity will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, it was another attack of \"big thunder, little rain\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of orcs lurking on both sides used simple tools to set traps and launched a surprise attack on the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just leave after fighting, the kind that doesn't take a cloud with you. However, the experienced Northern Expeditionary Army was not a soft persimmon, and immediately launched a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few lucky orcs who were still fleeing, the rest were sent to meet the beast god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop chasing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the order of the officer, an attack came to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in pursuing responsibility. It is too simple for a team of dozens of people to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is still in a hurry to hurry, and has no time to spend time with them here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, seventeen of our troops were killed and thirty-six were wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wounded have already been treated by a priest, and it is estimated that they will need a few days of recuperation before they can recover. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the middle-aged officer said, Marshal Campbell nodded slightly and said: \"Follow the old rules and don't delay the advance speed of the army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scowl between his brows has revealed the panic in his heart. According to the current marching speed, it is almost inevitable that the road will be blocked by the returning orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were a different battlefield, Marshal Campbell would not mind setting up a battle with the orcs, but this is the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battles, they swept countless orc tribes along the way, killing millions of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This **** feud, once blocked by the enemy, will inevitably attract countless orcs to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the longer the delay, the more unfavorable it will be to the Northern Expeditionary Army. If a slight flaw is exposed, the loss will be heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it is useless to be anxious. The \"Grand Knights\" are wayward, and they will let go of the pick if they say they will, without giving them any face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the \"overwhelming\" magician group, the roads that were destroyed along the way became the biggest obstacle to the return of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the small attack formed by orcs along the way was not taken seriously by Marshal Campbell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adhering to the principle that whatever the enemy does, that is, no division of troops, the Northern Expeditionary Army has always marched in groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are very obvious, and there will be no opportunities for the enemy to take advantage of; the disadvantages are also very prominent, that is, the army advances more slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly the city of the Orc Empire, which is too unsightly. Along the way, there was no strong city that could accommodate the Northern Expeditionary Army. Otherwise, Marshal Campbell would definitely take the team in as a \"nail house\" and wait for the reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stopping and stopping along the way, Marshal Campbell is also constantly observing the four directions, looking for terrain that is conducive to the army's defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the Griffon scouts have just received news that the orc army that has withdrawn from the Warhammer Kingdom has now appeared one hundred and fifty miles away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the wild geese flying north in the sky, Hudson, who stepped into his homeland again, touched the elf bow in his hand, and finally extinguished the idea of ​​hunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winter goes from spring to spring. In this season when all things flourish, it is really not suitable for killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Returning to the southeast province this time, it is a proper false public service. Although there are also rioters here, the pitiful number is not enough for the local nobles to stay behind to clean up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom prepares the car, I'm going to visit the Holliser family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I arrived in Qiaomu County, I couldn't justify it if I didn't go to my father-in-law's house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Mountain Territory, it is really inconvenient to go back. There is also a limit to selfishness, and Hudson, whose foundation is unstable, has to consider gossip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few rumors may seem inconspicuous, but they can cause bad things at critical moments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, the king's special envoy, Earl Lauren, is here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guard's words directly shattered Hudson's idea of ​​going out. The face of the boss of the family still has to be given, and the envoys have been sent out, and they must meet with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he is poisonous. The king's special envoys have come over all the time, but it seems that there is no good result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first one was the worst, being accidentally killed by the Holy See on the way home; the second Count José survived, but he was blamed for his failure in the Battle of Dacias; it depends on whether the third Count Laurent can escape This is doomed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sincerely hoped that nothing would happen to this man, otherwise the title of nemesis of the king's special envoy could easily be crowned on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him \"better than others\" now, a lot of people holding magnifying glasses, looking for his flaws?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please come over, Earl Lauren.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson didn't find it strange that the expeditionary force was renamed the Southeast Front Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all returned to the mainland, and it has nothing to do with the fact that the expedition is a copper coin. If they continue to hang the banner of \"Aiding the Moxi Principality Expeditionary Army\", it will become nondescript.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Urging the southeast front army to quickly quell the refugee tide and then go north immediately, the hidden things behind this are not a star or a half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was hard to find an excuse to keep Hudson in the rear, and now let him go to the front line, which is clearly a tiger into the jungle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are a few more victories, Hudson's right to speak in the distribution of the cake after the war will definitely increase greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a little bit of luck, it is easy to become a military leader, and it is not so simple to suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified king, under normal circumstances, he would not participate in the infighting among his subjects. Even if internal conflicts intensify, Caesar III should also appear as an arbitrator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making such a decision now is a slap in the face for the nobles who originally wanted to suppress Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a political interpretation, it is: their right to speak in the court has declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this chain reaction starts, the subsequent development of the situation will be out of control. It is estimated that the few companies that made the move will most likely be scolded in anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Lauren, where is the situation on the front line?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a pie falls from the sky, it can kill a person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unreasonable love and hate in this world. Unless the situation on the front line is dangerous, Caesar III has no reason to risk offending those families and push him over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson misunderstood, the situation on the front line is still under the control of the Kingdom. The Northern Expedition Army is retreating, and there has not been a major battle with the enemy yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the southeast front army is called to go north, mainly because they are worried that the orcs will suddenly change the direction of attack and launch a sneak attack while the kingdom's troops are empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of the kingdom, Your Excellency should end the war in the southern part of the kingdom as soon as possible, and send troops to the north as soon as possible to prepare for any eventuality. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Lauren's explanation, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly. This rhetoric was too perfunctory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How strong is the head of the orcs, will they continue to invade the Alpha Kingdom at this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are not afraid of being shut down and beaten, you still have to consider the reaction of the Human Race Alliance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they gain the upper hand on the battlefield, the second batch of reinforcements from the Terran Alliance will come soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being brutally beaten by the society just now, seeing the strength gap between the two sides, and provoking again, it would be really tiresome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, if Hudson is the king of the orcs, he will shrink back and play defensive battles at this moment. Playing and stopping, not pursuing a big victory, as long as you can delay time is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humanity's memory is short. As long as it drags on for a few days, the determination of the major forces of the human race to destroy the orcs will be wiped out in the long battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this catastrophe is over, we will talk about the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overlord of the mainland should not be insulted lightly. If he pokes the basket and set himself on fire, he has to let the resentment in his heart be given out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Lauren, every move of the orc army is closely watched by the kingdom. It is almost impossible for them to launch a sneak attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few provinces that have just been recovered are now a piece of white land, just as a buffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this transitional period, the castle fortress in the rear is presumably ready. It shouldn't be a big problem to delay the pace of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, you can rest assured that the southeast front army has settled the rebellion and pacified the rioters, and then rush to reinforce, there will be enough time in time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said cooperatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pretend to be stupid, who can't!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has deployed so many defense lines in the north, even if the main force is exhausted, there are still a large number of serf soldiers staying behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a strong city blocking the way in front, and there is the main army of the returning kingdom behind. Only fools attack the city under such circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how warlike the orcs were, they had to deal with the main force of the kingdom before thinking about attacking the city. Otherwise, if the city is not captured, the back road will be cut off first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Lauren was about to say something, but he swallowed the words again. The two had dealt with each other once, and he knew how difficult Hudson was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the person in front of him has made up his mind, he, the envoy, cannot control him. To do Hudson's ideological work, Earl Lauren doesn't think he has the qualifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Offending a powerful nobleman for a mission, there is no guarantee that the mission will be completed smoothly, it is purely a proper loss-making transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he has already brought it, and if he didn't achieve his goal, it's because the king's face is not big enough to make the other party give up the benefits he got.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson did a lot more than Earl Lauren expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Privately embezzling prisoners of war is just an inconspicuous little operation. In order to capture more prisoners of war, the Southeast Front Army has crossed the national border and went to help neighbors quell civil unrest for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with whether you are patriotic or not. The main reason is that the demand for prisoners of war in the mountainous territories is somewhat large. Without capturing enough prisoners of war, Hudson's private actions crossed the line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, in this kind of super easy war against chaos, the commander-in-chief can decide 50% to 70% of the spoils, and the rest is distributed by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific ratio shall be determined according to the actual situation. Being able to decide the distribution of so many spoils does not mean that Hudson can directly embezzle them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who participated in the war under his command must give a share. The great nobles who came to the door had to be given part of it. These people did not contribute to this war, but they controlled the right to speak in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not over yet. If relatives and old friends come to your door, you will inevitably get a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are prepared, and the rest is Hudson's own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the proportion of the coach will not exceed 10%, plus all members of the Koslow family, then at most one-fifth will be taken away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The share of the cake cannot be increased, but the size of the cake can be changed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending troops for free to help neighboring countries put down rebellions, this kind of fearless international spirit is definitely worthy of praise. In theory, there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of prisoners of war, that is a matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is entirely possible to wait for everyone to sit together after the war and discuss slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The return of prisoners of war will definitely happen. The final specific number depends on their respective operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following troubles, Hudson doesn't care. The great nobles who want to take advantage of it will naturally respond to the demands of other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the largest human country in the northern continent, the Alpha Kingdom still has a bit of a reputation. Such a small conflict should not be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, these neighbors also put the kingdom together before. It was agreed that everyone would join forces to fight against the orc invasion. When the war really broke out, all kinds of excuses came up one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the Beamon cavalry went to these small countries to stir up the situation, and the kingdom was happy to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The longer the hand stretches, the more time it will take. The southeast front army has not been able to quell the civil unrest for a long time. This is the most important factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that such a good deal is destined to not last long. Hudson is willing to help for free, but the nobles in his country are not stupid!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you didn't notice it at first, when groups of prisoners of war were escorted to the Alpha Kingdom, everyone should wake up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the southeast front army was robbing their population, nobles from nearby countries became active in suppressing the rioters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One by one, they no longer cared about killing people with a knife, and tried their best to quell the turmoil in the shortest possible time, and did not give the southeast front army a chance to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing his official duties, Hudson stepped into the mansion of Viscount Oran again. Compared with before, the current viscount is much more heavily guarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that they are aware of the instability of the situation, and they are worried that someone will come to take advantage of the fire and take precautions in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an in-law, Hudson is also considered half of his own family, and directly entered the inner courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one came out to greet him. It wasn't that Hudson's face was small, but it was because the hostesses were all on the front line, and it was inconvenient for the hostess who stayed at home to show her face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A familiar voice sounded, Hudson looked in the direction of the sound, and a beautiful figure appeared in front of his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beside him was a middle-aged lady with a teenager about ten years old, watching him from the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's been a year since Hudson was about to reach out to hug his fiancée, when he suddenly felt something was wrong, and hurriedly retracted his half-stretched hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mrs. Narcissa, Sir Locke, Hudson sends his greetings to you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Messing around in front of his mother-in-law and brother-in-law, Hudson is not crazy yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, and me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that she was missed, Melissa said dissatisfiedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Beautiful and charming Miss Melissa, Hudson sends you my greetings!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the guards following behind had already taken out the gift prepared in advance and handed it to the maid beside him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's about the same!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa pouted and said. Hudson couldn't help but want to pinch that pink and tender little face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the occasion was wrong, he had to be polite. Even if the two are fiancées, etiquette among nobles is still indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome our hero, the Earl of Hudson. The Holliser family will be proud of your arrival!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Madam Narcissa smiled back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The selected potential stocks directly soared into the sky, which is definitely something worth celebrating for investors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally when this marriage was decided, there were still many criticisms from the outside world, thinking that the Holliser family was really in decline, reduced to the point of looking for \"potential stocks\" to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon the situation reversed. Before everyone understood what happened, Hudson jumped up from below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the rise is too fast, so fast that everyone wants to suppress it, but it is too late to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Potential stocks soared into the sky, and the Holliser family obviously won the gamble. Originally, I just wanted to use the force of the Earth Bear, but I didn't expect Hudson to perform too well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A front army commander, that is already the treatment of a governor of a province. The most important thing is that the southeast front army in Hudson's hands is still all veterans who have come down from the battlefield, and more than half of them are elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of real combat power, it is obviously far more than the military power of a province. Coupled with the effect of \"famous general halo\", the weight in the eyes of the outside world is even heavier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Awkward chats without nutrition are hard to sustain. After a few polite words with Madam Narcissa, Hudson decisively chose to communicate with Melissa alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is an extra follower behind him, the young little Locke, like a problem boy, pestering him all the way to ask questions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little brainstorming, Hudson knew that this was deliberately arranged by Madam Narcissa. I guess I hope my youngest son can have a good relationship with him, and it would be even better if he can learn some art of war along with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is not ruled out that they are arranged to monitor them, so as not to leave any loopholes for Hudson to exploit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it didn't bother him, he fooled away the obtrusive Locke in less than a cup of tea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally able to get along alone, Hudson didn't know what to say, a typical lack of love cells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the unique charm brought by the status of a strong man, coupled with the traditional arranged marriage system, he doubted very much whether he would be able to find a suitable partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't you want to say something to me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There are still a lot of things in the army, waiting for Hudson to arrange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farewell to his fiancée, Hudson's action of dividing up the prisoners of war became more and more rapid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he take away his share, but he also quickly arranged for the share that the nobles under him should get.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even relatives and friends, old aristocrats in the country, and local snakes who helped the army all took a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This quick way of cutting through the mess directly made Earl Lauren's face livid with anger, but it was a pity that Hudson didn't buy it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king has to abide by the rules of the political game, let alone just a special envoy. If you have a favor, you must earn it yourself. How can Hudson give it to others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    belongs to the share allocated by the king, and he didn't move. At first glance, they are all \"models of loyal ministers\", without the slightest overstepping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 600,000 prisoners of war captured in the country are divided up, and the prisoners of war who are being captured do not need to be recorded truthfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the \"September 1st\" principle, only one-tenth of the prisoners of war in the transnational pacification of chaos are counted, and they are still the worst one-tenth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the other 90%, Hudson still didn't eat alone, and still divided up according to the old rules. It's nothing more than the number on the account, so \"billion lost\" is missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp of the Southeastern Front Army quickly became lively. From the various cries, it can be seen that these sellers are not qualified slave traders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom lacks labor force, but it does not mean that all noble territories lack labor force. The aristocratic territories of the Southeast Front Army are all in the south. Except for a few unlucky ones who were affected by the rioters, most of the aristocratic territories suffered little population loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For noble lords, the extra population is also a burden. It is also a matter of course to take it out for trading.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just judging from the situation on the spot, it seems that they are not so optimistic, and the transaction rate is pitifully low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was caused by the price. Hudson also sent people to visit the market. The price of prisoners of war was generally more than twice the price of normal slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to mark such a sky-high price, the seller is obviously not selling in good faith. It is estimated that each of them is still thinking about the issue of the fief, imagining that they are lucky enough to just get a large fief, and a lot of manpower is still needed for development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that they are selling it, the only reason left is to tell them that the loss of the kingdom this time is not big, and there are not so many radishes pitted out. Leaving a large number of prisoners of war will only waste their precious food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can get a fiefdom, there is a high probability that it will be the Northern Xinjiang that everyone hates. Many people have no idea whether to want this kind of dilapidated enclave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, they dislike the dangers of northern Xinjiang, on the other hand, they still have a little fantasy, in case the human race alliance really wipes out the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driven by such complicated thoughts, the price of prisoners of war was quickly pushed to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are only a few people who are taken advantage of. After this war, most of the nobles in the country are not very rich and cannot afford such sky-high prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the freedom of all nobles to dispose of their own wealth. It is not something that Hudson can interfere with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the biggest beneficiary of this war, Hudson received a total of 80,000 prisoners of war, plus the 20,000 previously privately embezzled, the population of the Mountain Territory + 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The doubling of population growth is also putting a lot of pressure on the territory. The employment problem is easy to solve, just send them off to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem is food. If it weren't for the money in Hudson's pocket, he really couldn't afford to support so many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with three times the price of food before the war, it is not something ordinary people can afford. Don't look at the fact that a large number of nobles are holding a large number of people in their hands, and it will definitely flow to the market in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the nobles of the Southeast Front Army all returned from the Moxi Principality to make a fortune, but most of them have a pile of war bonds in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the coach Hudson, there are very few nobles in the army who hold a lot of cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that bonds have high interest rates, but they can only be officially redeemed after the settlement period. Even if it is the interest income that is settled once a year, it will take time to go to the Principality of Moxi to pay it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To use war bonds as gold coins, someone has to dare to accept them. Although the war bond is not registered, it is not anyone who holds it in their hands and can be honored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is looking for a successor, and it will be even more difficult for the ignorant and ignorant little nobles below to realize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the people below deal with the prisoners of war in their hands as soon as possible. The army will go north in twenty days.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is already the limit that Hudson can drag. If the delay is too long, it will be difficult for the king to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to deal with so many prisoners of war in such a short period of time is also a test for the little nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of competition is about personal connections. Those with a strong background, as long as they send someone to **** the prisoners of war, the nobles along the way will provide logistical supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be embarrassing if the network cannot keep up. Not only have to send more soldiers to escort, but also face blackmail from local snakes along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to deliberately make things difficult, just raising the price of supplies is enough to make them bleed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, the most unlucky must be the northern nobles in the army. Other nobles can find a few relatives and friends if they seek connections; if they report their families, they will most likely find a group of enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The culprits are the five major families in the north. Those who mixed with the five major families can be regarded as accomplices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, it is undoubtedly a wise choice for Sith to run away decisively after the day is confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you suffer. If you don't suffer, how do these people know the importance of holding Master Hudson's thigh tightly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, the Northern Expeditionary Army buried in their journey, finally collided with the orc army returning home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two armies confronted each other directly on the vast prairie. No one launched an attack rashly, as if it was a breath competition before the duel between the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell's face is very ugly, the enemy is coming too fast, this is not a good place to set up camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting the enemy on the vast prairie, whether it is to move forward or retreat strategically, is not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one day left before he can arrive at his preset battlefield. It's a pity that the orc cavalry came too fast, blocking the way of the Beizheng army in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commanding the army to kill the past seems to be a good choice, but it is actually not feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Infantry cannot catch up with cavalry, and it is cavalry that can confront cavalry. It seems that the number of cavalry on both sides is almost the same, but the innate physical fitness of the human cavalry is inferior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are more than a dozen knights in hand, the gap in strength between the cavalry of the two sides cannot be reversed. If you can't win, you can't take the initiative to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, are you just spending time with the enemy like this?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked unwillingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here with the orcs, other nobles can be stable, but he can't. Getting Hudson back to the country to hide in the snow seemed to be a success, but now it has become a failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson continues to serve as the commander of the coalition forces in the Principality of Moxi, he can still urge the other party to send troops immediately, so don't think about it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people also have their own interests. Being able to send troops to rescue is to save face. If you want to expect speed, that is too embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was the one who took the lead in the matter, so naturally he should bear the responsibility. The cynicism in the eyes of the political opponents put Earl Pierce under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if he wins the battle easily, everything will be gone with the wind; if everyone suffers heavy losses, he will be the target of everyone's anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even before taking action, all the great nobles recognized it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, calm down first. Besides fighting the enemy here, do you think we have a better choice?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting the enemy in this scene, there is no better choice for anyone to take his position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the current competition is hard power, and any strategy and tactics are based on the opponent's mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's just that the enemy's army is still on the way, and it's just that the cavalry is coming to block the door. Even if he is full of strategies, there is no room for him to display them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being \"resentful\", Earl Pierce quickly calmed down. Standing still and not knowing what will happen next, but taking the initiative to attack is bound to cause heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom's fortunes are all here, once the battle is defeated, all will be lost. This kind of risk is not something everyone can afford.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps feeling that the tone just now was too strong, and it hurt the morale of the army, Marshal Campbell then added: \"Don't worry, Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom has already taken action. The original expeditionary force to aid the Moxi Principality has been reorganized into the Southeast Front Army, and will soon go to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also reached an agreement with the Moxi people. Now that it is time for them to pay back their favors, they will come to reinforce them together after the alliance reinforcements have rested for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two reinforcements converged, and the offensive and defensive momentum was reversed. We just need to wait now, and after two months at most, it will be our turn to counterattack again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the reassuring words came out, the faces of the high-ranking members of the Northern Expeditionary Army nearby looked a lot better. Only Earl Pierce's face became more and more gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his gloomy face, there is also Duke Pias. The momentary negligence back then did not expect that the Koslow family would become popular again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are only hanging out in the circle of small and medium aristocrats, Duke Pias doesn't care. The Lochnard family still has a lot of such low-level enemies, and they can't be liquidated at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once you step into the threshold of the great aristocracy, it will be different. This kind of enemy may be able to deal them a fatal blow at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the potential conflict of interest between the Koslow family and the Dalton family, the Locknard family is the real feud between the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't take direct action, that's because there was no chance to find a one-hit kill. In order to interrupt the rise of the Koslow family, he did not hesitate to reconcile with the Dalton family who had conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Earl Pierce is not a fuel-efficient lamp. Even if he takes action to suppress the Koslow family, it is still a political means, and there is no silly direct confrontation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no blood on each other, and the conflict between the two families is still a potential conflict of interest, and has not yet escalated to the stage of blood feud that will never die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Hudson gets a high position in the army, the Locknard family is in a far more dangerous situation than the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you toss, within the rules of the game, it is not convenient for everyone to directly start a war of extermination. Most of the methods adopted are killing people with borrowed knives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family is in the southeast of the kingdom, so they hardly have to worry about foreign enemies; the Locknard family in the north is different, and the orcs are the best knives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Northern Expeditionary Army was blocked, but how to deal with it became a problem again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to defeat the enemy, but the difficulty is how to defeat the enemy in a short time, and also to ensure that one's own strength does not suffer too much loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the situation, the five imperial courts couldn't even take care of their internal struggles. Originally, I wanted to seek an explanation from the Beamon family, but now I have no choice but to cancel it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only change is: the Beamon family has dropped from the head of the five royal families to the end. This was proposed by the new Beamon Emperor Alex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. In the previous battle of the imperial courts, the strength of the Beamon family was greatly damaged, and they could no longer hold down the other four imperial courts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than being bombarded by others, it is better to give in. What's more, this time the old Bi Menghuang made too much trouble, and he also needs to appease the other four imperial courts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is a bit bad. Many big tribes have moved, as if they are deliberately avoiding us, and they probably noticed something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past ten days, accidents have happened to the people we sent out. Originally thought that the human race did it, but judging from the current situation, there are also black hands of these big tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court's call-up order is no longer taken seriously by them. It depends on the situation that they are going to wait for us to fight with the human race before jumping out to take advantage of it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ying Renhuang said with a livid face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire was originally a mixed bag of good and bad people, all bearing the name of orcs in name, but in fact they belonged to various races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the five imperial courts was greatly damaged, and the younger brothers under him immediately couldn't help it. Jumping out in such a hurry is not because these tribes are impatient, but because the hands of the five royal families are too dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accept the call honestly, your next fate is to be slowly consumed in the confrontation with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thousands of years, every time the two clans fought, it was the time when the tribes below were unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless powerful races were sent to the battlefield as cannon fodder, and the brutal rule of the five royal families was able to stand firm forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was obvious that everyone had had enough, and when they saw an opportunity to break free from the rule of the five royal families, they immediately took action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the five imperial courts have accumulated power for too long after all, and the choice everyone made was to avoid it, not to confront it head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these tribes dared to bet, they would take advantage of the opportunity of the main forces of the five royal families to go out and slaughter their tribes, and they would definitely be able to pull them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex was very embarrassed, this is his own fault again. It's nothing more than a defeat, but even the cannon fodder troops under his command were not consumed in time, and they were digging holes and laying mines properly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is a conspiracy of the human race. It is difficult to defeat us head-on, so they are trying to divide the empire from the inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can't sit still, we must take a fierce counterattack to let the enemy know how powerful it is! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex tried his best to throw the blame away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meet a father who professionally cheats his son, there is only so much he can do now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's forget about the part that cannot be cleared up. For these uncertain charges, you can push it away if you can, and throw it away if you can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex, don't be so excited. There must be a counterattack, but you must carefully consider where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is not about how many human soldiers we kill, but about stabilizing the orc empire first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The currently changing tribes are only part of the orc race. If this situation continues, more large tribes will follow suit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed until now, and the five royal families have all suffered heavy losses, but relatively speaking, the lion clan suffered the least damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous important battles, the lion tribe did not come out to gain a sense of presence, and correspondingly there was not much loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of luck against the sky is really the envy of the other four royal families. It's a pity that envy can't change the fact that the lion people's voice in the orc empire has greatly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the lack of convincing achievements, it would be the Lion King's turn to be the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It stands to reason that the Lion King at this moment should fight vigorously in order to eliminate the exploits of the Alpha Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army and lay the foundation for his ascent to the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is obviously not the case. It is by nature to be warlike, but it does not mean that the Lion King lacks political acumen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human army is to fight, but it is obviously more important to stabilize the rear. It is true that the human race and the orcs have a deep hatred, but it does not mean that the two sides cannot cooperate in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the unstable elements within the orc empire hook up with the human race, it will be the end of their five races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, what the human race cannot tolerate is \"a powerful orc empire\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the various races can stand on their own and disintegrate the orc empire from within, they will lose the value of being suppressed by the human race alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, the following small clans may compromise with the human race, but the five royal clans cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the prairie, the two armies are still facing each other. It was as if the arrival of the orc army had no effect on the battlefield at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"surround but not attack\" of only encircling one side still made Marshal Campbell feel the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, as time goes by, more and more orc cannon fodder troops have gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs have divided their forces, are you sure you read it correctly?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the Northern Expedition Army is not weak, and its comprehensive strength is at least 60% of that of the orc army. If you dare to separate your troops and leave, who do you look down upon?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, don't worry, we sent people to verify this information three times, and asked the investigating soldiers to record it with photo stones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, at least 80,000 orcs left the orc army. Judging from the direction of action of the enemy army, it should be returning to the old nest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps something happened in the rear of the orc empire, so they had to divide their troops back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the middle-aged officer made Marshal Campbell even more confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accidents happened in the rear of the Orc Empire, this is completely a super-class topic. Nothing like it has been seen in the past hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though they knew that the Orc Empire had many internal conflicts, in the past countless years, no major disturbances occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experienced commanders are often bound by rich experience. When encountering such an accident, the first reaction of Marshal Campbell is to be more vigilant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order and let all the troops be more vigilant. Immediately slaughter the animals and leave the precious fodder for the horses. We must be prepared for a long confrontation with the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people to watch the whereabouts of the orc team, and find out their real purpose as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the spring, the southeast front army embarked on the journey again. Logically speaking, the Southeast Front Army has been fighting continuously for more than a year, and it is time to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are exceptions to everything. The situation in the kingdom is critical, and the southeast front army is playing the role of rescuers. Naturally, they cannot go back to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army advanced all the way, and the team became stronger and stronger. Caesar III once again issued a mobilization order, including the Fengyun Province, which was seriously injured, and the seven provinces in the southeastern part of the kingdom were all within the scope of recruitment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deal with the problem of prisoners of war, there was a delay for a while, and the mobilization of the provinces was almost completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, the 14 legions mobilized from the seven southeastern provinces were assigned to the southeastern front army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troop strength +140,000, Hudson didn't feel happy at all. His intuition told him that this was just the beginning, and more mobs would be assigned to his command in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest difference between a large number of soldiers and a small number of soldiers is that the former is a waste of a commander if he loses a battle, while the latter is understandable if he loses a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is asked to reorganize the defense line, then these serf soldiers who have only received simple military training can still make do with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you expect him to lead the army and run to rescue the Northern Expedition army, it is purely cheating people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can only hope that those guys in the capital are not over-the-top and give an idiot order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of concern about the next situation, Hudson decisively chose to play badly. In addition to rectifying military discipline, he is letting his own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expanded Southeast Front Army, in terms of marching speed, fully interpreted the mob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traveling fifty miles or sixty miles a day is already a thing of the past. The current southeast front army has directly halved its marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The snail-like forward speed, if it was left in the past, Hudson would have let the supervising team kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, just slow down. Best to arrive at the front line just as the first Alliance reinforcements arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Northern Expeditionary Army still fails to break through, then the problem will not be too big after joining forces to clear the siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the front line is unfortunately defeated, Hudson can only admit it. He wanted to protect the family property for the kingdom, but his own strength did not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the king's envoy is here again.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the word \"again\", Hudson's scalp tingled. Now he is upset when he sees Earl Lauren, and that guy will urge, urge, urge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Lauren, please come in!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how upset you are, you still have to see people. He represents the king, and he directly shuts people out. Hudson is not so \"brave\" yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III was not easy to bully. Once he was offended, his methods against people were not ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many nobles in the kingdom, all of them lost their temper. There are countless tragic cases out there, and Hudson is not willing to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, I have brought new orders from His Majesty the Great Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, the Southeast Front Army will be reorganized into the South Central Front Army, and you will be the commander-in-chief, responsible for the unified command of the new armies in the central and southern provinces of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Announced the king's new order. Seeing that Hudson did not respond, Earl Lauren couldn't help reminding: \"Earl Hudson, look?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look, look at a ghost!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the newly mobilized legions are all garbage troops that are at the bottom of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who gave Caesar III the confidence to think that he can command so many mobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hundreds of thousands of mobs in the seven southeastern provinces alone are enough to make him go bad, and now there are more than 200,000 people, are they going to let people live?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Lauren, please tell His Majesty the King for me: Hudson's ability is limited, and he doesn't have the ability to command the South Central Front Army. Please choose someone else!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sincerity of the tone made Earl Lauren stunned. It's not that there are no commanders who dislike too many soldiers, but there are really not many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last time, Hudson was not very interested in drawing the troops from the southeastern provinces over, but he finally accepted it, and this time he refused directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, please don't say that! The situation in the kingdom is difficult, and we need a good general like you to contribute to the country.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. As a king, the most important thing is to play with balance. Originally, Caesar III did not plan to hand over so many troops to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commanders-in-chief of the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army were respectively appointed in front of them. Unfortunately, those two were really ineffective, and there was a big disturbance on the road as soon as they set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Soldiers pass like grates\" is not a joke. In particular, the destructive power of the mob army is even more astonishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident. Both the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army have proved the destructive power of the mob with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only southeast front army that had no problems suddenly seemed to stand out from the crowd. In stark contrast, Caesar III immediately decided to make a substitution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military discipline of the new regiment is terrible. In addition to lack of training, there is another important reason-the serious lack of qualified officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other words, there are not enough capable noble children. The rest are a bunch of dandies who are now forcibly conscripted into the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of useless officers and a group of mob soldiers staged the tragedy of \"soldiers passing like grates\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family members of many nobles were brutally poisoned by the rebels. Do you know that these nobles are still fighting on the front line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could the kingdom sit idly by when such a major event happened. As the commander who is directly responsible, he will naturally be dismissed directly, and the parties involved in the riot must also be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some tossing, the position was freed up. Knowing that it was a mess, all the bigwigs in the capital naturally gave way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I really have no choice!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Lauren was about to cry. This matter is really not his responsibility, and he resolutely refuses to accept it, and he, the king's special envoy, can do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of things to catch ducks on the shelves, but it would be very nonsense to forcefully appoint a military commander when others refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead, Caesar III didn't know what to say for a while, and the atmosphere in the room became extraordinarily weird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, military commanders are always needed. Knowing that it is a mess, no one is willing to take over, which is embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former Southwest Front Army and Central Front Army appointed coaches who were all veterans of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lessons learned from the past are there, and capable noble officers are naturally unwilling to jump into the pit.

Now suddenly found that the problem is not balanced or unbalanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army are purely two hot potatoes. If it weren't for the fact that the kingdom had no soldiers available, Caesar III wouldn't have even glanced at this kind of rubbish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly the sequelae of blind optimism. The capable noble children all went to the Northern Expedition Army to gain military exploits, and what remained were those who failed to succeed and failed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, although the Earl of Hudson has rejected the position of commander, we can let him take charge of the troops first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among all the generals in the kingdom, he is the one who can grasp military discipline the best. The soldiers under his command are the most law-abiding, and they will not leave the barracks without a military order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army, this kind of strict military commander is needed to reverse the unhealthy trend in the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military Affairs Minister Effierro said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone has to pick up the hot potato. Hudson, who has strong ability, excellent performance and no identity background, is undoubtedly the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lauren, how did the Earl of Hudson run the army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an ordinary difficulty to pull a team that is rotten from top to bottom out of the quagmire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous commander did not fail to take measures, but unfortunately he failed in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I don't know exactly how the Earl of Hudson manages the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in the southeast front army camp, I heard bursts of wailing, which should be the screams of soldiers who violated military discipline being punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the strict military discipline of the Southeast Front Army was forged by strict military law constraints. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Lauren said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This answer does not satisfy everyone. No matter how strict the military law is, someone must enforce it. After the military officers were also corrupted, no matter how strict the military law was, it was just a display.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't know, then send someone over there to learn. The Ministry of Military Affairs, hurry up and arrange for the competent people to go over there. There is no need to add trouble to those crooked melons and cracked dates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lauren, make another trip and make sure Earl Hudson takes over the Southwest and Central Fronts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to let these two troops move closer to the southeast front army. Next, I don't want to hear any more bad news! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III ordered angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Moxi, Crown Prince George warmly welcomed the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance. To be exact, this welcoming activity has lasted for half a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, there are too many forces within the Human Race Alliance, and there are still conflicts among them. It is too embarrassing for them to arrive together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, Blake, head of the Holy See Judgment Knights, is here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the attendant said shocked everyone. Even after hundreds of years, the resounding name of the Knights of Judgment is still a shadow in the hearts of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from ordinary knights, the Judgment Knights have long been transformed into a hodgepodge. There are not only knights who run on the ground, but also knights who fly in the sky, and even the navy has an establishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant that gathers the three armed forces of land, sea and air has a total strength of 80,000. In terms of military strength, it is somewhat stronger than many countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the Judgment Knights personally led the team, which is enough to prove that the Holy See attaches great importance to this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earth-moving dragon army, which made a shocking appearance, gave people the feeling of shaking the earth from a distance, and the huge body could tell that it was not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seemingly dissatisfied with being robbed of the limelight by the ground dragon army, the flying dragon in the sky gave out a dragon roar, and instantly grabbed everyone's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ordinary cavalrymen who ran into two teams pretending to be aggressive, seemed to be overshadowed. Even if they are the elite among the elite, they become inconspicuous in front of extraordinary arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go, go and meet!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as George finished speaking, a new team appeared in the sky. The same huge body came towards everyone like a mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a new dragon chant in the sky, the sound was slightly different from the previous flying dragons, but it didn't affect their domineering appearance in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No need to wait for his subordinates to report, just look at the lineup George knows that this is the Tyrannosaurus Rex Legion and Pterosaur Cavalry of the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to confront the Holy See so **** for tat, they are the only countries in the mainland. However, compared with declaring the pope illegal, this small target is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two major forces are competing, which is a pain for Prince George. They are all the top forces in the human race, and the family can't afford to offend them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two families collided, and the reception became a big problem. At the same time, there is no way to welcome two people. If one family is greeted first, it is bound to offend the other family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he was more inclined to the Frankish kingdom in his heart, George really didn't know what to do if the Duke of Mosi, who was seriously injured, was involved in this camp battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's really lively, so how about adding me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hearty voice descended from the sky, and the embarrassed George was instantly overjoyed. The two strong oppositions are blended in, and if you are not careful, you will be smashed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it has become a tripartite confrontation, and the situation is instantly different. The emergence of the Kingdom of Iberia temporarily put an end to this struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giant Eagle Cavalry, Vulture Cavalry, Griffin Cavalry, a proper air force grocery, but unfortunately it is still not as shocking as the previous \"Dragon Species\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Velociraptor Legion on the ground is not inferior to the previous two. The size is slightly smaller, but the advantage is that it is more flexible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second most powerful country in the mainland, Iberia also deserves its name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The confrontation between the top three really made everyone watch a good show. The rest of the reinforcements from all walks of life became low-key one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with these three giants, other human forces, although they also have good strength, are still much inferior in general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three major forces each sent 30,000 troops, accounting for 30% of all the reinforcements, but the combat power accounted for far more than half, and they were properly responsible for force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the camp of the Southeastern Front Army, Hudson once again ushered in an uninvited guest. He really has no temper for this group of nobles who came to learn how to govern the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era of strict confidentiality of knowledge, Hudson didn't know how to complain about stealing teachers so openly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already greeted Caesar III's family many times, but on the surface he had to warmly receive all the guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the great nobles in the kingdom have sent representatives, and he really can't afford to offend him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the looming jealous eyes in the crowd, Hudson knew that Caesar III had brought him a wave of hatred this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just refusing to be the commander-in-chief, so why are you so narrow-minded?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it, Hudson still joined everyone else in praising His Majesty the King for his wisdom. I really can't afford to be offended, there are too many ways for the boss to wear shoes for the younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happy for a while, but tragic for the rest of my life. Especially for a quasi-big aristocrat like Hudson whose fiefdom has not yet been settled, he can't afford to offend the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to save face, but it's still impossible to want him to jump into the pit. Acting military command, what is the difference between that and being the head coach?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't you all want to learn, then follow along. How much you can learn depends on your ability, anyway, Hudson will not take the initiative to teach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading troops to fight mainly depends on talent. If it doesn't work, it really doesn't work. No matter how many military books you read and how many military strategies you learn, you still can't change the essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is veterans who are cultivated by experience, not titans. The mass-produced ones can only be grass-roots officers, not \"famous generals\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, where do you put the dignity of the nobles when you run the army like this?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the misfit sounded, and Hudson knew that the kicker was coming. It was a group of N-generation nobles who were hit by the board now, and they happened to be bumped into by the study and observation group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strict military discipline also requires a price. Most of them are mobs of the southeast front army, and the price of being able to do nothing to the civilians is the buttocks of a group of noble N generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The operation is very simple, if you are restless, drag it out and beat it, and beat it in front of the soldiers under your command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not convinced after one meal, you can have another meal. Anyway, if you are dawdling in the southeast front army, it is enough for the board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the wailing in the barracks was contributed by the uneasy N generation officers. As for the serf soldiers below, how can they not know how to behave when their own masters have been punished?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally there are unbelievers whose heads are still hanging on the flagpole outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One counts as one, and Hudson has never been soft when dealing with people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't cut off the heads of the noble officers, but just beat them up. That's because he saved face for the families behind these guys, and it's ridiculous to talk about the dignity of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A group of guys without aristocratic qualities is a complete disgrace among the nobles, and they are not worthy of noble dignity. Do you think there is a problem?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While asking back, Hudson's sharp eyes also locked on the young nobleman. An invisible pressure made him take three steps back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to say something, but unfortunately, my morale was exhausted. The words came to his lips, but in the end he became hesitant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brief confrontation was won, and Hudson was not at all happy. It's not that the quality of the nobles is not good, but that the quality of the nobles who play the game is not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple, the elite of the younger generation are on the front line. Those who stay in the country are either determined to have no military talent, or they are the masters who eat and wait to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a very few, because they were seriously injured in the previous battle and had to stay for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that someone jumped out to make trouble so quickly is enough to prove that many people in the kingdom do not welcome him, a new player, to enter the arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made him too young?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone really couldn't tolerate it: a guy who was younger than himself and from a worse background than himself was pressing on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This will make them very embarrassed, and the original excuse will not work. Failure to jump up is due to one's own incompetence, not caused by various special objective conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most of the younger generation, children from other people's families like Hudson are both their own role models and a nuisance that pulls them back to reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young bird just now, the accent seems to come from the Northland. Vaguely, Hudson seemed to understand the origin of this hostility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As for whether he has learned it or has lost it, Hudson is not clear about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is strictly governed, and it is all-round. It's not that dragging the noble officer out to slap a few boards will solve all the problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to apply rote, you must first consider whether your fist is hard enough, and whether you can suppress the collective rebound of the noble officers under your command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was able to play so roughly without causing waves, because he had tens of thousands of elite troops following him first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the noble officers below had resentment, they could only hold it back. If you want to join together to do things, you can't gather so many fools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playboys are best at eating, drinking and having fun, not plotting rebellion. It is their instinct to bully the weak and fear the strong. When they meet a strong commander like Hudson, they will naturally not be able to toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off the study group, Hudson began to recall the history of the Koslow family. His intuition told him that the hostility towards him from the noble children of the Northern Lands stemmed from the family, not from him as a good nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From birth to the present, Hudson has been dawdling in the south. The only time he went out was to help fight the war in the Principality of Moxi. He had no chance to make enemies with the big men in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can barely get involved is to drive away the hapless Sis. The man ran by himself, and Hudson didn't even make a direct shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An illegitimate child who is not recognized by the family, even if it is killed directly, the Felix family will not take it seriously, at most it will have an enmity with the Duke of Cavadia himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the elimination method, there is only one target left, the feud of the Koslow family—the Locknard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it was just the wishful thinking of the members of the Koslow family. Lochnard might not even know that he still has this low-level enemy outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, it should be that with Hudson's strong rise, the opponent's memory has gradually been awakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the representative sent here is really not very smart. Even if you do something, you have to catch a fatal handle, and then kill him with one blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too underestimating for someone to foolishly talk about the dignity of the nobles and try to provoke the hostility of the entire noble group towards Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, this is still a contradiction within the noble group. It's just a beating, and the family behind him has no objections, so it's not the turn of outsiders to make irresponsible remarks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No orthodox aristocrat likes dudes. If someone helps educate them, the sensible ones will only be grateful. If you don't wake up in advance, if you really get to the battlefield, you will have to pay the price in blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to being punished, negligent discipline leads to the death of a large number of noble officers under his command, which is the real hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Revenge\" is necessary, but Hudson is at a loss as to how to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the Lochnard family is mixed with the main force of the kingdom, even if he wants to play a black hand, there is no room for him to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't kill the main force of the kingdom together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no eggs in the nest, and without the big tree of the Alpha Kingdom to shelter from the wind and rain, how can Master Hudson accumulate strength?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, both the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army have sent representatives, do you see?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom's words made Hudson frown. Even if he leads troops to fight, he can't say \"not here\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting each other means trouble is coming. Caesar III ordered him to take charge of the three armies early on, and he couldn't push it away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are not capable, you can step down when a suitable person takes over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, this is not a human language at all. If there is a more suitable candidate in the kingdom, Caesar III is crazy to let him take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is, it is still in the army of the Northern Expedition. Ninety-nine percent of the generals of the Alpha Kingdom have gone to the Northern Expedition Army and are busy confronting the orcs at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Take them to the camp and wait, I will go there later.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't shake off the plaster, you can only take it on the road first. Anyway, with the two unlucky guys in front of it, no matter how bad it is, it won't be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, slow down the marching speed, as long as there is no major disturbance on the road, then you can explain to all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the front line, if the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance don't arrive for a day, he will stick to the defense line for a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless cases have proved that cannon fodder troops can also bring trouble to the orc army in the process of defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure is death. In the face of life and death, the potential of people can be most stimulated. If you are in a hurry, the dude can also work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Emerald Palace forced the army to Hudson, and Caesar III was actually beating drums in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But remembering that the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance had arrived, this worry was quickly dispelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on past record analysis, he has long come to the conclusion that Hudson is best at fighting with the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Battle against the wind does not exist. The large and small battles Hudson launched were all military operations when he had the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult for a general of this cautious type to suffer defeat on the battlefield. Because when he can't win, he won't fight the enemy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Allied forces, where are you now, and how long will it take to reach the front line?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the front line has begun to change. After gathering enough cannon fodder, the orc army launched a fierce attack on the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the Northern Expeditionary Army can still hold on. It's hard to say if it lasts for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the orc army at this moment launched a strong attack purely to cleanse unstable factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many newly arrived tribes were forcibly invited to the front line by the five royal families using troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The first batch of alliance reinforcements have already joined forces in the Principality of Moxi. It's just that the people of the Holy See and the Kingdom of Franks are fighting, and the Kingdom of Iberia has also intervened. The situation is very delicate.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance broke out internal disputes at this juncture, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also very helpless. No matter how hard they try, they can't resist someone deliberately holding back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it was just a dispute between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Franks, and the Kingdom of Iberia was in charge of persuading the fight, but the persuasion and persuasion turned into three families complaining about each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stable quarrel triangle greatly delayed the decision-making efficiency of the Allies. Most of the time is wasted on meaningless quarrels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn the Holy See, they really linger!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III couldn't help cursing angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no evidence, his intuition tells him that this dispute was deliberately provoked by the Holy See in order to hold them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Franks and the Kingdom of Iberia can naturally see such an obvious way of playing, but they are still willing to cooperate, which is also enough to explain a lot of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by interests. From the standpoint of the two countries, they need an Alpha Kingdom that is firmly anti-Holy See, but this Alpha Kingdom cannot be too strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delaying the rescue time, playing with borrowing a knife to kill people, and taking the opportunity to weaken the strength of the Alpha Kingdom are all good choices for the three parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come on, the trapped soldiers are all your own soldiers, so you have to try your best to rescue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The alliance's reinforcements can only deter the enemy, and are unreliable at critical moments. What do you think, don't you expect the Earl of Hudson to lead troops to rescue?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Caesar III said made everyone very embarrassed. Hundreds of thousands of troops appeared behind the orc army, even if it was just a cannon fodder army, it would be able to disperse the enemy's forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With cannon fodder blocking, the main force of the trapped kingdom is very hopeful to break out. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the strategy of sacrificing the cannon fodder troops in exchange for the safe return of the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is how to safely send hundreds of thousands of cannon fodder to the back of the orc army. If he was defeated by the orc cavalry just halfway, it would be a loss for his wife and a loss of soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the most powerful army in the kingdom is in the hands of Earl Hudson. It is the only hope to give the army a chance to retreat safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in terms of specific implementation, there are still many problems. Everyone has seen the quality of the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army, and it is estimated that the new regiments in the Southeast Front Army are not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them are mobs. If they fight directly with the orc army, they will be defeated at the first touch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is not to fight the enemy, and force the orcs to withdraw by intimidation or other means. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Scare\" the orcs is purely an ideal state. Unless the hundreds of thousands of cannon fodder in Hudson's hands are all turned into real elites, it will have no effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is really feasible is \"other methods\", but the problems involved are a bit big, and Grand Duke Effierro dared not speak out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you think so too?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III frowned and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the orcs to release people without paying a price. At this juncture, there is a high probability that the conditions proposed by the orcs will be related to the liquidation of the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally waiting for an opportunity to seriously injure or even destroy the Orc Empire, Caesar III really didn't want to just give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if there is no other way, I can only try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are constant disputes within the alliance. Even if we insist on destroying the orc empire, most of them will end without a problem in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc empire cannot be completely destroyed, then the sacrifice of the kingdom is meaningless, it is better to preserve its strength first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the five royal families of the orcs, the Beamon family suffered heavy losses, and their population was almost halved. Other ethnic groups also suffered a lot of casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, decades of peace were won for the northern border of the kingdom. Now our loss is not too big, and the recovery speed should be faster than that of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the kingdom has recovered and regained its vitality, it will not be too late to send troops to conquer the orc empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, replied nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compromise is not what he wants, but it is more important to preserve strength. The infighting of the Terran Alliance has chilled the hearts of the Grand Duke of Newfoundland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with destroying the orc empire, as a member of the royal family, he values ​​the interests of the royal family more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha royal family was able to come out of the decline because it met the hero Caesar III.

From the initial 20 miles a day, it slowly increased to 25 miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been proved by practical actions that the Earl of Hudson loves the kingdom and is throwing his head and blood for the cause of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, except for a little trouble in the first few days, the following days were all peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a price, there are often wailing and screams in the army. There is no way, no matter how strict military discipline is, it is inevitable that someone will try their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson could only extend the joint sitting system to officers, and made noble officers supervise each other. If you don't report it in time, then your **** will bloom together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military chaplain watched from the sidelines, making sure that no one would be killed. Then there is no matter how painful, how to toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the younger brothers who follow these dandy officers to do things, they naturally accompany the noble lord the whole time. The difference is that they only leave their heads to accompany them, and their lower bodies have been made into fertilizer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pain was already unbearable, and I had to bump around in the open-air carriage. The most embarrassing thing was that the carriage was accompanied by a human head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those dandies with many younger brothers, who lie on their heads all over. The terrifying and frightening scene is enough to make them unforgettable for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is cruel. Cut off the heads of these people, and none of them will be wronged. The playboys are causing trouble everywhere, and the \"doglegs\" around him have contributed at least half of the \"performance\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a person with vested interests, if you can't break the rules that are beneficial to you, you can only wrong these \"dog legs\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the efforts of these people were not in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the lessons learned from the past, the dandy servants who escaped the catastrophe are all extraordinarily well-behaved\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dandy military advisers who originally advised us have now become the main force to dissuade them from keeping their own place. I'm afraid that my master will cause trouble and lose my life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Settle down, that is hello, me, hello, everyone. The army advanced smoothly all the way, except that the speed was so slow that it was \"billion points\", and there were no major problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the advance speed of the army, it continues to increase every day, although the increase is not much each time, which also proves that Hudson is good at managing the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle of not using resources in vain, Hudson vigorously promoted his cronies in the army, taking his own people as key positions for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military positions are temporary and do not account for the official establishment of the Kingdom's army. The excuse is also readily available, to rectify military discipline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on what the Southwest Front Army and the Central Front Army had previously revealed, Hudson, the acting coach, wanted to rectify military discipline, and no one could say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of combined punches, finally barely achieved the prohibition. As for other aspects, Hudson can't care so much for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dawdling along the way, stop and go, the army has arrived in the Northland, and the reinforcements of the Terran Alliance are still dawdling on the road, which makes Hudson very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going forward, we will enter the newly recovered provinces. The defense line here is broken, and repairs can be made to make do with it anyway. At most, the remains of the ancient battlefield can be found in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, and the whole army will stop. Stationed on the spot, repair the city defense fortifications, and rebuild the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to notify the kingdom, and let His Majesty the King send a good general to command the entire army, and urge the alliance's reinforcements by the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going forward, whoever has the guts will go. Anyway, he didn't dare to bring a group of rabble to collide with the orc army in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building a defense line on the spot to resist a possible outbreak of orc invasion is already a manifestation of responsibility to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is suffering, and the orc army is also gloomy. A large number of cannon fodder troops were thrown into the battlefield. Although it was to attack the besieged Northern Expeditionary Army, it also aroused resistance from more tribes in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, everyone just moved to avoid the recruitment of the five royal families, but now it has directly developed to the place of armed confrontation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Unwilling to be cannon fodder on the battlefield, the orc tribes actually united to separate one side within the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this new separatist force is very deceptive, and soon attracted countless tribes to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an inevitable result, the world's orcs have suffered for a long time! Raise your arms and call out, naturally there are many responders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foreign enemies have not been wiped out, internal conflicts have intensified, and the Orc Empire is also in an embarrassing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Between \"fighting against the outside world\" and \"safety inside\", there is always a trade-off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Alpha Kingdom sent a message, wanting us to let their army leave.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hostility is hostility, and the high-level officials of both parties still keep contact information in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The various smuggling activities in the past seemed to be the greed of the people below, but in fact it was a tacit understanding reached by the high-level leaders of both parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the original five royal families, this secret contact method has always remained in the hands of the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alpha people are crazy! They said to let people go, so we have to let people go, why?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a painful price to get an opportunity to retain the main force of the Alpha Kingdom. How could you give up just because of the enemy's request!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just because the human race is powerful now, we are weak!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance, they are coming in a steady stream, but what we have are endless rebellions! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor sneered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war was first provoked by him by agitation, but now he has turned into a peace faction, and everything is caused by interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he failed to build up enough prestige with the help of this war, he succeeded in eliminating dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losses of the lion tribe in the war were small, and the ones who died were all the masters who did not deal with him. Now that the war is over as soon as it is good, the Lion Emperor naturally has no pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's easy to let the enemy go, but the trouble is how can we guarantee that the human race will end this war immediately?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom could be the leader of the Human Race Alliance, the empire would have been destroyed ten times long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the past, this time the Terran Alliance clamored to launch a war of extermination. As the overlord of the mainland, you can't just talk but don't practice! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, apart from strength, the most important thing is to keep one promise. If the words don't count too many times, who will take the overlord's words to heart in the future!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves whether the hegemony of the human race is stable, and it is obviously not an easy task to get the other party to take back what they said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the human race alliance, even whether the Alpha Kingdom itself will abide by the agreement is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy's army is sent back, the other party will turn their backs and deny them, and turn around and attack them again, that would be a real tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Actually, there is no way to guarantee the other party's performance of the contract, for example: invite a race that the Alpha Kingdom can't afford to mess with as a guarantee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, when it comes to the entire human race alliance, one race may not be able to deter them. It is best to bring together all ethnic groups in the mainland and sit down to negotiate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Alex finished speaking, the \"Dragon Clan\" appeared in the minds of several emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one that makes the Alpha Kingdom not dare to break the contract and has a certain deterrent effect on the human race is the Dragon Race, which is rich in superpowers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For ordinary people, the dragon family is the endorsement of power and mystery, but for the high-level people of various races, the dragon family is mainly powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the oldest continental overlords, the Dragon Clan has long migrated out of the Aslante Continent and returned to its old nest—\"Dragon Island\", or the Dragon's Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of clansmen evacuate, and occasionally a few restless dragons escape, which can also disturb the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the dragon clan, all the clans in the mainland have only one word—\"headache\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon slayer warriors sound majestic, but the truth is that 9,999.9 out of 10,000 dragon slayers have become snacks for evil dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less than 1/100,000 successful dragon slayers are left. While enjoying the success and fame, they must also be prepared to face the dragon's revenge at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect a big force to provide shelter. Encountering an enemy with super fighting power like the Dragon Clan who comes and goes without a trace, any force will only have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the giant dragon becomes a rogue, there will be nothing wrong with the human race. The scene of a group of giant dragons attacking guerrillas everywhere, just think about the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you provoke this kind of enemy, no matter how powerful the power is, it will quickly decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past countless years, there have been many unbelieving Lords who paid the blood price for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex, it's not easy to ask the dragon clan to take action, not to mention the time is too late! You all know the concept of time of the dragon.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor is just worrying about it. Long-lived creatures like giant dragons are really insensitive to time. Creatures that can sleep for several years at a time, it is impossible to expect them to make efficient decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe before the dragon clan could be persuaded to intervene, the orc empire would do the ancient work first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's difficult to convince the dragon clan, but it's not that difficult to persuade a giant dragon. As long as we are willing to spend a lot of money, we can buy a giant dragon to mediate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we don't say anything about this kind of thing, how will the human race know that it is a giant dragon that mediates, not the entire dragon race?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, if the various ethnic groups in the mainland are invited to intervene and jointly put pressure on the ethnic groups, they will most likely compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In essence, those who firmly advocate the destruction of the empire are those countries in the northern part of the human race, and among these countries, the Alpha Kingdom has the most say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking them down is equivalent to taking care of half of the main fighters in the human race, and the rest of the problems can be easily solved. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has considered this plan for a long time. After weighing the pros and cons of all parties, we came up with a plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, with his steady personality, he doesn't like to act so hastily. However, the hole left by the old Bi Menghuang was too big, and he had to find a way to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please take a short vacation. I have something to do in the afternoon and I need to go out. It may not be updated on time at night!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Among all the dragons, this guy is the top three with a bad temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, if you are disturbed, you will either be entertained by a mouthful of magma, or you will be slapped to death with your tail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Swallow it in one gulp, that is the treatment of other races. Orcs, who are regarded as dirty creatures by giant dragons, are not even eligible to be devoured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical double standards, obviously the dragon race is the most stud race, but they still despise the orcs who are mixed blood from multiple races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A giant dragon in heat can be sexually aroused when it sees its mother. Anything that flies in the sky, runs on the ground, or swims in the water can all become objects of lust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countless sub-dragon species on the continent of Aslant are all thanks to the giant dragon family. Fortunately, they are not permanently stationed in the mainland, or sooner or later, the whole mainland will be full of dragon descendants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim was willing to talk nonsense because he was really angry. Just killing the group of orcs in front of him could not eliminate the anger in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coming out of Long Island, everything went wrong for him. I just arrived at the Warcraft Mountains and fell in love with a mountain, and wanted to build a lair, but I didn't expect that the \"landlord\" was not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The female bear with the same bad temper came out, and had **** with Kai Kai without saying a word. Everyone's strength is at the same level, so whoever is singled out is afraid of whom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the opponent didn't follow the rules. After suffering a loss in the battle, he called another Earth Bear to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, Maxim had a tragedy, being chased and beaten by two earth bears all the way. If it wasn't for his fast enough speed, coupled with his strong physique and resistance to beatings, he would have almost lost the dragon's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the depths of the Warcraft Mountains, he chased and killed him all the way to the edge. Seeing that he really couldn't take him down, he was finally willing to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, who has suffered a great loss, has realized that the continent of Aslant is not easy to mix, at least it is not his turn to dominate the Warcraft Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply built a lair on the edge of the Warcraft Mountains, settled down and slowly recuperated. After a year of nap, he was woken up by the group of orcs in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The double rage was superimposed, and the hot-tempered Maxim decided to let these orcs who bothered him die slowly in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong, the leader of the elder Yingman hurriedly said: \"Respected Lord Maxim, we have come here specially to give you a gift after hearing of your resounding reputation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing that it was a gift, Maxim's expression softened a little, and then he became furious: \"You reptile are lying!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time he has entered the continent of Aslante, and his first show was when he was besieged and hunted down by two earth bears. Talking about \"prestige\" is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the elder Yingman who was the leader was startled. Don't giant dragons like to listen to flattery? Why don't they play cards according to common sense!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the old man reacted quickly enough to realize that his flattering had hit the horse's hoof, and hurriedly remedied: \"What are you all doing in a daze, quickly open the box!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the glittering golden light caught Maxim's attention, and the original anger was extinguished at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greed for money is the biggest weakness of dragons, and the red dragon Maxim is no exception. His biggest wish is to have countless gold coins, and then hook up a beautiful female dragon to make a baby dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One head is not enough, a group is better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food and sex, as an adult dragon, this is completely normal for Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come out this time to get enough treasure. If he hadn't been beaten up by two earth bears, he would have gone out to make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These treasures belong to my uncle, you reptiles, stay away from me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim couldn't help reprimanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be heard from his tone that he no longer has the killing intent just now. It can only be said that the allure of gold coins is so strong that even the decision of the dragon can be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After retreating more than 50 steps in a row, and feeling safe enough, the old man Ying said slowly: \"Respected Lord Maxim, these are just greetings, which only represent the high respect of our orc empire to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continent of Aslant is raging with flames of war, and all ethnic groups are restless, and there is an urgent need to establish a new order. How could such a grand event be without your participation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are here this time to invite you to participate in the Continental Congress on behalf of the Orc Empire and to witness the peace agreement reached by various races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can rest assured that everything will follow the old routine and nothing will be difficult for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the work is done, we will reward you with gold coins equal in volume to yours. Your contribution to all races in the mainland will also be sung forever by bards! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having learned the lesson from last time, the old man Yingman's flattery was very successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he give a big price, but he also praised Maxim high, without any mention of a deal, which was very in line with the red dragon's appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to doubt the IQ of the giant dragon. As long as they are not in heat, they can be online most of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose of the Orc Empire spending a lot of money to invite him to participate in the Continental Congress, Maxim is very clear, it is nothing more than wanting to take advantage of the Dragon Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, it's okay to witness the Continental Congress. But I only represent this dragon to participate. If you represent the Dragon Clan, you have to pay more!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Maxim stretched out his paws, making gestures. Such a straightforward transaction made the old man of the Eagles stunned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are all dragons so straightforward?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragons recorded in the classics are all face-saving megalomaniacs, and they have always been self-centered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The red dragon in front of him obviously didn't follow the routine. Generally speaking, only the elderly Gu Long can practice this kind of shamelessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what you think in your heart, but the old man Yingman pretended to hesitate and said: \"Well, the price is according to what you said, my lord!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to negotiate business with Julong, you must be mentally prepared to be ripped off. Anyway, this time he came here on behalf of the Beastman Empire, no matter how much money was paid by the Empire, he didn't bother to take the risk of bargaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a lesson learned from the past. In the past, when someone was bargaining with the dragon, he was accidentally slapped to death by the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom wants to negotiate, and the Orc Empire also wants to negotiate. When both sides want to resolve the issue through diplomatic means, everything becomes easier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon a letter of mediation appeared on the desks of the leaders of various ethnic groups in the mainland. Affected by the mediation letter, the Terran Alliance urgently announced a meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All because there is a huge paw print on the mediation letter, the aristocrats with a little knowledge can recognize this as the symbol of the Dragon Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If other races dare to jump out to mediate, even if they don't slap back, they will throw the mediation letter into the trash can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, the human race has the confidence to say no to all races, except when facing the dragon race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you know that the number of giant dragons is rare now, the total number of giant dragons in the world may not exceed five figures, and the overall strength will definitely not catch up with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being strong in comprehensive strength does not necessarily mean that you will be able to win. When encountering a creature like a giant dragon, which has almost no shortcomings except for its quantity, the crowd tactics are meaningless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the two sides start a war, the dragon can sneak attack any place of the human race, and there is no way to even defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how big the family is, it can't stand the constant toss. If they are constantly attacked by the dragon, the human race will soon be pulled down from the overlord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing the seriousness of the problem, a group of representatives quickly started discussing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Dragon Clan has not intervened in mainland affairs for a long time, how could it be possible to intervene at such a juncture?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is mostly forged by the orcs, trying to use the power of the dragon clan to escape, we must not be fooled! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Derek took the lead in objecting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a representative of the Warhammer Kingdom, his hatred for the Orc Empire has penetrated to the bone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When hatred gains the upper hand, rationality inevitably takes a backseat. Even the ancient strategy of retaining the orcs to contain the Alpha Kingdom, they can't care about it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are too pitiful. If the Alpha Kingdom grows bigger, it may only occupy their interests, but the orcs will really kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a little bit short, and the Warhammer Kingdom became history, which really scared them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Switched to the Alpha Kingdom, if they want to invade the Warhammer Kingdom, it must be done within the rules of the game. Even if they won the battle on the battlefield, after the Terran Alliance intervened, they still had to retreat obediently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is a Principality of Moxi in the middle, the probability of an armed conflict between the two countries is not high, at most it is a competition for the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is very simple to judge the truth of the matter. As a mediator, you must send a representative to the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's assume that this mediation letter is true. If there is no dragon representative to participate, it will not be too late for us to take action to destroy the orc empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom can be impulsive, but the Holy See must be rational. Already on the bar with the number one military power in the mainland, the Alpha Kingdom has to find a way to hold back such unstable factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the restraint of the orcs, they would have to face the joint attack of two staunchly anti-Holy See military powers at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the Kingdom of Iberia is also persuaded by them, it is not impossible to directly destroy the Holy See and establish a new obedient Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop, having a representative doesn't mean it's true. Not all dragons are so moral, and some are just as greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as enough money is given, it is not impossible to buy a giant dragon to pretend to be a dragon representative to lead the mediation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar cases have actually happened in history. If he was deceived by the orcs and missed this opportunity for nothing, the evaluation in the history books will not be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we analyze carefully, we will know that the dispute between us and the orcs does not affect the interests of the dragon clan, and they have no reason to stand up for the orcs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Nigel objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a victim of this war, the Principality of Orton also became a staunch Beast Extermination faction. Orton XIX had issued a death order early on, pushing forward the proposal to exterminate the orcs as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost the representatives of the major forces in the north have received similar orders sooner or later. It was obvious that I felt the pain on my skin, and I didn't want to do it a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only surprising thing is: the Alpha Kingdom, the firm vanguard of destroying the \"beast\", has remained silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the orcs have \"hostages\". If the Alpha Kingdom dares to promote the proposal to eliminate \"beasts\", they will tear up their votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Charles III, who led the meeting, was still hesitating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wanted the feat of exterminating the orcs, but he was unwilling to bear the price of destroying the orcs by the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves national interests, and everyone is realistic. Except for the countries in the north, it is difficult for them to share the real benefits of destroying the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the case of the ambiguous attitude of the Alpha Kingdom, the plan of replacing the country will definitely not work, at most it will be allocated an enclave on the corpse of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Expanding the territory seems to be very wonderful, but the prerequisite is that the obtained territory is fertile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the territory where the orc empire is located is a place of bitter cold. The fact that orcs can survive does not mean that humans can also survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you get good land, it is still a piece of white land. If you want to develop it, you will have to spend a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, this vote was done. Charles III didn't have to do anything, and spent the rest of his life concentrating on developing new territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long-term investment will not see benefits, even if the enclave is developed, it will be difficult to obtain substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the difficulty of management is not directly proportional to the benefits, it is better to let the local people build their own country directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not worthwhile to destroy the orcs, but it is also not the best policy to let the orcs go. The Terran Alliance has engaged in such a big battle, if they do nothing, what will it be like?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least for the host, Charles III, the loss of prestige will be very large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom, which has the most say, has an ambiguous attitude, the Alpha Kingdom pretends to be deaf and dumb, and another major force, the Holy See, strongly opposes it. The support of the northern countries alone is obviously not enough to influence the decision-making of the Alliance Conference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the Holy See doesn't care about whether or not the Orc Empire will be wiped out. The strong opposition at this moment is mainly because they do not want the alliance meeting to make an immediate decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the Alpha Kingdom is trapped in the Orc Empire, which is exactly what they want to see. The longer the delay, the lower the probability that this army will withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what choice the Terran Alliance makes, the day when the result comes out is when the front line will see the outcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Northern Expeditionary Army has not yet reached the point of desperation. Breaking through and leaving at this time will at most suffer heavy losses, but it will certainly not be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the short term, the Alpha Kingdom will fall into decline, but once there is no orc empire to hold them back, they will rise again soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the top three military powers of the human race, the Kingdom of Frank and the Kingdom of Iberia rely on their strong strength, while the Kingdom of Alpha is an advanced \"mobilization mechanism\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countries that are similar to the Alpha Kingdom in all aspects, but when it comes to mobilization capabilities, these countries are not half as efficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficient mobilization mechanism allowed the Alpha Kingdom to rank among the top three among the Terrans despite the lack of high-end strength and elite numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these things that can be seen, what makes the Holy See fear the most is the resilience of the Alpha Kingdom. A country devastated by the orc empire, able to stand up every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many powerful countries, but they all turn into dust in the end. There are only a few words in the history books to prove that they existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one country that falls and falls again and again and stands up again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an enemy, if he doesn't take the opportunity to inflict heavy damage. Once the orc empire is gone, the rising Alpha Kingdom will be their nightmare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, high-end power can be accumulated slowly over time. If fifty years is not enough, wait a hundred years. One hundred years is not enough, two hundred years is still possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time passed day by day, and it was half a month in a flash. The Human Race Alliance did not give a reply, and the Orc Empire was also in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is not good. The Terran Alliance seems to have discovered something. Maybe we should let Maxim show up and put pressure on them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, all ethnic groups in the mainland must also speed up public relations. Regardless of the strength of each race, the more races involved now, the greater the pressure on the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those big families, we must explain the pros and cons to them. If we really fall, they will have a good life for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ambitions of the human race are unlimited. If they are not curbed, they will unify the continent sooner or later! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how many shortcomings, he is also an emperor. Having a bad temper does not mean that you have no brains. When you are rational, you are not bad at political wisdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is easy to let Maxim show up, but whether it can deter the human race is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not done well, it will backfire. The current human race should only doubt the authenticity of the dragon's intervention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is too obvious and let them discover the problem, it will really block the way of negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best thing is to let the red dragon go out by itself, it doesn't look so deliberate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Public relations of all races, everyone has been working hard. Now we have convinced the dwarves, half-orcs, and barbarians, and are working hard to lobby the elves and wood elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for these big families, the rest of the small families can only make up a few, and the right to speak is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sea Clan, if anyone has a relationship, you can also contact them. If they can encourage them to invade the human race again, it is worth paying a certain price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of deterring the human race, it is better to intimidate the Alpha Kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi first. After getting rid of them, the strength of the main combat faction in the human race was weakened by half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the Holy See solve the rest for us. In this war, they may have played a disgraceful role, and it just so happens that I have some evidence in my hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't help, poke things out in secret. And spread to the outside world that we have reached an agreement with them to lead the armies of various countries into a trap and destroy them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to keep the orc empire, he also took great pains. Even the strategy of alienating the Human Race Alliance was taken out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the relationship between the nations of the human race and the Holy See, it is hard not to be suspicious when hearing such rumors. If a little more \"evidence\" emerges, even if it is very far-fetched evidence, it will be enough to cause a storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Alex didn't want to do it unless it was absolutely necessary. Once the road has reached this point, the Holy See will be offended to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, when there is a war with the human race, it may be difficult to find such \"professional lagging\" teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is busy repairing the defense line, is naturally ignorant of the game between the major forces. Now they are still counting on the reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance to come and send troops together to rescue the main force of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, he has received private promises from many great nobles. As long as the private army of each family can be rescued, everyone will be their own in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the representative of the Dalton family said: The southeastern province has a vast territory and fertile land. It can fully support two nobles, and everyone can seek common development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one who didn't respond was the Lochnard family. There is really no way to resolve this feud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is in a hurry now. I am afraid that my main force will be damaged on the battlefield, and I will not be able to face the next big reshuffle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can fully understand their thoughts. The elites of each family are in the Northern Expeditionary Army. Once they lose it, it will mean that the family has no future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it survives the next big reshuffle, it will decline rapidly because there are no successors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a large family, compared with the loss of military strength, the loss of core talents is the most fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"dragon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dragon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Look, there are dragons in the sky!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's coming our way...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking in the direction of the sound, a red figure appeared in Hudson's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The legendary creature appeared in front of his eyes. Not only was he curious, but even Bear Stearns, who had been sleeping all day, rubbed his bear eyes and stared at the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoying the exclamation of everyone, Maxim was very satisfied. According to the experience passed down by my irresponsible Dragon Mother, only when everyone is afraid can the robbery be completed with the highest efficiency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yes, he came out this time to rob. Although he was invited by the orcs to show up to frighten the human race, it did not affect his robbery in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a red dragon, how could he be a good baby?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a genius dragon in the Red Dragon Clan, if he doesn't make a famous name on the mainland, how dare he go back and brag to the younger brothers in Dragon Island!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Reptiles, quickly hand over all the gold coins and princesses, the Dragon King spares you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Placing gold on his face, Maxim didn't feel blushing at all. Because he strayed into the Dragon Tomb when he was young, and ate a lot of the special product in the cemetery - Dragon Spirit Grass, so his body was extraordinarily large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were benefits and no harm, the Dragon Spirit Grass would have been devoured by the giant dragons long ago. After all, dragons also have vanity, and they all want to be bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the price of the skyrocketing body size, part of the inherited memory is lost, so he can only rely on Mother Long to make up for him the day after tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to say how many private goods are mixed in here, and how much Dragon Mother's emotions are brought in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the sudden emergence of a \"cub\" that is bigger than herself is also a great psychological pressure on the female dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of size alone, Maxim is already close to the level of the Dragon King. As for the combat power, it is only a line stronger than ordinary adult dragons, and the gap is not very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were a dragon king, he wouldn't be chased all over the world by two earth bears, almost losing the dragon's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brilliant appearance, can't fool monsters of the same level, but it is enough to scare humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the word \"Dragon King\", combined with Maxim's huge size, instantly caused an uproar in the army, and even Hudson was taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human beings and giant dragons have completely different paths to practice. Generally speaking, adult giant dragons are equivalent to human sanctuaries. Most human sanctuaries are not opponents of giant dragons, and occasionally there are individual strong people who can counterattack, and the specific situation cannot be generalized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary human sanctuary would definitely take a detour when seeing a large army. Surrounded by the army, there were not one or two sanctuary powerhouses who drank hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different when it's replaced by the Dragon Clan. With their super defense power, ordinary swords have no lethality at all. Only the powerful magic bed crossbow or heavy magic crystal cannon can pose a threat to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest feature of the heavy firepower is that it is bulky, its flexibility is obviously hopeless, and the probability of hitting the dragon is obviously pitifully low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the target is replaced by the Dragon King, the situation will be even more serious. Most of the magic crystal cannons can only tickle them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to kill the Dragon King, you should rely on the strong to pile up! Large-scale attacks that disperse power are useless against these perverts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good thing is that the number of dragon kings is very rare, and most of them are old dragons, who are not as lively and active as they were when they were young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cut, a parallel dragon king can brag!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' voice made Hudson recover from his shock. When the real Dragon King robbed him, he had no choice but to admit it; if it was a fake, then don't blame him for having other ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragon in front of him doesn't look very smart at first glance. Serious dragon, who would foolishly come to rob the army, especially the sentence \"Hand over the gold coins and the princess\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold coins, the nobles in the army brought a little bit, but the amount is definitely not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Princess, that's even more nonsense. Who is full and still takes the princess with him when he is fighting?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that a certain bard with an abnormal mind made up a new story to fool the \"stupid dragon\" in front of him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I didn't hear that, hurry up and ask your commander to get out and answer, or else the Dragon King will start a killing spree!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's voice sounded again, Hudson rolled his eyes directly, but he didn't rush to reply, instead he turned his attention to Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meaning is very obvious: It depends on whether your own bear can cover it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can cover it, then go out and answer it positively; if you can't cover it, then let the army besiege directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how low the hit rate is, as long as the number of attacks increases, there will always be a possibility of being hit. If you can't be a dragon slaying warrior, driving away the dragon is also a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a coach with rich combat experience, Hudson has long been used to one-on-one success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, we still have an army! If that guy doesn't show face, beat him up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the eager Bear Stearns, Hudson's courage suddenly strengthened, but he still didn't foolishly run to the dragon, but used sound transmission magic from a distance:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Dragon, I think you must have come to the wrong place. This is a military camp, and there are neither gold coins nor princesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to rob gold coins and princesses, I suggest you go to the next-door orc empire, where there are more royal families and more princesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come to think of it, you can see that there are no people in this area for hundreds of miles. It turns out that this place is very prosperous, but it's a pity that you came a step late, and the wealth has just been looted by the orc army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the big trick came out, it was Maxim's turn to be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like there is nothing wrong with it. The Orc Empire does not pay attention to monogamy, and the number of princesses is indeed a bit large. You just robbed the territory of the human race, and you should have money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But just after receiving money from others, it would be too immoral to turn around and go back to looting others. If it gets out, it will hurt Longpin very much!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Humans, stop talking nonsense. I will indeed go to the Beastman Empire, but you still have to pay for the road, otherwise...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Maxim finished speaking, Hudson interrupted bluntly: \"Mr. Dragon, please correct me that we don't plan to pass here, so there is no need to pay for the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that we have no money, let alone a princess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are you sure you want to take the risk of getting injured and fight with us, and leave with nothing in the end?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is spread, everyone will think you are a stupid dragon, and all female dragons will avoid you in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I would like to ask, I can understand robbing gold coins, but why rob the princess? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, Maxim's red face became even more rosy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I had no experience in robbery for the first time, and made many mistakes in a row, which really embarrassed the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all a good thing that Dragon Mother has done, saying that “robbing the princess” is the easiest way to become famous, and you can ask for a huge ransom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, what's even worse is that he didn't tell him which places are suitable for robbery and which places are not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the mind of Dragon Mother, these are basic common sense, all dragons should be born to understand, forget to popularize it to Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like running to grab territory with the Earth Bear before, this time Maxim jumped into the pit of robbing the army again. Fortunately, he didn't act recklessly, otherwise it would be another tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Human boy, besides the orcs, where else can we rob?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell me quickly, the Dragon King will let you go today! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With that arrogant expression, Hudson wanted to get him down and give him a blast. Just considering the powerful fighting power of the giant dragon, this tempting idea was finally extinguished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to beat up a dragon, but it's a big trouble if you get entangled by a dragon afterwards. As a last resort, Hudson doesn't want to be a dragon slayer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The northeast direction used to be my family's ancestral land. There should be some treasures. Why don't you go and have a look?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No lying, the ancestral land of the Koslow family is indeed in the northeast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the owner has changed now, and it has become the territory of the Lochnard family. It just so happened that their base camp was also in the northeast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the giant dragon is fooling around, no matter how you look at it, it is suspected of intentional revenge. But since it is destined to be an enemy, then it is not polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't directly lead troops to take the Locknard family's lair, that's because Hudson followed the rules. The Lochnard family has no right to mention murder with a borrowed knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family was cheated to death by them. All the more than 300 direct family members in the ancestral land were killed, and the blood feud between the two sides was thus continued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Ever since he received the news of Hudson's arrival in Northland, he has never been in a relaxed mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two families are feuds.

If there is a chance to make a move, he will definitely not be soft on the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the orc army can't take care of invading the Alpha Kingdom now. Otherwise, the supreme commander of the defense line in the northern border has been replaced by his own enemy, and the Lochnard family must be in tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, waiting like this is not an option. It will take some time for the reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance to arrive, so it is better to urge the Kingdom's reinforcements first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect them to be able to rescue us, as long as they appear near the orc army, they can disperse the enemy's forces and reduce the military pressure on our side! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a typical bad idea, but for the sake of his own interests, he can only do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only by leading Hudson away can the safety of his hometown be guaranteed, and the province is always worried about being cheated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Pias, the reinforcement situation in the kingdom is very complicated. Except for a few legions in the hands of Earl Hudson who have some combat effectiveness, the rest are all new legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all have your own information channels, and you probably heard about it. During the march, these new regiments caused a lot of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said to be a disgrace to the kingdom's army, and they are counting on them to come to the rescue…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell decisively vetoed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northern Expeditionary Army is already in danger. If unfortunately the entire army is annihilated, the military strength of the Alpha Kingdom will fall to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, if the last support army is paid in, will the future be difficult?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the royal family, the first thing he needs to consider is the interests of the kingdom. He didn't bother to pay attention to the grievances between the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five dukes of Northern Xinjiang are in the same spirit, logically speaking, everyone should support them at this moment. The reality is that several people closed their eyes and meditated, as if they hadn't heard anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is an interest. The Lochnard family has a blood feud with the Koslow family. Everyone can sell favors, but if they are directly involved in the conflict, they have to negotiate terms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no impenetrable wall in the world, and no one can guarantee that today's conversation will not reach Hudson's ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of making people anxious, they deliberately planted mines during military deployment, and it would be a tragedy to trap them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, similar things have been done countless times by the five major families in the past years, and they really dare not test Hudson's integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the deterrent power of the \"famous general halo\". If it is replaced with a military waste material, everyone will not have such worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Selling teammates\" is also a technical job, especially selling teammates in a reasonable way, which makes people unable to pick out the thorns, and it is a test of micro-manipulation ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of fear of Hudson, everyone would rather secretly help the Locknard family than jump out and get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the Duke of Cavadia felt the deepest. His illegitimate son with good abilities was tortured enough by Hudson when he was in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Sith won the position of sheriff and won the support of the noble children of northern Xinjiang, he had the upper hand in the military from the beginning, but in the end he had to leave in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What makes the Duke of Cavadia afraid is not only Hudson's military command ability, but also his strategic layout ability and ability to dig walls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calmly, he put Sith on the ground, and in the end he didn't even have the ability to resist and struggle, so he had to stop the loss in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even preparing a team for his son, Hudson was cheaper in the end. If he hadn't been behind the push, how could it be possible that so many young heroes had gone to the southeast province?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having suffered such a big loss, the Duke of Kavadia will naturally not swallow his anger. It was only out of fear of Hudson that he did not make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Dalton family took the lead against Hudson, he chose to support it; now that the Locknard family is going to take the lead, he also expressed support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this support is limited to secretly, and on the surface they pretend to be nonchalant, as if nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Nadson is located in the northeast of Kreidler Province, on the top of Mount Herunladen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The castle is surrounded by rolling hills, and the terrain is very dangerous. Only the three-meter walkway on the front can pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The south side of the foot of the mountain is the Obugai River. The river flows under the 100-meter cliff on the south wall of the ancient city. Standing on the city wall and looking down will make people dizzy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the headquarters of the Lochnard family, it has been passed down from the time of the Guangming Empire to the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dozens of sieges by the orc army, it has always stood tall, and it can be called the \"immortal monument\" in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to take root here so stubbornly, in addition to Fort Nadson's dangerous terrain and avoiding strategic locations, the strength of the Locknard family is also an important factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that at Fort Naderson at the moment, the atmosphere is extraordinarily dignified. Even if the city was besieged by an army of orcs, I have never seen everyone so nervous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous enemies, the enemies coming this time are directly exempted from terrain restrictions. No matter how majestic the cliff city is, it is nothing to the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Torsten, we just had a **** battle with the orcs. Now half of the family's troops are in the Northern Expeditionary Army. No one knows how much we can withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is really not a good time to make enemies. Otherwise, discuss with the clan elders, negotiate terms with the dragon outside, and spend money to buy peace. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what his mother said, Torsten fell silent. As the heir of the family, he has many issues to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the Lochnard family, it is not a problem to drive away a giant dragon, but it is another matter if it is replaced by the Dragon King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Admitting counsel seems to be a good choice, but the price that needs to be paid is the prestige of the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, they had a bad reputation in the aristocratic circle, and they were able to survive because of their strength. If the power shock is gone, life in the kingdom will be difficult in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating again and again, Torsten said slowly: \"Got it, mother. I'll go and test the dragon's appetite first. If we can agree, it will be regarded as bankruptcy and disaster avoidance.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that Maxim's appearance is born to do business without money. With its huge size of more than 70 meters, it can really scare many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, the special education given to him by Mother Long is not without reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Torsten stepped out of the room, the dragon flames that fell from the sky caused chaos in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made them not react fast enough, and Maxim is not a patient dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't seen anyone reply for a long time, so of course I have to solve the problem in my own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames sprayed out by the giant dragon hit the spot, and a fire broke out in Fort Nadson in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Maxim missed a point. The warning can not only scare people, but also attract the enemy's counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defenders who have been at war with the orcs for a long time have top-notch reaction speed. After discovering that the dragon started to attack, the officers below spontaneously organized a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic crystal cannon, magic crossbow, trebuchet... Regardless of whether they have any effect, they all greeted Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge body increases the efficiency bonus for Maxim when fighting small soldiers; it also inevitably increases the enemy's hit rate when being beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inadvertently, he was hit by the enemy's magic crystal cannon. This kind of attack could kill the dragon, but the pain made Maxim scream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn reptiles, dare to attack the great Maxim, you will all die!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, death is not enough, I will burn your souls for a thousand years...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The red dragon, who was so angry, had already forgotten the purpose of coming out this time, and launched the most violent revenge amidst cursing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle kicked off, and Torsten, who originally wanted to negotiate, completely extinguished the idea of ​​\"putting the matter to rest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Death is not enough, and their souls are burned, so what is there to talk about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, why don't you ask the clan elders to help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While reprimanding his subordinates, the powerful members of the Lochnard family have appeared on the battlefield. With such a big movement, it was hard not to attract their attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Maxim's huge size, the white-haired old man in the lead was startled, and hurriedly shouted: \"Mr. Dragon, I have something to do...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they didn't finish their words, and they were greeted by a tail, which made them dodge in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to talk about, so we can only fight. Soon they realized that something was wrong, the strength of the giant dragon in front of them was completely out of proportion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, a single blow from the Dragon King would have killed any of them, but this one just wounded them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be afraid, everyone, this giant dragon should be injured and unable to exert its full strength!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal cannon and magic crossbow attacks continue, and the ordinary attacks all stop, and the knights above silver can stay and join the battle! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rough-skinned and thick-skinned giant dragons are professional in killing minions. If the red dragon in front of him is allowed to toss, the defenders will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after reacting, the loss was still caused. Not too many people died directly under the claws of Maxim's dragon, but the fireworks all over the city made people have nowhere to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weird dragon flame cannot be extinguished by watering at all. There are not enough water magicians in the city, so they can only be buried with soil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in a large area of ​​fire, a little dust is completely useless. Many people were buried in the raging fire before they could react in the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rough leather and thick armor are simply natural weapons of war. If used well on the battlefield, the effect it can exert is enough to outperform tens of thousands of elite soldiers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this talent for setting fire, he is simply the best player in the game of burning fire...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tch, this dragon is really useless! It rushed in so stupidly, didn't know how to sneak attack Sap, it deserves to be beaten!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to replace Uncle Cost, these old guys are already dead, how can you give them a chance to besiege...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hidden in a special cloud, one person and one bear commented wantonly. Especially Bear Stearns, the appearance of hating dragons for not becoming talents is even more cute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tucao is Tucao, but Hudson has no intention of making a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also principles in the nobles' infighting. It doesn't matter to kill people with a knife secretly. If you participate in it yourself, the nature will change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for helping the Lochnard family deal with Maxim, it is even more impossible. His integrity is not high enough to even save the enemy,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go, Bear Stearns. This scene is about to end, and when the stupid dragon below wakes up, he's going to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't leave here, we will be discovered. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson stroked the bear's head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that this gravity magic is easy to use. It is obviously an earth-type magic, but it can actually make people fly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the threshold is too high. A strong person who can use gravity magic to this level doesn't need chicken ribs at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson's earth magic can't reach this level. On the contrary, it's wind magic that can give him, a new mage, the ability to fly for a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the sequelae are a bit big. When practicing flying skills, Hudson hit a tree more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he had the foresight to push Bears to the front every time. Even if there is a collision, the tree is gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it is replaced by an experienced rogue dragon, the Lochnard family will definitely cry enough this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Centipede insect, dead but not stiff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to destroy a large force within the scope of the rules will not be accomplished overnight, and Hudson is fully prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to encourage Maxim to do it again, but in the end he gave up on this tempting idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meng Xinlong lacks dragon birth experience, maybe they are easy to fool, but they definitely do not lack wisdom. Too deliberate design, it is easy to pass through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being targeted by a giant dragon, there will be no peace in the future, and it will be difficult to sleep peacefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had seen Maxim's shot, Hudson didn't want to stage it in his own barracks. The main reason is that I am afraid and dare not slaughter the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hitting the young ones may not necessarily attract the old ones. But if you kill the young ones, it will definitely attract the old ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the poor fertility of giant dragons, if a dragon dies casually, it might be a turmoil for half of the dragon clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    God knows how many generations of a long-lived race like a giant dragon live under the same roof. If a group of elders came to the door, Hudson would be overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of great achievement should be left to the dragon slaying warriors. Among the bards, it is sung every day, and its reputation has been passed down through the ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this treatment is more suitable for lonely heroes. After successfully slaying the dragon, it would be very difficult for the Dragon Clan to find the murderer in the vast sea of ​​people if they just found a place to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, people like Hudson, who have a big family and a career, and have concerns, dare not try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same concerns apply to the Lochnard family. It doesn't matter if you beat up Maxim, the Dragon Clan won't sit idle and do nothing to mix up such trivial matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing about Maxim, he was too embarrassed to go back and call his parents. The big deal is for the dragon to take revenge, a hundred years is not too late. If it is not enough, you can add another hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little bit of bad breath, Hudson's life was completely overwhelmed. The days passed by so calmly, and it was half a month in a flash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that the Locknard family was attacked by a dragon also spread. The clever noble officer has even thought of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But since he is a smart person, he will naturally not jump out and criticize his coach without evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, this army is still composed of nobles from the provinces in the central and southern parts of the kingdom, and they are not in the same way as the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but Hudson always feels that his popularity in the army is much better, and many noble officers secretly expressed their closeness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's as if he suddenly became the spiritual leader who was forced to go south to revenge the nobles in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the leader's position is too hot. One Lochnard family is enough for him. If he faces the five major families of the Upper Northland at the same time, it will really kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't have the guts to carry the banner of revenge against the nobles of the North, but he had already raised the banner of revenge against the Lochnard family through practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone leaned over, Hudson is still very relieved, which means he is not alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe these little nobles don't have much say in the kingdom, but they can still be used if they follow the flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several families were happy and some were sad. Maxim, who failed to rob again, dragged his tired dragon body back to the temporary cave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is really tired this time, and now he just wants to have a good sleep. The injury on the body is nothing, but I can't help feeling tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since his debut, he has planned three robberies, all of which ended in failure, and was hunted down twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a record made him have deep doubts about Dragon Mother's education.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The creatures outside are not as weak as what the dragon mother said, and the dragon is not that strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    closed the longan, and soon Maxim opened it again. The gold coins have not been earned, and he cannot sleep now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the treasure in the cave, Maxim, who was exhausted at first, soon regained his energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robbery has no future, and it is better to bluff and deceive under the banner of the Dragon Clan, which has more \"money\" prospects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Long life is difficult!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Maxim decided to change the Longsheng plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not going out to rob for the time being. First fool the human race into signing the armistice agreement, earn the gold coins promised by the orcs, and then consider whether to continue to rob the great cause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's sudden escape, but the orc empire suffered. Originally, he wanted to use this to put pressure on the Alpha Kingdom, but he didn't expect Kung Fu Dragon to disappear in a blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even more depressing was the red dragon who was suspected to be the Dragon King, but was beaten away by someone. The Locknard family has become famous this wave, and everyone knows that there are so many strong people in their family, even the Dragon King has to run away when he comes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The dragon has been found and returned to the temporary lair. Considering that Maxim just suffered a loss and is now angry, our people did not approach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this chaos, the next situation may change. Now we need to speed up the negotiations with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the main combat faction in the Terran Alliance is somewhat stronger than expected. Except for the Holy See, there is no top force that is firmly opposed to the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must grasp the rhythm of the next battle. It is necessary to put pressure on the enemy, but also to leave hope for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the intelligence detected from within the Alpha Kingdom, the enemy has rearranged their defenses, and the defender is still our old opponent, the Earl of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom is in a hurry, they directly order the Northern Expeditionary Army to break through, and our chips will be gone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang said with lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength shown by the human race is really terrifying. A group of old fellows whose lifespan was nearing the end of their lifespan disturbed the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the human race gets ruthless, the old group is not the only force that can be mobilized. However, there are only so many mobile elite troops that the Orc Empire can use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The   clan can still be mobilized, but the lair also needs to be guarded. If all the young and strong come out together, no one can guarantee whether the rebels will hit them hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For many races in the Orc Empire, the five royal families are not much different from humans, and they are enemies that occupy their living space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then give up other conditions, as long as the Alpha Kingdom can disrupt the Human Race Alliance's troop plan, we will let their people go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including those areas in the south that fell into their hands, we can forget about it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cub sells his father Tian doesn't feel bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land in the south is still the fat that was bitten off from the Alpha Kingdom by the leadership of the old Beamon Emperor and the participation of the previous generation of Lion King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has changed suddenly, and the orc empire, whose strength has been greatly weakened, has difficulty in defending its vast territory, and it simply doesn't care about the stolen land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving up temporarily is also a wise choice. Anyway, for this defeat, the dead old Beamon Emperor was responsible, so he is not needed to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I agree to make concessions. The current situation of the empire is really not suitable for forcing the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows who Caesar III is. He may not be unable to give up the matter of the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But even if it is a compromise with the Alpha Kingdom, Caesar III is still a hidden danger. If the empire wants to be stable, it must first get rid of this person!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, get rid of the Hudson too. The combination of Mingjun and famous generals is too great a threat to the empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang gritted his teeth and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person who knows the most about a person is always the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Caesar III ascended to the throne, the Alpha Kingdom with weak rulers and strong ministers had begun to decline, but it was soon reversed with his ascension.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the Alpha Kingdom regains its lost ground, Caesar III's reputation will surely rise to a higher level, enough to overwhelm various voices in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If such a powerful monarch is in charge of the Alpha Kingdom for decades, the Orc Empire will not be able to mix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the population growth rate of the human race is much faster than that of the five royal families. According to normal circumstances, the Alpha Kingdom must recover before them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The monarchs of the Alpha Kingdom of all dynasties have set the \"Northern Expedition to destroy the Orc Empire\" as their highest goal, and there is no reason for Caesar III to be an exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to win once, as long as the five royal families are continuously reduced, and then continue to consume, the victory will belong to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which has been twisted together, has become a substantial threat to the orc empire, which has been severely weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Hudson who was carried on board, who let him step on the royal court of the bear people and trample the majesty of the bear family under his feet?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shame can only be washed away with blood. If the conditions did not allow it, Xiong Renhuang would have taken action long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I support Emperor Xiong's proposal. After the truce, both Caesar III and the Earl of Hudson must be resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these two people are powerful masters, and it is not easy to get close to them. Considering our relationship with the Alpha Kingdom, even if we send out experts, there is no way to get close to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to assassinate them, it is best to be carried out by the human race. The last time the assassination of a high-ranking general in the Alpha Kingdom went smoothly, it was the result of cooperation between the inside and the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the same plan can only be used once. Even if July will be willing to cooperate with us, it will be difficult to implement it a second time. Unless there is a big force in the race to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex, you have had contact with the Holy See. They also have many conflicts with the Alpha Kingdom, can they use their power to complete the task? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Silver Moon Wolf Emperor asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last operation was nominally led by the Orc Empire, and it would be completed in July with cooperation, but in fact there were other forces involved behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no substantive evidence was found, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor still suspected the Holy See. Now that he wanted to repeat the old trick, he immediately thought of using the power of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My connection with the Holy See is not what you imagined, it's just that the Holy See placed spies in my home, and I happened to discover it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the vines, they caught their handle. However, it is still hard to say whether this little thing can be sold by the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter what kind of evidence, as long as it is passed from our hands, its credibility in the human race will be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Direct threats, the probability of them accepting is not high, it is best to trade with the Holy See in the name of the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the short term, there is no conflict of interest between us and the Holy See, and there are common enemies, we should be able to find topics together. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex replied rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the votes were cast, the ranking dropped a lot, Haiyue hum...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After a year of good life, new troubles came to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spies sent to the Orc Empire were caught, and they also got some evidence that the Holy See secretly provoked this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If their reputation is good enough, all they have to do is insist that it was fabricated by the orcs. It's a pity that the Holy See of Chenxi's reputation on the mainland is really not very good. Once it is exposed, it will be a shocking thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially their various delaying operations in the alliance meeting. If someone with a heart binds two things together, it will be their end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiots, they are all a group of idiots! This kind of thing can be exposed, what are you all doing...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the furious Pope, everyone lowered their heads one after another. There is no way, almost all departments in the Holy See have been exposed to scandals,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing more than the fact that Lei is bigger this time, making things more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the person who was caught by the orcs was a member of the Judgment Knights. It is best to recall Blake to ask about the specific situation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gulei, the head of the Judgment Knights, made up his sword without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no room for tenderness in political struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old enemy, the Knights of Judgment fell again this time, so he had no reason not to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Gulei, the matter is not up to that point. The new Emperor Bimon just caught our people and didn't deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hank was imprisoned, Xiandel was still in the Beamon Palace and was not implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex was originally a playboy, but he was forcibly pushed to the top by the old Beamon Emperor. We can't treat it with the thinking of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bad things can be turned into good things if handled well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Blake is recalled now, it will be more likely to arouse the suspicion of the major forces! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Sauron helped defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, someone needs to be held accountable. If Blake comes back now, he will be the first responsible person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a political ally, it is natural to help at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running outside, there is hard work without credit. When things are resolved and come back, it's another story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Sauron, you can't say that. If the handle falls into the hands of the orcs, that's a hidden danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if an agreement is reached this time, they won't leak it out, so what about the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can't always be controlled by others, can we? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gulei said dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to pass the level easily, how is it possible? Even if you can't kill the enemy, at least you have to scrape off a layer of oil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cake is that big, some people get more, and some people get less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally found an opportunity, he has already made up his mind, this trial of the Knights does not bleed, and he will not give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the two quarreled, and then it became a conflict between the two camps, and soon the other factions were dragged into the water, and the meeting hall was directly turned into a vegetable market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the escalation of the quarrel, Pius VII couldn't sit still, and immediately snapped: \"Silence!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Look at each of you, what do you look like now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is plenty of time to discuss the issue of accountability later. Now let's discuss whether the orc's proposal is in our interest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when Pius VII has been used to talking about \"interests\". This is inconsistent with the status of the Pope, but it is very effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time you encounter a problem that cannot be solved, as long as you start from the perspective of \"benefits\", it will be solved quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is easy to use, it will naturally be carried forward. Even though the outside world sprayed Pius VII with blood, his prestige within the Holy See was still very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there are two main requirements of the orcs, let the human alliance strike and assassinate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we look at it separately, what really embarrasses us is letting the Human Alliance stop fighting. If the performance is too much, it is easy to arouse suspicion from all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Judgment Knights have all gone to the front line. If they withdraw without a fight, they will lose face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Caesar III succeeded to the throne, he has not caused us less trouble. It would be great if he could get rid of this person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other people requested by the orcs, they are all important officials in the Alpha Kingdom, so they just take care of them when they have the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only trouble is that these people are very concerned about their own safety, and it is difficult to get close to them, let alone assassinate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the words came to his lips, Archbishop Sauron swallowed them back. As one of the oldest forces in the human race, the Holy See will naturally not lack dark means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that some methods are too cruel, not commensurate with the role played by the Holy See, and the price to be paid is too high, so they gradually withdraw from everyone's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, just agreeing to the conditions of the orcs is too cheap for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, whether it is letting the Human Alliance strike or assassinating Caesar III, we will need to pay a big price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they give us problems, we can also pay them back. The requirements don't need to be too high, as long as they severely injure the Alpha Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give them the information on the internal factions of the Alpha Kingdom, let them catch some of the factions and beat them hard, breaking the internal power balance of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, even if the assassination of Caesar III fails, there will still be enough mess waiting for him to clean up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he really despises the incompetence of the Orc Empire, so he couldn't help but help out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking for a while, Pius VII nodded slightly and said: \"We can let the orcs try it, and we will not lose no matter whether we succeed or fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the bishop of Montesson, let him prepare. Once we have an agreement with the orcs, move forward with the truce negotiation proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are not enough. If the alliance meeting agrees to a truce, we have to help the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sauron, mobilize our contacts to help the orcs lobby various races to intervene in mediation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came out, Pius VII felt something was wrong. It seems that the Holy See has intervened too much in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, the favoritism towards the orcs is too obvious, almost jumping out to support the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a human force, it is obvious that the buttocks are crooked when they play like this. If the thunder explodes one day, it will be smashed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, don't let Bishop Montesson act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our previous performance left a lot of flaws. In the next alliance meeting, we must be the main fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell Bishop Montesson to exaggerate the difficulty of destroying the orc empire at the alliance meeting, and then call on all countries to send 7 million troops to destroy the orc empire! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To promote a plan, it is not necessary to personally go into battle, and sometimes adopting the opposite plan can also achieve the goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seven million troops, the entire human race can naturally take it out. But wanting to put so many troops on the battlefield is just wishful thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heavy logistics are enough to drag any force to death. Even if it is shared by many forces in the alliance, the price to be paid is enough to make everyone hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with the huge territory of the orc empire, if you want to completely destroy the opponent, you really can't do it without a few million troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A slight exaggeration of the difficulty can rationalize the \"seven million\" figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't bear the loss, the plan will naturally fail. Coupled with the intervention of various ethnic groups in the mainland, negotiation has become the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Nadson, through the joint efforts of the defenders and the soldiers and civilians in the city, the work of exhuming corpses and cleaning up construction waste was finally completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the ruins left by the Great War, it can be seen that the robbery of the red dragon Maxim caused the Lochnard family to suffer huge losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific loss report has reached Thorsten. Looking at the detailed list above, he almost cried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too tragic. The long list of dead was no less than a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that there is still a record in the war, and they are completely confused. As the evil dragon who provoked the incident, he patted his **** and left, and all losses can only be paid by the Locknard family themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for his sanity, he would have wanted to organize a dragon-slaying brigade to seek justice from Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they are creatures, they naturally have weaknesses, and dragons are no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared with ordinary creatures, the weakness of giant dragons is not so obvious. Even if the weakness is grasped, it is not something ordinary people can grasp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an ancient aristocrat, the Lochnard family also has records in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After weighing the pros and cons, Torsten finally extinguished the desire for immediate revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct casualties caused by the war exceeded 3,000, and the casualties caused by the fire exceeded 5,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of thousands of private houses were destroyed, and property losses were even more numerous. Most of the city's residents became homeless overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can live in Fort Nadson are not ordinary serfs. Either it is the distant and near branch of the Lochnard family, or the family members who are close to the retainers, and the worst is the family members of the elite soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all their own people, and the family will naturally be responsible for this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just experienced the orc invasion, the Lochnard family had already suffered heavy losses, and now such a wave came, which made their financial situation that was not rich even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really can't stand the toss. If the dragon slaying is successful and the dragon clan retaliates, it will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how secretive it is, it is useless. Just after this kind of thing happened, Maxim had an accident. It is difficult for the Dragon Clan to suspect them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the strong, evidence is never a necessary factor, only doubt is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't expect to reason with giant dragons unless you have fists as hard as them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to take revenge, you have to wait until the limelight passes. In other words, when Maxim's enemies are all over the continent, he will make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This red dragon appeared in the frontier camp before robbing Fort Nadson?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torsten exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the Southeastern Front Army, Southwest Front Army, and Central Front Army arrived in the North, together with the armies of the nobles from the northern provinces, they became the new border guards of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning his head around, Torsten discovered the problem. The current head of the border guards is the sworn enemy of their family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Red Dragon failed to rob the border guards, and immediately came to rob Fort Nadson. It was hard for him not to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Viscount!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard from the border guards that the evil dragon descended from the sky and asked the guards for gold coins and princesses. It was only after Earl Hudson negotiated with the dragon that he sent him away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many versions of the specific content of the conversation. Some say they were intimidated by Hudson; others say that Hudson patiently explained to the evil dragon that there is no...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the report from his subordinates, Torsten's expression became even uglier. No matter which version it is, it cannot prove that the dragon's attack on Fort Nadson has something to do with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inquiry alone can only prove one result—the Earl of Hudson is powerful, and even the dragon can be dismissed in a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps sensing the change in his face, the young officer in charge of inquiring about the news hastily swallowed back what he hadn't finished speaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't be blamed for the lack of wink in the subordinates. In fact, the grievances between them and the Koslow family are originally the dark history of the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disgraced members of the Koslow family must be remembered by everyone, always looking for opportunities for revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the victors, the Locknard family didn't care so much. In the past years, there were thousands of nobles who were trampled under their feet. Who can remember a group of shabby settlers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many people who want revenge, but after so many years, the Lochnard family is still prosperous, but the former enemies have turned to dust one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson's sudden rise, they would have almost forgotten that there was such an enemy when they searched through the family records while investigating the details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the enemy, but after all, this is the unbearable dark history of his family. It's fine for the top family members to know about it, there's no need for the whole world to know about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know the matter, you all go back first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torsten said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mine that was planted by the ancestors suddenly exploded. Those of them who are juniors can only knock down their front teeth and swallow them in their stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are willing to ease the relationship and let the past grievances disappear with the wind, it is impossible for the Koslow family to agree!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the dragon attack may be related to Hudson, but there is no evidence in hand, even if they want to make use of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trouble, this matter is really difficult!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Torsten said to himself again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No! We must find a way to get Hudson down and let him continue to serve as the commander of the border guards. The family will be in danger!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wanted to return to his thoughts, but he didn't have a clue what to do specifically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influence of the Locknard family is indeed strong, but it cannot influence the decision-making of the kingdom. At least the position of the commander-in-chief of the border guards is not something they can decide with one word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get Hudson down, you must not only catch the other party's handle, but also find someone who can replace him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom had a better choice, such a high-ranking core position would not be the turn of Hudson, a sudden rise of the upstart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most capable generals are all in the Northern Expeditionary Army. Among the generals who stayed in the country, Hudson had the most stalwart military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly want to change, not to mention the Lochnard family, even the king can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first thing to oppose is not others, but the most important ally of the Lochnard family. The five wealthy families in the Northland are connected with each other, but they all have their own calculations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the commander-in-chief of the border guards. Only the Lochnard family is in danger;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle on the front line is becoming more and more intense. No one can tell whether the Northern Expeditionary Army can retreat completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Terran Alliance have been slow to arrive. In case the orcs solve the problem and the Northern Expeditionary Army goes south again, the border guards will be everyone's last line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't arrange for a general who can fight to be the commander in chief of the front line, everyone will feel uneasy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, everyone is looking after themselves, who cares about the Lochnard family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, if you want to get Hudson down now, you are going against most of the nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remarks: Political allies are not constant. One day an ally becomes an enemy the next. Don't make a fuss. It is common for countries to form alliances and betray each other, and it is also common for allies to stab each other. This setting is different from previous fantasy novels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In order to reduce food consumption, even the livestock in the army were slaughtered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to cut soldier rations. Once the logistics cannot be guaranteed, the morale of the army will soon drop to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is relying on air superiority, and the frequency of setting fires is getting higher and higher. It should be aware of our lack of food and want to crush us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this situation, even if we disguise the food and grass as ordinary tents, we will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I firmly believe that the final victory will belong to us, but reinforcements are still on the way, and we still have to rely on ourselves in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we must take measures, and we cannot allow the enemy's plot to succeed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Marshal Campbell's meaningful words, everyone's expressions changed drastically. There is a shortage of food in the army, and everyone knows it in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily material consumption of hundreds of thousands of Northern Expeditionary Forces is an astronomical figure. In the case of losing supplies and being besieged for more than a month, there is no problem if there is no shortage of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the consumption of supplies, noble officers recently stopped eating barbecue, but stewed it instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose is just to let the soldiers around you share a bowl of broth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, according to the old rules of special times, increase the supply of meat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the \"increasing the supply of meat\" in his mouth is definitely not the \"why not eat minced meat\" in the mouth of ignorant people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beastmen can eat people, and in a hurry, people can also eat orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared with the orcs, the integrity of human beings is still slightly higher. It's only done when there's really no other way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the army was besieged, there was a special team in the Northern Expeditionary Army, which specialized in handling the corpses of orcs killed in battle. In order to welcome the arrival of this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the crowd, Marshal Campbell smiled slightly when he saw no objection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the evil in the smile, which makes people's hair stand on end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's do it like this, meat will account for half of the next supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of food has been temporarily solved. Next, we have to find a way to organize a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no movement for such a long time, I guess the orcs have forgotten, we also have the ability to fight back! \"As an old commander who has led troops for decades, he has been silent since he was blocked by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the people present, who knew Marshal Campbell to a certain extent, they would all think that their commander was a rich man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After waiting for so long, finally ushered in the moment of counterattack, which is also the darkest moment of the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attack intensity of the orc army is getting higher and higher, and the casualties of the Northern Expeditionary Army are also increasing day by day. Especially in the last few days, soldiers from the five royal families appeared on the battlefield again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that the day when the enemy launches a general offensive is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no evidence, everyone still vaguely speculates that the communication between China and the orcs has encountered setbacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the enemy's vigilance is very high. Except for the scattered camps of those cannon fodder races, the camps of the five royal families are all heavily guarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scouting cavalry we sent often had accidents, and wanted to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Duke Pias could finish speaking, Marshal Campbell interrupted: \"Then we will fight the cannon fodder race!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time we have to change our style of play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from intelligence personnel, the Orc Empire is not peaceful now, and many vassal races have rebelled against the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is our best chance. As long as the relationship between these cannon fodder races and the five royal families is alienated, the next war will be easy to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly fight the enemy to consume, we fight to annihilate the whole army, it is not difficult to drag the five royal families and seriously injure their vitality! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is difficult to win tactically, then simply play strategically and die together. Obviously, Marshal Campbell had prepared for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs did not let the Beizheng army leave, so they simply exchanged the sacrifice of the Beizheng army for the enemy's vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be a bit uncomfortable for the nobles present; but it is the most beneficial choice for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Severe vitality and heavy losses have never been a problem. The real problem is that only my family is seriously injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell has great confidence in Caesar III. He believes that no matter how the situation changes, the situation in the kingdom will be under control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old political structure is broken, so it is good to establish a new political structure. Playing power checks and balances, Caesar III is a professional player.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the military meeting was over, all the nobles returned to their camp with heavy hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's going to be desperate, but everyone hasn't lived enough yet!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those aristocrats who brought their outstanding children here, even cursed themselves secretly: lard has deceived their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the eggs are put in one basket, and if there is a little carelessness, there will be no successors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too late to regret. At this point, all you can do is to respond passively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At midnight, in several brightly lit camps, small political groups were still arguing and discussing fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobility is never lonely. The more dangerous the time is, the more we need to hug together to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that each small circle is full of regionalism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is caused by the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traffic and communication limit the scope of everyone's communication. Most of the time, everyone is used to dealing with the nobles around them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past countless years, through marriage with each other, the nearby nobles have long become a family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we are competitors on weekdays, in the competition of the kingdom, we are natural political alliances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among many small groups, the alliance of the five northern dukes is the most special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other political groups, in addition to the big aristocrats, there are also some middle-level aristocrats with good strength who squeezed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only five of them are among the five major duke camps in the Northland, and all the other nobles in the Northland are vassals. Although the number of people is the least among all political alliances, the military strength is the strongest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who's out there?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While discussing matters in his own camp, someone dared to eavesdrop, and he simply didn't take him seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other four people were also full of anger. The topic they discussed just now was disgraceful. If it got out, it would immediately cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, calm down, I just received a special message. The content in it is too involved, I dare not make decisions without authorization, so I can only ask for advice...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at his son fiercely, Duke Kavadia's expression was gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really embarrassing. He should have thought that no one could handle the guards so easily except his own son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hero, the news you brought had better be big enough, or I will make you regret your recklessness!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, the content of this letter is too shocking, you should read it yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While replying, Hiro handed over the secret letter. At this time, he didn't dare to challenge the patience of Duke Cavadia, otherwise his **** would definitely bloom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, Duke Kavadia, who was originally angry, suddenly turned into horror.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing his gaffe, he soon managed to calm himself down, and then said to the other four dukes:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You should read it for yourself, the content on it is really inconvenient to explain!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias, who was the closest, took the letter first, glanced at it briefly, and his face changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any nonsense, he directly handed the letter to the Duke of Agiron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no surprises. After reading the contents of the letter, the faces of the several dukes were filled with shock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the content of this letter accurate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beast...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the words came to his lips, Duke Agiron swallowed them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just a word \"beast\", which has exposed many problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter what their reputation is, it is an opportunity for us, isn't it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have been working in the north all year round, and they still monopolize most of the trade with the orc empire. How could they have no connection with the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this kind of connection, with the outbreak of the war, was silently put away by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other nobles in the kingdom, their attitude towards orcs is both love and hate. Sometimes I can't wait to uproot the orc empire, and sometimes I can't wait for the orcs to be more active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is a benefit. The most important factor for the rise of the five major families is to resist the invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the existence of the orcs that the kingdom will continue to provide them with support, and the five major families have thus become the most powerful nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs were gone, the output of their fiefs alone would not be able to maintain the current huge armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps within ten years, they will fall from the strongest military nobles in the kingdom to the mortal world, and slowly become the goalkeepers of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still an optimistic estimate. Considering the countless enemies they have offended in the past years, it is still unknown whether they will be able to escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Chance!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It could also be a disaster!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs have a lot of appetite, even if they lose their vitality this time, it's not just our family that can handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Northern Expeditionary Army suffers heavy losses, life for our family will not be easy either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dominance of the kingdom is really a big piece of cake! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prospect described in the letter is bright. Unfortunately, the operability is too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to control the Alpha Kingdom, you don't just rely on strength alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king does not agree and the nobles in the south do not cooperate, can they really resort to military means?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how badly injured, the wrecked ship still has three catties of nails.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once there is internal fighting, the Alpha Kingdom will decline if you are not careful. The next time the orcs invade, they won't be able to find so many \"close\" allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pie, whether you eat or not will be discussed in the future. As long as the initiative is in our hands, then everything is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we need to consider whether the orcs really want to let us go. If this is a conspiracy against us, then we will be in big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Agiron said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you keep it for a long time, you will lose it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much food in the army, and the reinforcements from the alliance are slow to arrive. Even if special measures are taken, the Northern Expeditionary Army will not be able to last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two paths before us: either follow the Marshal's wishes, exchange lives with the orcs; or find a way to break out and leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the orcs are going to let us go, let's push the breakout plan and give it a try. If the breakout fails, fight the enemy directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there is no need for us to do anything, and we successfully broke out, which can only show that we are lucky. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias tried hard to encourage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the orc's promise is effective or not, he must try it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the enemies of other families, they are still hiding in the dark and waiting for opportunities; the enemies of the Lochnard family have already shown their cards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't bring back the army in your hands, you can't play against the newly rising military strongman——Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Castle of Ashes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The low stone houses, accompanied by the sound of clanging and knocking, are the unique style of this ancient city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The streets and alleys are full of people of all ethnic groups, and they live in peace here, as if they are like a Datong society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This unique landscape can only be seen in the Castle of Ashes, the capital of the Dwarf Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many reasons, all because this is the largest arms production and sales center on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Racial talent cannot be reversed the day after tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same raw materials, after being processed by dwarves, the quality is to be improved to a higher level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any dwarf craftsman is a master blacksmith in the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all noble equipment in the entire continent is sold from here. Most of the high-end magic equipment components are forged by dwarves, and then handed over to the alchemist for assembly and enchantment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that without the Dwarf Kingdom, the level of weapon forging in the entire continent will drop by two notches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this chaotic world, no one can ignore the will of the arms giant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the perverted dragons who don't need weapons are exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other races, if they want to do business here, they must abide by the rules of this place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to mix so well, the strength of the dwarves is naturally an important factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the large number of soldiers of the human race, and the large number of masters of the elves, the dwarves rely on sharp weapons and armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of crossbow arrows, magic crystal cannons... are at the forefront of the mainland. The long-range strike capability is the best in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the overall strength is not as good as that of the human race, it is also a leading existence in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A team from the Holy See walked into the dwarf palace without causing any disturbance at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arms trading is often accompanied by politics, and it cannot be done with money alone. In any big deal, the politics are discussed first, and then the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with going to the palace for military purchases by big forces. Although the dwarf king doesn't like this kind of political game, but for the sake of the national interest, he can only bite the bullet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the big bowl in front of him, he judged that the wine in it would not be less than two pounds, and Bishop Sauron, who was in charge of the envoy, groaned secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the highest reception etiquette of the dwarves, but this is what the dwarves themselves said. In the eyes of the outside world, this is clearly deliberately tossing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much to drink depends entirely on the mood of the dwarf king. Anyway, if you drink it, you are a friend of the dwarves, and if you refuse to drink it, it is disrespectful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, every time an elf mission arrives, the big bowl turns into a small wine glass, and the spirits turn into fruit wine, showing elegance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Sauron, welcome to the Castle of Ashes, please accept the highest respect from my dwarves!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's going on, why such a small bowl?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you know how to use a basin to treat distinguished guests?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go get my...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Dwarf King could finish his performance, Bishop Sauron hurriedly stopped him: \"Your Majesty, using a bowl is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm just a junior bishop, and I can't go beyond my status. Let's leave the basin for more distinguished guests! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, he wanted to slap himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typically speaking, you can't speak your head. Such a big bowl of spirits is also very fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the enthusiastic dwarf king didn't let him go at all, and waved his hand: \"Bishop, don't worry, besides the pots, we also have wine tanks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Pope comes someday, we will use a large wine tank to entertain, and the storage will not embarrass you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not daring to let the dwarf king continue to torment, Bishop Sauron immediately picked up the wine bowl in front of him and drank it down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you for your hospitality, Sauron...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Bishop Sauron finished speaking, the wine in the bowl was filled again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop, you are welcome. The dwarf kingdom and your Holy See have always been friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For our long-lasting friendship, you must have another bowl! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the word \"friendship\", Bishop Sauron was crying secretly. There is indeed a friendship between the two sides, but this is a matter of the last hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pushing forward the history, when the Holy See dominated the mainland, there were many frictions between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at the scene in front of you, you can tell how deep the friendship between the two parties is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bite the bullet and drank the second bowl, only to find that the dwarf maid continued to pour the wine, and Bishop Sauron fell to the ground drunk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make a fool of yourself, make a fool of yourself. If you don't get drunk, you'll get drunk. Take the initiative to pour down, and you can drink a little less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lord has fallen, and the dwarf king lost his interest in tossing. Immediately told the maids: \"Take the distinguished guests down to rest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sending Bishop Sauron away, the dwarf king glanced at the northern continent, waved his hand to call for his cronies and said, \"Tell the orc messengers that I have been of great help to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want us to intervene in the mediation, let them show more sincerity, otherwise the representatives of the human race will follow suit, and they will be in big trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representatives of the Holy See bought the dwarves and did not intervene in this war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the dwarf king now defaults to: yes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a representative from another country came over, he would still think so. It doesn't matter what the truth is, as long as it can be ripped off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the view of the dwarf king, the human race is very annoying, and the orc race is also not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I tend to support the orcs, it's just that the strength of the human race is too strong. Let the human race continue to grow, and one day the dwarves will have nowhere to hang out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they are all annoying ghosts, the work cannot be done in vain. If you want the dwarves to join the mediation, you have to come up with actual benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Which idiot came up with this strategy?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help but swear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northern Expeditionary Army gathered together to defend on the spot, like a hedgehog. If the orc wants to eat the hedgehog, he must first endure the sting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Northern Expeditionary Army can be wiped out, it will have to pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you choose to break out, the situation is different. The cavalry probably managed to escape a lot, and the infantry would have to see if the Lord of Dawn would save face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson is the orc commander. After intercepting once, he will take the initiative to let the cavalry leave and concentrate on eating the infantry of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading troops out to respond is easy to say, but the question is where to go to respond?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two sides was no less than five hundred miles, and the enemy's air force was flying all over the sky. Hudson didn't dare to bring his troops under the nose of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A team of one hundred and eighty people can keep secrets very well. A team of thousands of children can also be broken into pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But a six-figure army is dispatched, no matter how scattered it is, it will be a large area, unless all the eagle people in the sky become blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Lauren, please tell Your Majesty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expeditionary force breaks through the team and can enter within a hundred miles of the defense line, I will immediately lead the troops out to respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is any farther, it will be beyond the scope of ability. Anyone with a little bit of military common sense knows how big the movement of the army is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attacked rashly, I am afraid that the Northern Expeditionary Army did not respond, and the border guards paid for it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family background of the Kingdom is not strong, we cannot be self-willed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest that His Majesty better use diplomatic means to win reinforcements from the Terran Alliance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rhythm of pitting people to death does not pay for their lives. Knowing that it is a pit and jumping into it, his brain was flooded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, His Majesty the King is also very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Terran Alliance have not been seen for a long time, and there is very little food and grass left for the Northern Expeditionary Army. In order to survive, the front line has begun to eat orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are a master of the art of war, you should know what this means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Led by the five northern dukes, a group of nobles on the front line challenged Marshal Campbell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under pressure from the army, the marshal had to agree to the breakout plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Lauren's explanation, Hudson finally understood why the always wise Caesar III agreed to such an idiotic plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a joint-stock union country, when the domestic aristocrats have the same position, the king's idea becomes no longer important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been a long time since no reinforcements were seen. One can imagine the pressure on a besieged army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that staying put and waiting for help is the best choice, but human nature is selfish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are willing to sacrifice family interests, and even their own lives, for the sake of national strategy are only a minority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those big nobles who bet heavily can't afford to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breakout is a heavy loss, but the core members have a high probability of running away, which is better than staying and waiting to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but Hudson always has a sense of déjà vu of the Liaodong military group in the late Ming Dynasty when looking at the five northern dukes who took the lead in breaking out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability to defend the country is mediocre, full of talent to sell teammates and raise self-respect, a group of well-rounded scammers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the enemies are different. The Alpha Kingdom is backed by the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many forces in the alliance want the Alpha Kingdom to decline, but they cannot tolerate the Alpha Kingdom falling under the iron heel of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that once the expeditionary force is defeated, reinforcements from the Alliance will arrive as quickly as possible to turn the tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson felt relieved. It is enough to know that the five northern dukes dare not betray the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Lauren, I am naturally aware of your Majesty's difficulties. But the key to the problem is not whether you understand it, but whether you really can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is here, and Hudson's ability is limited. Whoever has this ability in the kingdom should be in charge. I am willing to abdicate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not the first time that something happened. If it had been a narrow-minded king, he would have been driven home long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson doesn't care. If he can throw away his troubles and go home, he will only feel secretly happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to become famous, and it is even more difficult to get out of it. The more critical the moment is, the more you have to \"hold on\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blindly accepting tasks that are beyond the scope of one's own ability can only lead to ruin and ruin the country and the people in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson suspected that Caesar III deliberately asked him for his opinion, just to make him come out as a villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dark night, the Northern Expeditionary Army launched another attack. In order to create an opportunity to break through, the Northern Expeditionary Army has launched raids day and night in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The target of the attack was changed to the orc cannon fodder race, which was different from the previous raids. In recent days, after each attack, the expeditionary army will leave a lot of letters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The black history of the five royal families and the erupting resistance movement are written in multiple orc languages. I am afraid that the orcs will not understand, all the writing is direct narrative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the preparations are almost done. It is estimated that these orc races are almost aware of the changes in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be alienated, it should be effective now. If the enemy reacts if it is delayed, the scheming will fail. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Pias said a little excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all true words, the agreement with the orcs does not affect him as a great nobleman of the kingdom. It doesn't matter if you sell your teammates, they don't have the guts to betray the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the specific breakout plan of the Northern Expeditionary Army, they still haven't disclosed a word to the orcs. The main reason is that they know each other too well, and the two sides have no sense of trust at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the generals, Marshal Campbell sighed secretly when he found that everyone's faces were full of excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guard, take the wooden sign.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Breakout needs someone to open the way, and someone needs to be responsible for breaking the back. It is not fair to forcefully assign this kind of task that is close to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These wooden signs have their respective tasks written on them, and the drawn wooden signs will perform whatever tasks are written on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything will be decided by the Lord of Dawn. For the sake of fairness, I will not participate in the lottery. In the end, I will lead the troops directly under the headquarters to complete the remaining tasks. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thinking that when everyone was arguing endlessly, the five dukes who voted according to the usual practice were instantly dumbfounded. This is not playing cards according to common sense!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the lottery method, the probability of the five of them being able to act together is infinitely close to zero. This means that their agreement with the orcs has gone bankrupt before it even started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is the fairest way, and no one can fault it. Without a suitable reason, rashly refusing is equivalent to writing on your face: I have a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, this is taking care of their five families. The lottery is about luck, and the voting is about connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given their poor popularity in the kingdom, if they are not responsible for the decision, it will definitely be vote fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you take the initiative to propose a divorce, it will be even more suspicious. Everyone is an old fox who has suddenly become noble, and everyone knows that there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After secretly looking at each other, the five of them reluctantly joined the lottery team, expecting a miracle to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No surprises, they were not assigned together. Marshal Campbell of the chicken thief not only assigned the task of opening the way and breaking the back, but also clearly gave the direction of breaking out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many different options, and the probability of a power group being assigned together is greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially for the political balance of the kingdom. I am worried that if the troops that break out of the siege all come from an interest group, it will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this arrangement, no matter which direction the team succeeds in breaking through, the team is also filled with multiple forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every aspect has been taken care of, except for the survival five-member group who wanted to sell their teammates. Acting together with other forces, it will be useless to expect the orcs to release water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waiting for the recording officer to record their respective tasks, Marshal Campbell waved his hand and said: \"Go back and prepare, we will set off after dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this operation, we have no retreat. Either break out of the enemy's blockade and lead the team back to the kingdom alive; or stay here with the prairie and sleep forever. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic breakout battle kicked off. With the help of the Holy See, the public relations operations of the Orc Empire went much smoother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various races have been reluctant to intervene in mediation. On the one hand, the orcs have poor international relations; on the other hand, they are worried about the rebound of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the overlord of the mainland, everyone has to think more. In case the human race wants to retaliate afterwards, can the allies stand up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the Holy See undoubtedly dispelled their worries. There are people in the human race who are holding back, so there is nothing to be afraid of!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the dwarves who had a big oolong, the other mainland races were basically smooth sailing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family after family of races stood up and expressed their desire to mediate, and the pressure gradually spread to the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mainland overlord is very powerful, but the mainland overlord is not arrogant to the point of superciliousness. Facing the joint pressure from all ethnic groups, even Charles III felt the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The topic of whether to accept mediation was once again pushed to a climax in the Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, Union Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the situation got out of control, more and more people in the parliament advocated the use of negotiation means to solve the problem. On the contrary, the original anti-war leader, the Holy See, is constantly clamoring for war at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The identity of the **** stirrer has been confirmed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Members, as the overlord of the continent of Aslante, we must maintain our majesty at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The various tribes have just announced their intervention in mediation, and we have chosen to cease fighting with the orcs. If this spreads, wouldn't it make them think: My human race is afraid of them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the precedent is set, there will be more and more such bad things in the years to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I propose to use thunderous means to destroy the orc empire with one blow, and let all races know how powerful our human race is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The various ethnic groups in the mainland are not worth mentioning at all. Let people release the news, whoever dares to stand up for the orcs next, we will be the first to suppress whoever...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montezon's impassioned speech.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no surprise. Those who choose to support the Holy See's main battle proposal are all northern countries. Including the Alpha Kingdom, which has been at loggerheads with them, is also on the side of the Holy See at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was worried that if I danced too much, if I angered the orcs, I would be \"torn up\". But now that the Northern Expeditionary Army has begun to break through, the cards in the hands of the orcs are gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which has always been a staunch \"beast destroyer\", naturally wants to push forward the proposal with all its strength at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See does not deal with it, as long as the Holy See is willing to fight now, then everyone can be friends for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Dragon Clan is leading this mediation. Are you sure you want to suppress them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, a noise interrupted Bishop Montesson's speech, and also raised a fatal question—the Dragon Race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many races on the continent of Aslante, the Holy See has no need to persuade them. Only the Dragon Clan, who moved out of their lair early, made them fear the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't be joking. The Dragon Clan has withdrawn from the mainland for many years, and is alone overseas. Now I am afraid that even the exact location of the Dragon Island is not known. How can we talk about suppressing it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's just a dragon, and he can represent only himself. How to qualify to represent the Dragon Clan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson strongly denied it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, he was still saying that he needed to consider the dragon clan behind the red dragon, but in a blink of an eye, the same thing turned into a different result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Montesson is right, a red dragon really doesn't mean that, even the Dragon King is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, the five-color dragon does not have a high voice in the dragon clan. From ancient times to the present, the dragon clan has no precedent for a five-color dragon as a representative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I specifically consulted the dragon knights of the kingdom. In the last hundred years or so, Dragon Island has not issued any edicts to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are just bluffing, and they don't need to take it to heart if they want to get away with it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Charles III's words fell to the ground, the morale of the main combat faction immediately boosted, but Bishop Montesson was dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Something is wrong with the script!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How did Charles III, who was supposed to be anti-war, speak for the main war faction?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the king of the first kingdom on the mainland, if he speaks like this now, the MPs who follow the Frankish kingdom will inevitably change their positions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main combat faction, which was originally at a disadvantage, suddenly gained the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson was completely dumbfounded. He is so fickle, how can he let him play?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order given by the Holy See is to let him be in the main battle and let the alliance veto the main battle proposal. Judging from the current situation, if the quarrel continues, the parties may have to discuss how to send troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the representative of the Kingdom of Alpha with a smile on the corner of his mouth, Bishop Montesson instantly understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III was anti-war, and that was only under normal circumstances. If there is an external force involved, it is still possible to change the position, for example: someone has made a condition that cannot be refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't know what the specific content of the transaction was. Anyway, Bishop Montesson knew that things were going to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning, I was calculated. The enemy had expected him to make trouble a long time ago, and deliberately let people release a signal that the Frankish Kingdom opposed the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to get overwhelmed. No matter how shameless you are, you can't take back what you just said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Once this kind of shady insider trading is exposed, he will be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not only their family who broke out from the southeast together, but also the noble coalition army of the southeastern provinces led by Earl Pierce, and the noble armies of the two southwestern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is fighting together, not to mention that every move is in the eyes of the other party, but in general everyone still pays attention to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brave knights, for glory, follow me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Agiron roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no road, then there is only one way to kill blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Agustin, who was in charge of commanding the orc army, shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he didn't abide by the agreement, it's that the script has changed. The human race is not as unique as the orcs. Even if he wants to focus on the southern nobles, the orc soldiers under him will not be able to tell the difference!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Duke Agiron's army is allowed to leave, it is equivalent to letting go of the group of human troops in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troubles of the Orc Empire are already big enough. If the Northern Expeditionary Army is allowed to retreat completely, it might really be the end of the day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cavalry attack, stop the enemy knights!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle has begun. Two current elites collided fiercely on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Agiron's warhammer was like a gust of wind sweeping fallen leaves. The three Beamon cavalry who were intercepting them were instantly kited, and then blood and screams flew up at the same time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The personal guards followed closely behind him, picked up the miniature magic crossbow and aimed around, and every time the trigger was pulled, four short arrows flew out, and then there was a burst of screams and the sound of falling horses at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not far away, Earl Pierce had thrown away his battle shield, holding the knight's big gun with both hands at the same time, like a white light shuttled among the enemies, and the silver-white gun head was instantly covered with red clothes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach takes the lead, which obviously boosts morale. Affected by this atmosphere, the originally uneasy soldiers gradually became bloodthirsty and crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either survive and fight a **** way, or become the enemy's food, and finally turn into... Moisturizing this vast prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the army broke through, Marshal Campbell ordered the camp to be burned down, and the raging fire was still burning behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that psychological warfare is still effective. Compared with the previous battles, the movement speed of the orc cannon fodder army was obviously much slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering the interception of the human army, they immediately stopped and entangled, with no intention of rushing forward at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has learned to be smart, the fruits of victory belong to the five royal families, but their lives belong to themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The threat of the human race is indeed great, but it is the five royal families who directly squeeze them. The nature of oppression cannot be changed by wearing the hat of an orc empire together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact of this kind of passive sabotage is: the casualties of the five royal armies responsible for frontal interception have increased significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only in the southeast direction, but also in several other directions. Facing the Northern Expedition Army fighting against the \"fire\", the orc royal army responsible for intercepting it was also uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war was once in a state of anxiety, and both parties involved in the war paid a heavy price. I don't know when, several tribal chiefs have gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The time is ripe, what do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why don't you talk, the alliance has sent people over to meet us. There is only one chance. If you miss it and want to get rid of their control, it will not be so simple!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The violent-tempered wildebeest tribe chief urged eagerly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the human race's instigation, but it's not so easy to divide the races. What really had a core influence on them was the rebel organization within the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get rid of the fate of being cannon fodder, the various ethnic groups who fled in a hurry were forced to go to the alliance after experiencing the initial chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to strengthen the strength of the alliance, members of the rebel organization took action one after another to recruit orcs into the group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The various races on the front line are naturally also within the scope of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The armies of the five royal families have not yet been fully engaged in battle. Once we take the lead and run away, I am afraid that we will be hit by a thunderbolt!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sheep-headed monster said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families were too powerful, even if they agreed to act together in advance, they became hesitant when things came to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not that exaggerated, and the army of the Alpha Kingdom is still behind, they dare not pursue it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these enemies are let go for us, that will be the end of the five royal families! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man with a leopard head on his head said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't want to live and die with the orc empire, it's just that the five royal families are too pitiful. I have suffered heavy losses, so I have to reduce the strength of these vassal tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to follow them, it is only a matter of time before they die on the battlefield. If you don't want to die, you can only resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't be provoked, but can be hidden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the Orc Empire is vast enough, and the five royal families have limited population, so the control over the place is not so strict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Rebel Alliance occupied a territory that was easy to defend and difficult to attack in the rear, and directly played the separatist regime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is nothing to hesitate, if you are willing to leave together, then take your clansmen and go with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking forward and backward, I dare not leave, and I am going to continue to work for the five royal families, and we will not stop it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't become a traitor and report to the five royal families, everyone will still be your own. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The snake woman said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone is not blessed with this charming smile. The few people who were still hesitant suddenly lost their souls in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing the secret, not joining is a potential risk. When it comes to the family's wealth and life, no one will be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Done!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A rough and wild voice sounded, and immediately responders gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Haha, everyone is willing to join the alliance, so it's our own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an alliance contract, which can be regarded as a free sponsorship by my old Leopard! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leopard head said loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he had already taken out a knife and tapped his finger, and a drop of blood landed on the contract accurately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood contract!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knowledgeable elder of the fox tribe blurted out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with ordinary contracts, this blood-mediated contract is significantly more binding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you break the contract, not only will you be unlucky, but even your blood descendants will be ruined, and the contract of descendants will be cut off properly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Fox is very knowledgeable, it is true that this is a blood contract. In order for everyone to work together in the future, some necessary means are still needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But everyone can rest assured that there are no other clauses in this contract, it only clarifies that we will join forces to get rid of the rule of the five royal families. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leopard head said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all for the good of the league, and he has a clear conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he handed the contract to everyone for inspection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no trick in the first place, so naturally the problem could not be found out, and soon all the orcs dropped their blood and agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    West Front, Marshal Campbell in armor, holding a shield in his left hand and a knight's lance in his right, took the lead in front of the battle, staring at the enemy team ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of setting fire to the camp, they encountered an army of orcs blocking the road, and it took a while at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Warriors, the time has come to make contributions. Rush out from here and kill all enemies who stand in our way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the kingdom, for the human race, for the glory, come with me...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He shouted to charge, but the first thing he launched was not a charge, but a rain of arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this was agreed in advance, and boosting morale is the signal to launch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The method was a bit insignificant, but this unexpected round of arrow rain sneak attack still brought a lot of trouble to the orc army rushing towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc commander, who was stimulated, roared angrily: \"Kill, kill all these despicable human races!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the two armies collided head-on. There are no fancy movements, just the sound of clashing steel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell ignored the enemy's clamor, and only responded to them with the knight's gun in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sweeping, stabbing, and flailing... are all the basic skills of knight training, but in his hands, the knight spear seems to be alive, and every movement will take the life of an orc soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he was born for art, and the cruel battle has become full of artistry in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is his true face, the stable old marshal, just a disguise in his daily life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Excellent performance, Marshal Campbell quickly became the most dazzling cub on this battlefield, and also brought him the most hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The human race is truly blessed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the distance, Alex, who was watching the battle, couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the outbreak of the Great War to the present, he has seen too many elites of the human race. Although most of them died on the battlefield, it doesn't mean that these people are not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victory of barbarism over civilization can only prove that barbarism is tough, but it does not mean that civilization is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of personal combat power, the human race is not ranked at all on the mainland, but the final overlord of the mainland has become a human race. This is the charm of civilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is the most primitive family training system, the human race is still at the forefront of all races in the mainland in terms of talent cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wants to follow suit, but Alex has no idea how to do it. There is no way, the population base of the Beamon family is too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war, it was less than 300,000, and now it is less than 200,000.

She made up her mind to keep him, mainly because she recognized his identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal, no matter which country he is in, cannot be obtained easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in a country like the Alpha Kingdom that fights with orcs every now and then, the marshal's gold content is even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have enough prestige to command the three armies, you don't even want to get the title of marshal. This is almost the consensus of all countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is more strategic to keep this veteran than to wipe out an enemy army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a sound of \"whoosh\", and Marshal Campbell hurriedly dodged sideways, and the arrow passed by from the right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only a little bit short, and his keen perception saved his life again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Campbell had a bad idea, and his intuition told him that he was being targeted by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to shift the battlefield, a rain of arrows fell from the sky, followed by screams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attack regardless of friend or foe!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, the big gun in the hands of Marshal Campbell danced even more vigorously, and the demon wolf who sat down quickly left the area covered by the rain of arrows with a tacit understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Campbell, do you still know me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Beamon blocking his way, Marshal Campbell only felt a little familiar, but he just couldn't remember it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that you have forgotten your old friend!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it doesn't matter, I will help you recall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, it was you who cut off my military journey and set foot on Qingyun Road ever since! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the big man Beamon made Marshal Campbell's face change, and he couldn't help exclaiming: \"Impossible, aren't you already dead? Why are you still alive now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It turns out that I am already dead in your mind, no wonder you can forget it...

Soldiers may not be able to bring them out, but there is a high probability that the children of the family can save a life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rao has seen strong winds and waves, but he still can't help worrying when things come to an end. Compared with the ministers, Caesar III was much calmer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this calmness is pretended, but as long as it can be pretended for a lifetime, then it is no different from the real one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Terran Alliance meeting officially made a decision to expand the war. The second batch of expeditionary forces has been finalized, and all parties will send a total of one million troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the delay last time, this time the major forces promised to organize and mobilize immediately from the day the alliance resolution was made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troops will be dispatched within half a month at the latest, and it is expected that reinforcements from all walks of life will arrive in our country one after another in the next three months to one year! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis' words shocked people, and then returned to anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare for the Terran Alliance to be highly efficient, which is indeed good news. Unfortunately, this good news is not what everyone wants most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's normal to think about it. If the news of the Northern Expeditionary Army's breakout hadn't been confirmed, the efficiency of the alliance might not be so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the breakout situation is, the Alpha Kingdom will inevitably suffer serious damage. The three most powerful countries in the north have all been weakened, and if it continues to drag on, there may be big troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, you can fail, but you must not show signs of decadence. Even if it's just a hint of decline, that's not okay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom was seriously injured, and the next thing to do was to let the reinforcements who arrived in the early stage go to the top first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the first batch of reinforcements is 300,000, but because some human forces are too far away, there are still many reinforcements on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total number of reinforcements that actually arrived was only 250,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the orcs break the cans and fall, no matter how hard they attack, this little force is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the remnants of the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi, it would be difficult to stop the orcs' advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the defense line is broken by the enemy, the small northern countries behind will have no hope at all. The foundation of the human race in the northern continent will be severely damaged by this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could the overlord of the mainland not be hated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this kind of tragedy happens, the script of the human race that all races in the mainland join forces to invade can be picked up again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thanks for your hard work, Earl Francis. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has done a good job this time. With this good news, even if the frontline battle situation is not satisfactory, it can stabilize people's hearts.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Caesar III deliberately glanced at the officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king can punt in his belly, but the king also has a bottom line. Being forced into the palace by a group of great nobles in the kingdom, no matter how pregnant she is, she will remember it in her heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially a hero like Caesar III attaches great importance to his own authority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that he had conquered all parties and firmly controlled the kingdom, but the reality gave him a slap in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When all the great nobles are in the same position, he, the king, is nothing. No matter how powerful the political skills are, they can't hold back the collusion of the ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, Caesar III chose to be kind, but deep down in his heart, there was a strong sense of crisis that couldn't go away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers have already tried the sweetness of joining forces, who can guarantee that there will be no next time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though they didn't know what Caesar III was thinking, everyone still chose to keep their heads down with a wink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Teaming up to lift the king, theoretically speaking, there is no problem at all, but in actual operation, we will see who can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also many contradictions within the noble group, especially when encountering Caesar III, a king who is good at digging pits and mines, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom are divided into multiple interest groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, it is impossible for the Koslow family represented by Hudson to reconcile with the Lochnard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Families with feuds like this are rare in the kingdom's aristocratic circles, but there are not a few families who turned their faces because of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the relationship between everyone cannot be eased if you want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Face is a problem, trust is a bigger problem, and interest is an unsolvable problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice from outside the hall door broke the tense atmosphere in the hall and mobilized everyone's emotions again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"finally come!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone secretly breathed a sigh of relief, regardless of the final result, it is better than suffering all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The front line urgently reports that after a day and night of melee, the Northern Expeditionary Army has broken through the enemy's first blockade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the loss was a bit heavy, and many troops were dispersed, and the number of people cannot be counted at present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the loss of high-level officers was particularly serious, many senior generals of the kingdom including Marshal Campbell were killed...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish speaking, the orderly had passed out, and only then did everyone discover that there was an arrow sticking out of the man's back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tayron, hurry up and save someone!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting the archbishop of the kingdom take action to rescue a soldier who delivered the information, this is also considered a broken record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this critical moment, Caesar III couldn't care less about the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not so easy to pass the information back under the blockade of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the griffin cavalry were dispatched, it would be a narrow escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going forward to check, released a holy light spell, Archbishop Tai Lun shook his head slightly and said: \"His body is very weak now, and he is not suitable for forcible treatment, otherwise the loss of lifespan will be very serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have stabilized his injury, let's take him down to rest first! It is estimated that it will take several hours before he wakes up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this result is not what everyone wants. They want to know more about the front line than the life and death of a Gryphon Rider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Tai Lun seemed completely unaware of everyone's eager gazes. Or in other words, feeling it and pretending not to know it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't care what happens to others, but for himself, Tai Lun still keeps his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was this original intention that made him the archbishop of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he was the same as the great nobles in the country, Caesar III would not dare to push him to the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Take him down to rest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said in low spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all he can think about is the death of Marshal Campbell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal feelings aside, as the head of the kingdom's military, Marshal Campbell is an important pillar for him to control the kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although as a king, he would not pin his hopes on one person, but the spare tire was far worse than Marshal Campbell in terms of ability and prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peaceful times, the requirements for military command capabilities are not high, and this is not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it is now a time of war, and Caesar III dare not appoint a commander who lacks ability and prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the efforts of the nobles of the kingdom to fight for the fruits of victory, Caesar III also left a spare part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, among the seven provinces that were taken back this time, three of them were once directly subordinate to the royal family. This cake is enough for the royal family, there is no need to compete with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, as long as this loot is digested, the power of the royal family will be doubled directly, and his control over the kingdom will be further improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the plan did not catch up with the changes. The death of Marshal Campbell greatly reduced the influence of the royal family in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the ensuing battle, they had to rely more on the great nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, military talents who can command millions of troops are not something you can have if you want it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king is struggling, and Hudson, who is far on the front line, is also having a headache. Don't look at his straightforward refusal, but when it comes to specific actions, he is still preparing to meet the kingdom's army that broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to run hundreds of miles away to meet them, but within a range of one hundred and eighty miles, he still has to reach out to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is the military power of the kingdom, and every point that can be saved is worth one point. At this juncture, picking up one more soldier will reduce the pressure on the military in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, you said that a major change occurred within the orc army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scouts sent out never returned, including two nobles with flying monsters. As a last resort, I can only ask Bear Stearns to take a trip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northern Expeditionary Army suffered heavy losses, and the news of Marshal Campbell's death did not surprise him, but the internal changes in the orc army caught Hudson's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that this might be an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you mean by that, am I that kind of unreliable bear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said with an unhappy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first Hudson wanted to nod and say yes, but seeing the serious expression on the cub's face, he finally held back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell me specifically, what happened in the orc army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson changed the subject.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him, don't try to argue with the brat, or he could pester you endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not a big deal, it's just that a group of orc tribes quit and left the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that there is one-third of the total strength of the orc army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the five royal families, there are all kinds of messy races, and it is estimated that they have fallen out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Bear Stearns' answer, Hudson was taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One-third of the troops were reduced at one time. Even if all the troops were sent by the cannon fodder army, it would greatly weaken the strength of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the elite troops are not affected, the question is, are the five royal families willing to use their own direct descendants to fight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs didn't send troops to intercept them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he already expected the orcs to fight. No matter who wins or loses, as long as this kind of civil war is ignited, it will deal a heavy blow to the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't know what the situation is now.

But this kind of thing is also a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No ruler can tolerate betrayal. If he has not taken military action now, it means he has not reacted, and it does not mean that he will not take action in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the style of the five royal families, if these rebels are not washed away, the future orc empire will be full of rebellious flags.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Came back to his senses, Hudson's eyes focused on the death of Marshal Campbell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The supreme commander of the kingdom's army died, and all the noble coalition forces were still running for their lives in a hurry. In a flash, he became the kingdom's supreme military commander passively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't even know what words to use to describe this dramatic scene. It is estimated that the big bosses in the capital are also having a headache at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the army stop training and rest for two days.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking through the siege of the orcs is just the beginning. There is still a more cruel way to escape. Whether you can escape or not depends on your luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the distance between the two sides was more than 500 miles. Considering that it is impossible to only go in one direction when fleeing, the actual distance may be farther.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the juncture of life and death, and people have the most potential to explode, Hudson decided to lead troops out to respond after two days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, he added to the chief guard: \"Tom, make a copy of the news we received and send it to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell His Majesty the King that we have taken action and are responding to the officers and soldiers of the Northern Expeditionary Army who broke out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a minister, one must know some rules. Making one more report may not have any effect; but if one report is missing, it may become a trick in the hands of political opponents at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp of the orc army severely damaged the five emperors of the Northern Expeditionary Army, and there was no joy on their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being betrayed by his subordinates undoubtedly exposed the internal contradictions of the orc empire to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given the opportunity to attack the former overlord of the mainland, how could the human race not take action?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation has changed. Campbell, that ghost, seems to have noticed something. When he ordered the breakout, he deliberately mixed the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all the forces in the Alpha Kingdom have suffered losses to varying degrees, and the advantages of the northern nobles are not obvious. Next, we need to increase our efforts to strangle the southern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not enough. To make the Alpha Kingdom into chaos, it mainly depends on whether Caesar III can be killed. If this guy was alive, the group of soft-legged shrimps wouldn't be able to make a fuss at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex deliberately avoided the important point and said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of traitors is not easy to solve. It is better to pick the problem that can be solved and solve it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To defeat a large force, external pressure alone is not enough, and internal assistance is also needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce their own pressure, it has become the national policy of the Orc Empire to set off civil strife in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See has already started planning the assassination of Caesar III, and has been waiting for the opportunity to implement it. Even if we don't ask, they will do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most troublesome thing now is the Terran Alliance. People from the Holy See sent news that the situation has changed. The strength of the main fighters in the Human Race Alliance has surged, and they can't control the situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation cannot be controlled, in other words: the war will continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Orc Empire, which is misty in the wind and rain, it is the greatest disaster for the war to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not mention the exposure of the handle in hand. Because once the hole card is played, it becomes a bright card.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See will certainly become more notorious, but their reputation has never been better. If you are in a hurry, people can still forcibly clean up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: to spend money to destroy the orc empire, to prove that they colluded with the orcs with actual actions, it was completely framed by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to look at the result, who cares about the truth in the middle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We don't have much time left, we must deal with the Northern Expeditionary Army that broke out as soon as possible, and then go back to clean up the domestic rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the rear is not stabilized, once the human army comes over, it will be our end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the dragon's mediation plan was seen through by the enemy. Otherwise, the Terran Alliance would never dare to be so arrogant! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King almost roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was finally his turn to be the boss. Unfortunately, the good times are not over, and the human army is about to kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had known that the various ethnic groups in the mainland were so cowardly, he would not have blindly provoked this war, so as to bring the ethnic group into a dangerous situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is not the opponent of the various races in the mainland + the dragon clan. Unfortunately, the various races in the mainland may have the motivation to join forces, but the dragon clan definitely does not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The position of the overlord of the continent has great benefits for all races on the continent, with the exception of the dragon race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competition for living space?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the pitiful number of dragons, Dragon Island is vast and sparse. Even if every dragon occupies the mountain as king, 99% of the land remains unowned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competition for resources?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are very few treasures that can be favored by giant dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for gold coins, that's just a daily hobby. If you want to go out and grab it yourself, there is no need to start a meaningless war for such a little thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dragon Clan does not participate, and the combined strength of the various races in the mainland is still higher than that of the Human Clan. However, this advantage is no longer so obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the lack of trust and being separated by the human race, it is difficult for everyone to unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire is a negative teaching material. As the leader who wants to form an alliance, he will now suffer the cruelest social beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps all ethnic groups in the mainland want to give them a hand now. But when the human race took a tough stand, everyone's confidence was obviously lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the sequelae of bad interpersonal relationships. No race is willing to take the lead in confronting the human race in order to save the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is calling for peace. The so-called pressure is at most like the dwarves and elves announced: During the war, it is forbidden to sell weapons to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or go a step further, learn from the half-orcs and barbarians, and directly suspend trade with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the self-sufficient feudal lord economy, such a small pressure obviously cannot scare the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If \"prohibition of trade\" is replaced with \"threat of war\", the current situation is another style of painting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Northern Expeditionary Army has been dispersed, and it can no longer pose a threat to us. In order to improve efficiency, let's split up next!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave the cavalry to continue chasing and killing the remnants of the enemy, and the infantry will go back first to solve the domestic rebellion. If it drags on for a long time, maybe those traitors will attack our people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagle Emperor said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They belong to the five royal families of orcs, so there are differences in strength and weakness. The Eagle Clan was able to obtain the status of the royal family mainly because they killed all their competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the only air force that can be formed in the Orc Empire, it naturally has a unique status. This is the opportunity to form an alliance with the other four clans and create a political structure in which the five royal clans rule together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the rebels attack the people in the country, the other four royal families, old and weak, women and children, will also have good fighting power, but they will not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eagle man who can't fly is in the middle and lower reaches of the orc race. It's not surprising that they can't handle the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then divide the troops! But when chasing, be careful and don't get too close to the enemy's line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current defender of the Alpha Kingdom is the Earl of Hudson. Everyone must have a good idea of ​​how this man is capable of using troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on hundreds of thousands of defenders, they have been holding back in the fortress for more than a month, but there is no movement, and they are probably plotting some kind of conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If coupled with the cooperation of rout soldiers, I am afraid that ordinary elite cavalry regiments may be eaten by him if they are not careful. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor warned everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he likes to meddle in other people's business, it's that the current five royal families need to help each other. If the infighting continues, sooner or later everyone will die together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way to escape, the Duke of Cavadia has long since lost the image of a high-ranking Duke in the past, replaced by a haggard face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are not the focus of the orc army to hunt down, but it does not mean that the orcs will stop chasing and killing them. The thoughts of the emperor above do not represent the thoughts of the orc soldiers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all human troops, so kill them when you see them. As for which nobles these troops belonged to, the orc soldiers at the bottom didn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having escaped the enemy's three sniper attacks in a row, the physically and mentally exhausted Duke of Cavadia just wanted to sleep. It's a pity that this is just an extravagant wish after all. Now that I'm sleeping at this time, I guess I will sleep forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where is it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking a look at the sky, Duke Kavadia asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the province of Okoro, which already belongs to the territory of the kingdom. It's just that the area was completely destroyed by the orcs, and our defense line has not been extended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, the nearest city controlled by the Kingdom is less than three hundred miles away from us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimated that the supporting army has already started to move at this moment. As early as tomorrow, we can hope to meet the reinforcements who will respond. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to perform in front of his own father, he would never miss it. Even though he knew that doing so would easily offend people, Sith couldn't care less about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an illegitimate child, he has to fight for everything by himself. Especially when the southeast province couldn't survive, he needed to prove his ability even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only gratifying thing is that the old rival Hudson is running very fast. It has only been a year and a half since they separated, and their reputation has spread far and wide. There is no shame in losing to such a competitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under Sith's hard work, the Duke of Kavadia, who was about to give up on him, gradually changed his view.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is the crystallization of his own love. As long as Sith is capable, he still hopes that this son can do better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suffered a big loss, it doesn't matter. As long as you can learn from it, you can also stand up again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith is also very competitive. These days with him, he has performed exceptionally well, even faintly overpowering his son-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the limitation of identity cannot be made up by hard work. Even though the Duke of Cavadia values ​​this son very much, the rules of the game still have to be followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't have too much expectation for the reinforcements to respond, have you seen any griffins flying from the sky, our whereabouts have been discovered by the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson stationed there is a southern nobleman. Even if it is a rescue, he will go to save his own people first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hiro on the side said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't have any affection for this extra cheap brother. The two sides had already fallen out, even in front of the Duke of Cavadia, there was no less trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words just now seemed to be accusing Hudson, but in fact they were alluding to Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the kingdom is in danger, there is no need to divide the camps to respond to the soldiers who broke out. But there is one exception, and that is the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you consider the overall situation, you can't expect others to respond to your enemies. If you don't stab a knife in the back, it's all moral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's enough, Hero. I don't want to hear such words that undermine unity when the kingdom is in crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson is the pillar of the kingdom, how can he disregard the interests of the kingdom because of some trivial matter! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Cavadia couldn't help but warn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palms and backs of the hands were full of flesh, and the son fought, and the worst thing was him, the father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether Hudson will send reinforcements to respond, Duke Cavadia has no idea. But on the surface, it must be said: there are reinforcements!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fleeing all the way until now, there are only seven or eight thousand people left behind them, and the morale of the army has fallen to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, if you don't release a few good news to boost the morale of the army, how will you go about the next escape route?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that he had slipped his words, Hiero blushed slightly. But looking at Sith's eyes, he became more and more unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaintly, he had the idea of ​​killing someone with a knife in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Except for the kingdom's standing army, the horses and weapons carried with them are the private property of the noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, if the commander issues such an order, mutiny must occur.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, after Hudson issued the military order, it also triggered a backlash. But this small trouble, still can't trouble him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't borrow or not, you are directly recruited into the cavalry regiment to participate in this rescue mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either lend out the horse, or go with the horse to perform the task. No matter how great the grievance is in their hearts, everyone can only hold their noses and admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refusal to go on a rescue mission, that doesn't exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles of the kingdom are almost all in the breakout team. If you are against the rescue, then you don't have to hang out in the circle of nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if we go out with such a big fanfare, we are afraid that we will alarm the enemy?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the one who took the blame for the Battle of Dacias, he, the court earl, attracted the firepower of the families of the nobles who died in battle as soon as he returned home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under external pressure, Caesar III had no choice but to imprison him, and his title was also taken down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is well aware of the scapegoat for the crown prince. Physical suffering, naturally did not eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, it was a questioning, but in fact it was protected by the royal family and entertained with delicious food and drink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Caesar III went to visit him personally and comforted him personally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of buying people's hearts, the king is still qualified. Even if he was blamed, Jose didn't complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the material life is, it can't help but feel tired. No matter how good the rice borer's life is, it is not what he wants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles need dignity. Who can bear to spend the rest of their lives with a bad reputation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Caesar III is an interesting boss, and under pressure gave Jose another chance to cleanse himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared to the former deputy commander of the expeditionary force, he is now Hudson's adjutant, and his status is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's right to startle them, how many of our people can run out without attracting their attention?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending troops to rescue does not mean that we have to rescue them one by one. Attracting the enemy's forces and creating withdrawal conditions for the Northern Expeditionary Army can also achieve their goals! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson explained with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a reason for being able to treat a \"white board\" subordinate so kindly. The Alpha Kingdom does not lack talents, what it lacks is talents that can be recruited by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the great nobles in the kingdom have mostly good personal abilities, and they can be excellent talents after a few years of experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these talents have nothing to do with Hudson. What he can recruit now is at most the second sons of some minor nobles, and they are still declining minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, a lot of positions have been vacated after a big battle. All major forces within the kingdom are secretly recruiting talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the capital in Hudson's hands, the \"chips\" that can be offered are far inferior to the attraction of established forces to talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky Jose is the target that Hudson most wants to poach. It's a pity that Caesar III didn't give him a chance to implement it, and Jose has not yet separated from the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this series of actions was deliberately done by Caesar III for his subordinates to see, but this is what everyone will do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't talk about hypocrisy or hypocrisy, everyone only cares about how the king does it. Even if it is acting, as long as it can continue to do it, it is true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the resources possessed by the royal family, what Hudson can produce is not worth mentioning at all. Regarding the solicitation, he never mentioned it from the beginning to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not suitable for poaching, but it does not mean that there will be no opportunities in the future. If Jose is not the top military talent, he is also a top-notch strategist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-level talents are rare, and once you encounter them, there is no reason to give up easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't dig the corner of Caesar III, can't you dig the corner of Caesar IV?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince's opinion on Jose is not the slightest bit. Once he takes the throne, there may be no place for Jose in the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the sequelae of doing so, Hudson didn't care at all. As early as in the Principality of Moxi, he offended the crown prince, and he didn't care about adding a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, few of the great nobles have a good relationship with the king. Either friction here or conflict there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the kingdom has its own conflict handling system, and everyone is fighting within the rules of the game. Sometimes the king is strong, sometimes the nobles are strong, like a seesaw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in northern Xinjiang are the best example. Back then, the royal family suffered \"five labors and seven injuries\", and they are still at ease until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't met Caesar III, they would have been even more arrogant. The nobles are originally a group of masters who can shine brightly given a little sunshine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the frontier guards moved, they immediately attracted the attention of the Eagle Scouts, and they were soon fed back to the head of the Orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the current situation is a bit special. The armies of the five royal families do not have a unified commander, but each command the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it was the armies of the four royal families, and the cavalry of the Bearman clan was almost negligible, so they directly surrendered the rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the four tribes who stayed behind also had a great advantage. The only problem is that their forces are now scattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that he miscalculated the strength in Hudson's hands. He originally thought that he could dispatch more than 10,000 cavalry at most, but he did not expect that he could gather all the guards and war horses of the noble officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do scouts do? Why did the enemy suddenly have 20,000 more cavalry?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enemies are extremely jealous when they meet each other. Originally, they thought that the opportunity for revenge would come, but they didn't expect that the plan could not keep up with the changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a record of one against ten, it is commonplace for the Mongolian cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the prerequisite depends on who the opponent is. Last time, more than 8,000 Bimon cavalry were beaten by Hudson with more than 30,000 ethnic cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only relying on the 3,000 Bimon cavalry in his hands, he ran to fight against 30,000 ethnic cavalry, which would be a sure gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the existence of the Knights, it was directly ignored by Prince Butzweig. There is no way, who can guarantee that there will be no this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only from the surface, the noble guards recruited by Hudson are also practitioners, and even the armor is beautiful enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, it is meaningless to pursue these things now, let's avoid the edge for now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slow down the pursuit speed, and throw this hard bone to the Lion Clan or the Silver Moon Wolf Clan to chew on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When both sides are hurting, we will come out to clean up the mess! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This moment, that moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a step late to go back, the position of Beast Emperor was settled, and Prince Butzweig's life is not easy now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competitors came to power and did not initiate purges of losers like them. That was because Alex was taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is something else to do, it is to hand the knife into the enemy's hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the struggle for imperial power, there is no room for tenderness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Prince Butzweig's current situation, he knew that not only did the heavily-lost legion not be replenished in time, but he also took on the drudgery of chasing and killing the remnants of the Northern Expeditionary Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how many enemies are killed, it should be done. Once a setback is encountered, it is a ready-made crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't it good to do this! The enemy is extremely cunning, and now everyone is dividing up their troops to pursue the Beizheng army, and there are not many mobile troops on hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, invite them to join forces and combine one place to give the enemy a hard time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said in a slightly embarrassed way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a soldier, he still has a bottom line. Knowing that it is a hard bone, he deliberately let his teammates chew on it, which is inconsistent with his principles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, at a time like this, we'd better not say anything, just pretend we don't know anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes no fault is merit!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too much involvement, in case something happens later, we will bear the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially with your current status, it is not suitable to be too pretentious. Without the order of the imperial court, he would not be happy to organize the joint operation of the armies of the four clans without authorization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are worried, then we deliberately let the ethnic army go off the beaten track, and stagger the direction with the enemy's supporting army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark eagerly persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The growth of the team is just around the corner, but Hudson has a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making preparations, he waited for the enemy to come and attack, and it turned out that he waited... It doesn't matter if he didn't mention it, so many crossbow arrows he had prepared were in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ask for these equipments, Hudson tried his best to report to the capital every now and then, stating the pros and cons of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum it up, it is possible to compile a book \"On the Significance of Miniature Magic Crossbows in Cavalry Combat\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrated the power of the kingdom and brought in thousands of miniature magic crossbows. I wanted to teach the enemy a lesson, but unfortunately the other party didn't give it a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalry who had suffered a loss once did not dare to go up, and the commanders of the lion tribe and the silver moon wolf tribe were not fools either. Knowing that the enemy is difficult to deal with, naturally he will not run to play a decisive battle when he has insufficient troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that in the past two days, it was the Yingren Air Force who came to add chaos to the army. The other three royal families are busy chasing and killing the Northern Expeditionary Army, as well as gathering the scattered teams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson took the initiative to come to the door, he could avoid it just right. If you want to play a sneak attack, first get rid of the Eagle Air Force hanging above your head!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without air supremacy, it is difficult to do anything. In this wave, he understood why the Northern Expeditionary Army was so passive because they had most of the main force in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sincerity is not a matter of working hard or not. Every move of the army is under the nose of the enemy. They want to do something, but they are discovered before they have time to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When all strategies and tactics fail to work, the two sides are competing for hard power. Under such circumstances, Marshal Campbell is quite powerful in dividing the orc army and creating opportunities for the army to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the old marshal died suddenly, otherwise Hudson would definitely visit and communicate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson also noticed a trace of conspiracy. Under normal circumstances, the commander of the army is surrounded by expert guards, and the probability of being able to break out is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you expose your identity on the battlefield, it only takes a while to break out of the encirclement by force, and leave immediately after killing the blood, and will not stay in place at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of meeting an orc master and being blocked is almost zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sold by your own people?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the idea was born, Hudson couldn't get it out. The integrity of the nobles is very polarized, sometimes it is quite high, and sometimes it is frighteningly low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is entirely possible to betray the whereabouts of Marshal Campbell in order to weaken the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides them, there are also some mysterious organizations that have also become black hands. For example: the July meeting that Hudson contacted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last major assassination case, the officially announced murderers were the orcs and the July Society. It's not purely throwing the pot away, both of them did participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can collude once, you can collude a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The July Society itself is a northern aristocrat who failed in the struggle, no matter how they fall, they still have some connections. It is not surprising to be able to obtain a position in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the captain of Kettler's Legion is asking to see you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the guard said made Hudson slightly taken aback. Almost forgot, he still has members of the July Club under his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although \"Kately\" is a passive member of the July Society, he is also a member of the July Society. Now that I'm in the Northland, I will have something to do in July, and maybe I will contact him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring him in!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sad look between his brows still reveals that he is not in a good mood at the moment. Intuition told him that the matter was far from over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, I just received a secret letter. That guy Long Xi wants me to persuade you to take action against the five Dukes of the Northland to avenge their blood revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They wrote in the letter that the five dukes of the North had colluded with the orcs, and that the orcs had instructed the five dukes to do it this time by agitating the army to break through. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Kettley handed the letter to Hudson. The trembling of his hands proved that his heart was very hesitant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The establishment of the July Society is to avenge the five families in the Northland. From the perspective of composition, Hudson and them should be regarded as the same people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking through the family tree, maybe a dozen generations ago, everyone was still relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that they chose to lurk in the Northland looking for opportunities for revenge, and the Koslow family chose to go south, or in other words, all the direct descendants in the Northland died, and only the southern branch survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the contents of the letter, Hudson's expression didn't change at all. It has never been a secret that the five giants in the North have connections with orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smuggling trade has been going on for so many years, if there is no contact between the two parties, then there is a real problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling your teammates in exchange for your own way of life is nothing. Don't talk about principles, when it comes to life and death, few people can remain calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the operations of the Liaodong Jiangmen Group in history, they still have a bottom line. It's just to encourage the army to break through, not to stab one's own people as a traitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is not enough evidence!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobility has never lacked a dark history. Almost all the great nobles have a lot of bad things under their buttocks. As long as you don't lift the lid, it doesn't exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to use these stains to attack the enemy, the biggest problem is-\"evidence\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have sufficient evidence in your hand, choose a suitable time to show it, even if it is stronger than the five giants of the Northland, they will not be able to eat it, and they will walk around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the information in the hands of the July Society alone can only prove that there was a connection between the five major families in the Northland and the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of crime, for ordinary people, is like ransacking their homes. Put it on these great nobles, at most it will be criticized a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that it is precisely because of this that they choose to take the risk to find Hudson to cooperate, and take advantage of this opportunity to lay hands on the children of the five major families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fireball flashed, and the letter was instantly reduced to ashes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “For this matter, just pretend nothing happened. If they contact you again, tell them: The risk is too great, and I am not interested in participating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are entangled, you can reason: You have not gained my trust, and your words do not have enough weight. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    July Club wants to seek revenge from the five major families in the Northland, and he is also happy to see it succeed, but it is still unnecessary to take the initiative to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lochnard family alone is enough for him to have a headache, if a few more enemies are added, it will be even more difficult to mix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High position and weight, many soldiers and generals are all illusions. In essence, the foundation of Hudson is still very weak, and it will collapse if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army under his command was improvised, and he obeyed the command because he was the highest military commander appointed by the kingdom, and he was not loyal at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long way to escape, the Northern Expeditionary Army has long been disintegrated. Many people are running around in all directions, and those who can live to this day are considered lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of orcs, there is no distinction between nobles and commoners, as long as the human race is the target of their slaughter. At most, when chasing the northern nobles, they deliberately put some water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chased and fled all the way to the present, the coalition of nobles from the southeast provinces gathered together, but there is no one in ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeast province sent strong soldiers, and a county randomly selected is all elite, it is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only after fighting the orcs that everyone realized the difference in strength between the two sides. Not to mention the comparison with the elite orcs, even compared with the ordinary army of the Northland, there is still a big gap between them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County's army can fight, because the \"Knight of the Bow\" has a strong military command ability, so change the commander and do whatever you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no one dared to say it, deep down, everyone criticized Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson can play, and throwing him to the Principality of Moxi, isn't he deliberately cheating his teammates?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky Sis was the one who drew lots, so if he wants to go, he should let him go. If it wasn't for Earl Pierce's selfish intentions to release the water on purpose, Sith, who was the sheriff, would not be able to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many nobles, if the \"Knight of the Bow\" was left in the coalition of nobles in the southeastern province, it would be a different scene now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Head-to-head with orcs, everyone may have limited ability. But when it comes to the ability to hug their thighs, none of them is worse than the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I think of the barons and knights who accompanied me to the expedition, and now have mixed army commanders, I feel endless annoyance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, it is all caused by being too close. As old neighbors, everyone knows very well what the former Wrightshire Army, the now prestigious First Army Army Army Corps, is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching a group of guys who are not as good as him, one by one, get ahead, but they are still running for their lives, and there is endless resentment in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce was also very depressed about this change. I thought that a death mission was arranged, but I didn't expect that the damned didn't die. They thought they were safe, but they were forced to the cliff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fleeing all the way to the present, the famous Crimson Knights under his command have been reduced by more than half. The private armies of other nobles suffered heavy losses, none of them existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to persevere until now is because there are no ordinary people who have followed the team to the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serf soldiers were either buried under the butcher's knives of the orcs, or fell behind on the way to escape and scattered on the vast prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, good news! A large group of cavalry appeared fifty miles ahead, flying the flag of the Earl of Hudson, and the corresponding troops are coming!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scout's words brightened the eyes of the fleeing crowd, but then their expressions dimmed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcements did come, but not the reinforcements they wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both come from the southeast province, and everyone originally had a love for each other, but the love is not as important as the benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Koslow family wants to rise, it will inevitably expand their territory abroad. However, all the land in the southeastern province now has owners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson wants to maximize his interests after the war, he has to send them to death. Transposition, they will do the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be a bit unbearable to go directly to the black hand, but there will be no hesitation in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you been in contact with Earl Hudson?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that Hudson might be able to accommodate other small and medium-sized nobles, but he, the boss, was a thorn in the other side's side and a thorn in his flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldier in charge of the investigation said in a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how slow the reaction was, he knew that he had said something wrong just now. But they couldn't figure out why the faces of the aristocrats were so gloomy and terrifying that the reinforcements were right in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Earl Pierce's expression softened slightly, he waved his hand and said, \"Okay, there's nothing else going on here, let's go down and rest first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere became tense again, everyone was waiting for Earl Pierce's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After a short rest, we continued on our way. It is estimated that the orc cavalry behind us are almost resting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no accidents, there is still a fierce battle to be fought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't panic too much. The kingdom sent troops to support them. There will not only be one team, but we will meet them again soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There aren't too many pursuers, as long as a few thousand fresh troops join us, we don't have to be afraid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, you can also see it. The enemy has been trying to avoid casualties as much as possible, and the orcs can't afford to lose! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't rant, your author has won the prize again. After the National Day, the fourth round of closures is coming... This place is poisonous, and I will move when the rent is due, woo woo woo...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is suspected to be the coalition of nobles in the southeastern province. It is currently being hunted down by the orc army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, the air became heavy. They all stared at Hudson as if there was something in his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter which army it is, send someone to inform them first, and let them stand still and wait for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was sent down, and after resting in place for two hours, the army pulled out of camp and set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all go down and prepare, don't delay the rescue time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's mouths became O-shaped, and they swallowed the words when they reached their mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the subordinates left, but brothers Nelson and Evora stayed. Obviously, they were also full of doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are no outsiders here now, so if you want to ask anything, just ask! There is no need to hide it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received Hudson's signal, Evola, who was impatient at first, couldn't help asking immediately: \"Hudson, are we really going to rescue them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One lion group cannot hold two lion kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is destined to have only one boss. As latecomers, the Koslow family either chose to leave and start another business, or challenge the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the difficulty of starting a new business, the mature southeastern province is obviously more attractive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply considering the economic situation, the southeast province can surpass the sum of three or four provinces in the north, and this is still based on the development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current strength of the Koslow family, they simply do not have the ability to develop a northern province. All branches invested at all costs, and Dingtian also developed a county in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are better choices, only fools choose to come to the north for development. With the same cost input, Hudson might as well use it to develop the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years, taking back the ancestral land has long become a slogan to unite the family's centripetal force. Except for the older generation, the younger generation hardly liked the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the opportunity has come, as long as they don't save themselves and sit back and watch the Dalton family have an accident, the Koslow family can take advantage of the trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the province, that can only be regarded as their bad luck. What's more, as a new political faction, Hudson also needs a place to house his younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to take advantage of the opportunity to kill people with a knife and cleanse the interior of the southeastern province is simply perfect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nonsense, I have given orders, can I go back on my word?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of unnutritious words can be asked. He very much doubts whether Evora's brain is not fully developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, he wonders why there is such a big gap between the children born to the same parents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss, Nelson, is full of mind. Although limited by his childhood education and limited horizons, his overall ability is still good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I arrived at Evora, I went directly to the other extreme. He can move anything, but he can't use his brain. He is a proper reckless man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, such a good opportunity, if you miss it, if you want to meet again next time, then...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Nelson finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Opportunities and risks always exist together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decline of the Dalton family is indeed what I want to see, but it is definitely not now, let alone decline in this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not only our people in this army, but also people from many other forces, including people from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the watchful eyes of everyone, if I make excuses and refuse to send troops to rescue, what do you think will happen?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if the Dalton family is really finished, we will be able to swallow the benefits they left behind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop having such sweet dreams!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The background of the Koslow family, supporting a middle-class noble is already the limit. Now every step forward, we have to face obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more we come to this kind of time, the more cautious we have to be. Especially in the face of interests, we must abide by our duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What other great nobles can do does not mean that we can do it now. As a new member, before integrating into the circle and building your own network, the most important thing is your duty!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must not touch things that we shouldn't touch! If you touch it, it will be the end of our Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that since the establishment of the kingdom, there has not been a single big noble that has climbed up from a small noble all the way. The ups and downs among the great nobles all happened within the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think they would welcome us in? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the pie is big, the Koslow family has bad teeth. Wanting to swallow the southeast province in one bite is purely like a snake swallowing an elephant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the allied forces of the nobles in the southeast province were wiped out, the remaining strength in their lair would be enough to drag the Koslow family down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of \"power\" is not only military strength, but also political influence and personal connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to pay the price, you can easily bring in a bunch of reinforcements with the connections of veteran nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people can be domestic or foreign. The Alpha Kingdom's vitality has been seriously injured, but it does not mean that the nobles of all ethnic countries have suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big Macs like the Dalton family have not been limited to the Alpha Kingdom for a long time, and they also have a lot of connections in other countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship network is not strong enough, there is no way to carry out cross-border maritime trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't even dare to play casually without knowing the other people's hole cards. Even if it is done in secret, it has to be done in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he integrates into the circle of great nobles, Hudson must be a great and respected nobleman, and he must not leave any handles to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By Xueyue Lake, the coalition army of nobles from the southeastern provinces was still caught by the orc cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two sides has been shortened to less than ten miles. It can be said that the orcs can catch up with one charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, two human cavalry galloped towards the army from a distance. Before the person arrived, the voice had already passed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Army ahead, listen up: We are ordered by the Earl of Hudson to inform you to stand on the spot, and reinforcements will arrive soon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Earl Pierce didn't feel the slightest bit of relief, but instead looked disgusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry in the coalition army can't outrun the cavalry, \"stand still and wait for help\", it sounds like there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite is: both parties can trust each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What both parties lack the most is trust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who would foolishly save their enemies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is necessary to send troops to rescue, it will be all kinds of passive sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Front Army, Earl Pierce. Did the rescue army set off before you set off?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Earl Pierce reported himself, he asked a tentative question. The messenger, who didn't know what he said, replied honestly: \"The army is resting, and it will arrive in two hours.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, I set off after two hours of rest, and there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, people are not machines, and soldiers must be restored to their condition before the war. It's not an urgent moment, and it's not a problem to delay for a few hours by forming an array and standing still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back and tell Earl Hudson that we will wait for him here and let him speed up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a slight smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the unnatural corners of the mouth, making the smile full of irony. It's a pity that not two messengers can understand all of this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl, we will truthfully convey your meaning to Earl Hudson.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, the two of them rode away without the slightest hesitation. Bringing professionalism to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the two of them disappear into the sky, Earl Pierce glanced back at the noble officers behind him and said, \"You all heard the conversation just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements are still resting, and they will set off after another two hours of rest. Considering the distance between us, we can meet each other within three hours at the fastest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to shorten the meeting time, we can't just wait here. Send the order to let the army speed up and join the reinforcements as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it was converging, but if you look carefully, you will find that there is a \"slight\" deviation between the road chosen by Earl Pierce and the direction in which the orderly left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direction of this thing, starting with a \"little bit\" deviation, after a certain distance, it becomes a \"billion point\" deviation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that Pierce can't believe Hudson's promised rescue. The thing that pitted teammates on the battlefield happened not only once or twice in the Kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that they stand still and wait for help, in case Hudson plays some tricks and deliberately leads the army to go a little bit in the wrong direction, and fails to arrive at the scheduled location at the scheduled time, it is also reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is quite normal to get lost in an unfamiliar land. The most serious consequence is nothing more than dumping the blame on a certain leading soldier who \"died in battle\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson might lead the team off track, Earl Pierce decided to give him a positive. After proper analysis, he decisively chose a path that was most likely to be encountered in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how you look at Hudson, it is not pleasing to the eye. Before encountering other reinforcements from the kingdom, this team was still their life-saving straw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the orc army is brought to the frontier guards, Hudson can't help watching the excitement. As for the meeting of the two armies, Earl Pierce still rejected it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is an interest. Now Hudson is the commander-in-chief of the enemy, controlling all the kingdom's troops on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Northern Expeditionary Army does not belong to the border guards, as the front-line coach, Hudson can still forcibly order them to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be a head short of others is a big deal to laugh it off; to be a head short of Hudson is a serious political accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will directly affect the ranks of nobles in the southeastern provinces. Except for the die-hard supporters, everyone else will become hesitant to stand in line, instead of falling to the Dalton family unconditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just these minor troubles, Earl Pierce can still find a way to solve them. What worries him most is the safety issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too easy for the coach to wear small shoes for his subordinates. If the strength in his hand is not damaged, he can still not buy Hudson's account, and even openly sing the opposite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately not now. With only a few remnants of the aristocratic coalition forces in the southeastern provinces, it is difficult to win much right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time flies, and two hours passed by. According to the previous agreement, the rescue army embarked on the journey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a coach who promises everything, Hudson will naturally abide by the agreement. The only difference is that the army did not gallop all the way on the horses, but struggled on the backs of the weak horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Save the stamina of the horse, which is what all cavalry units must face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if many warhorses in the army have the blood of monsters, their endurance and explosive power have been greatly improved, but more of them are ordinary warhorses that are lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens that the speed of the army is determined by these ordinary war horses that are holding back. It is natural to use rough horses to travel in the army, which has become the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is slow, that's okay. If you can send troops to rescue in time, you have fulfilled your obligation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, something is wrong! The aristocratic allied forces in the southeastern province are missing.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
