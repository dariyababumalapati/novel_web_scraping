It doesn't matter to all the married nobles, it's just for fun anyway, and it doesn't hurt to add a romantic affair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a single nobleman, Hudson has no way to follow suit. It would be embarrassing if someone misfired and was chased to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have not happened before. In order to marry into a wealthy family, it is normal to use some small tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the probability of success is low, there are still successful cases after all. Minor aristocrats and married aristocrats are not the goals of singers, but it is not necessarily the case if they go higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This can be seen from their different attitudes towards everyone. It's a pity that the guy with the upper brain never thinks so much, he just wants to have an affair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the opponents are too strong. They are all beautiful women who have undergone professional training to capture the hearts of men, and all of them are proficient in the thoughts of men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you want to get it, the more you can't get it. On the contrary, in front of the unmoved Hudson, divas come and hang around from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elegantly named, attracted by the heroic appearance of the Earth Bear. But the question is when did Bear Stearns become a hero?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there is no lack of Yingyingyanyan around the rich children like Viscount Cayo and Viscount Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these guys are lustful, but the overall performance is still mostly restrained. Although he did not refuse the temptation delivered to his door, he did not rush forward desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know whether it's because they are well-informed or have experienced professional training. These wealthy children are much more resistant to beauty than ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except Isabel is not included here. In the face of this special stunner, the children of the wealthy family did not have much resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson saw some noble children going up to propose marriage on the spot. The result is naturally self-evident, a good person card was issued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Things, how far has it progressed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An icy voice rang in her ears, Isabel turned her beautiful eyes, and gave the visitor a hard look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that in the vicious eyes, there is still affection mixed in. Obviously, this is the charm that has been integrated into the bones, every frown, smile, joy and anger are all coquettish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A normal man, who can bear it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shadow Killer, you don't want to die! There is an Earth Bear in the camp. If you sneak in at this time, you won't be afraid of being stunned by Bear...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Isabel finished speaking, the shadow man interrupted: \"Don't worry, the organization definitely knows more about the Earth Bear than you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What I entered was your tent, not that of Mr. Hudson. The lazy earth bear doesn't have the habit of peeking around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless that Master Hudson is obsessed with you to the extreme, let the Earth Bear help you watch. If you really want to reach that point, even if you are discovered, you will be able to settle the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, my current identity is the servant of Divas. It makes sense to be related to you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Isabel rolled her eyes directly. He said angrily: \"Since you are so powerful, then go over and take care of it yourself, why do you need me to do it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl was poorly educated, unable to take on this important task, and failed to take this person down. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of this anger was directed at Yingsha, and the other half was directed at Hudson. A delicate beauty performed several times, but she was still unmoved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Isabel hadn't been sure that Hudson's body was responding, and she just suppressed it with willpower, she would have doubted whether Hudson was a man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a miracle that there are men in this world that you, Isabel, can't handle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shadow man said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this scene fell into Isabel's eyes, but her eyes were wide open, looking back and forth curiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now she finally understands why she can't seduce the shadow man. After a long time, this guy is not a real man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What to look at, don't forget that your task is to find out as soon as possible whether Viscount Hudson has the Horn of the Blood Moon in his hand.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shadow man reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't need to talk nonsense, I naturally know the mission. But that Viscount Hudson is hard to deal with!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously already moved, but still forcibly suppressed the desire, pretending to be unmoved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like you don't know how perverted the nobles are. Some ruthless guys, in order to hone their character, they can even the woman they love...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through speaking, Isabel stomped her feet fiercely. In the depths of my heart, I secretly complained, maybe I also encountered a pervert!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a large team of knights escorting, the journey is naturally smooth. No matter how desperate bandits and bandits are, they are not stupid enough to deliberately give away their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrived at the capital, and bid farewell to the ladies and sisters of the diva group amidst the reluctance of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming Isabel's resentful eyes, Hudson always felt that the matter would not end so soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Have you taken a fancy to him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is too weird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't deny love at first sight, but it's very funny that a woman in the entertainment industry will fall in love at first sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the appearance alone, Hudson is just a middle-aged figure. Not ugly, not handsome enough to effervescent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to attract the favor of noble ladies is more due to the temperament bonus brought by strength and status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are very attractive to immature little girls, but they are not enough to meet a top singer like Isabel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't love at first sight, it was just for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few spies who have infiltrated the Mountain Territory, but Hudson has never encountered such a force as a pawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that I'm underestimating myself, but I really don't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobles, there is no love and hate for no reason, and there are only a few things that the mountain receivers conspire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't let go of everything. Even if Isabel seduces her, she won't be able to move the territory!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson felt as if he had discovered the truth, but there was another barrier between him and the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When we arrived at the capital, it was time for everyone to part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the time to show their strength. Families with strength have their own residences in the capital, while nobles without strength can only stay in hotels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is sandwiched between the two. As the family with the widest distribution of members, the capital naturally has no shortage of members of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a resident, so it's hard to say. From the perspective of regulations alone, it is a common people's courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to live in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy for aristocrats who are not wealthy to buy real estate that matches their status here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not bad to have a place to stay. Hudson is not picky, let alone picky capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the cheapest Viscount's mansion costs tens of thousands of gold coins. Don't be too expensive, as soon as this kind of housing comes out, it will be snatched up immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, very few noble mansions will be traded on the market. No matter how short of money, no one would sell the mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the foreign nobles live in hotels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hotels with good conditions are not much worse than palaces. It's just that the price is quite unbeautiful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to move in, money is not enough. No matter what kind of status, you can only live in a room of the corresponding grade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscounts like Hudson used to live in the Viscount Castle with 30 gold coins per day, or a lower-grade room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you save face, the cheapest knight room is only 3 gold coins per day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doubts very much whether those low-level poor ghost knights can earn 3 gold coins a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also admires the owner of the hotel who has calculated the comparison of nobles and created this business model.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Imitation is impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of business model cannot be imitated by ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the backstage is not strong enough, the nobles in the store will make a fuss, but it will not end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small courtyard of the common people is the small courtyard of the common people. In order not to pay the IQ tax, Hudson didn't bother to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be exact - full house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family received the news too late, and their network of contacts in the capital was very stretched, so they couldn't get a room for Hudson at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small courtyard was renovated not long ago, and you can see that it was done with care. Although he is not worthy of the status of viscount, he is still satisfied with Hudson, who has low living conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a night of rest, he was notified early the next morning and entered the palace to rehearse the conferring ceremony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting this answer, Hudson was dumbfounded. Feelings reached the continent of Aslante, and they didn't escape...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So anxious, naturally the team from the southeast province came late. Originally at the normal speed, it must have arrived early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there were more singers on the way, and the forward speed dropped from hundreds of miles a day to dozens of miles a day, and the time consumed naturally increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only eight days left before the canonization time. If you don't rehearse well in advance, if something goes wrong in the ceremony, it will be an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no accidents, and the participants in the rehearsal were all small and medium nobles. As for the great His Majesty the King, naturally there is no need to engage in such nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the guidance of the etiquette officer, Hudson followed the team for a whole morning like a wooden man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning. In the next few days, I will come over every day to practice again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was able to end early because he was a viscount, and he was considered to be of a higher status among the canonized nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The barons and knights below are even worse, especially the lowest-ranking knights, who basically line up all day long. We need to wait for the previous nobles to be canonized before it will be their turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, they can come back in the afternoon. It is a pity that the upright etiquette officials admit to death and must restore the scene of the canonization ceremony as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the absence of Caesar III, the other processes are basically intact real-scene simulations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to visit the palace, but after thinking about it, Hudson dismissed the idea. No need to think about it, the guards would not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone can run around in the palace, then it is not the palace, but the vegetable market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, Miss Melissa, please?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just returned to the station, ready to change into normal clothes and go out for a walk, when I received this unexpected news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too much of a coincidence that Hudson didn't think too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was not there when we were discussing marriage, but just after the announcement of the postponement of the wedding, he happened to come back, as if he was trying to avoid it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, going to the Warcraft Mountains to practice was a unified arrangement of the Academy of Magic. As a cute young magician, Melissa doesn't have the ability to influence the college's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Holliser family doesn't have such a big face now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the familiar small characters on the parchment, after confirming that someone was not playing a prank, Hudson changed his clothes and went straight to the Academy of Magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lush poplars, the vibrant lawn, the scent of violets, and the apple trees not far away are still hanging red fruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the biting cold wind, Hudson couldn't believe it was winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vitality of spring, the prosperity of summer, the harvest of autumn, and the bleakness of winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All gathered together, such an abnormal scene did not arouse people's surprise, just because this is - Magic Academy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the oldest and most prosperous institution in the Alpha Kingdom, any supernatural phenomenon happening here can only be considered normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting again, the relationship between the two has undergone a qualitative change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the noble marriage is announced to the outside world, there is basically no need to go back on it. The difference between a fiancée and a husband and wife is only a wedding ceremony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After looking at each other, the two of them were awkwardly together, not knowing what to say for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why did you come back from the experience so quickly, didn't you say it would last for half a year?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Something happened in the Warcraft Mountains, a dragon appeared from nowhere and fought with two earth bears, causing the Warcraft in the area to panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the peripheral area of ​​our experience, intermediate and high-level monsters also frequently appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three students failed to send a signal for help in time, and after an accident, the senior management of the college postponed the experience. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa narrated slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the expression of fear and anxiety, one can also detect the trace of fear in the eyebrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this experience is not as easy as she said. There is a high probability that he has witnessed some dangerous scenes with his own eyes, which makes him so frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not surprised that a giant dragon singled out two earth bears. As the most powerful creature in this world, the giant dragon has always been the ceiling of combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bears claim to be able to single out giant dragons, but they have a fatal flaw, that is, they cannot fly in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When creatures on the ground fight with creatures in the sky, it is obvious that they suffer. But if it's two against one, then it's not sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, they are all top extraordinary creatures, they belong to the top of the food chain, and their strength still depends on the development of the individual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft of the same category and realm have different strengths. Demon beasts who know how to practice hard are often more powerful than lazy ones who rely solely on talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ultimate growth limit of Warcraft depends not only on talent, but also on whether you work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This aspect is essentially the same as people. It's just that the lower limit of Warcraft is very high, and they are born with extraordinary power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter if it's postponed, the Warcraft Mountains are still too dangerous for junior magicians like you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is experience, I am afraid it will be difficult to gain anything. It's better to wait until the strength is strong, and then go to experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is already very tense, and war may break out at any time, so there is no need to worry about not having a chance to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While talking, Hudson realized something was wrong. It looks like I'm out on a date, so why talk about these irrelevant topics?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, arranged marriages are popular in the continent of Aslante, and they pay attention to being well-matched. Hard conditions are a hundred times more important than rhetoric.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that there are not too many opportunities for contact between men and women. If the two families hadn't decided to get married, walking around the campus alone would cause gossip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For unmarried aristocratic men and women, gossip is a symbol of improper private life. Once the notoriety is tainted, it will be difficult to get a good marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either lower the standard, or combine with a guy who is also indiscreet in his private life, in short, there is no good fruit to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can you tell me what happened to Isabel?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa's words pulled Hudson back from his imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news spread too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, those nobles were not the ones who could keep it secret. Fortunately, he restrained his desire and did not mess around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's just a beautiful singer, trying to reach the sky in one step!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that it is best to shake the pot clean at this time. Although he didn't do anything, it doesn't mean that no one is making up stories behind his back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jealousy is an original sin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had the opportunity to get close to Isabel, although Hudson gave up, but the hatred was still drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is more likely that Melissa's other suitors did the trick. Hudson is not the only one who has thoughts about the Holliser family, and there are definitely not a few people who want to marry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can stand out. In addition to the mutual interests of the two parties, his legendary experience is also a major plus point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous wars with the orcs, the casualty rate of nobles remained high. Marriage is now a gamble. If you are unlucky, you will directly die as a widow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Aslant Continent does not exclude widows from remarrying, and some families with few children even select widows who can bear children, but it is only a minority after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most noble men and women, the marriage after widowhood will be lowered by a grade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to mention gambling. After the previous wars, the ratio of men to women will be seriously out of balance. A large number of noble ladies can't find a partner, so they can only become nuns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the family, it is undoubtedly a waste of resources to give up the alliance brought about by the in-law relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all gambling anyway, so naturally you have to pick the bet with the highest chance of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that a lucky and powerful guy like Hudson is the first choice of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, it better be like this.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"By the way, Hudson, last time you said you were going to visit the library. It's hard to come to the Academy of Magic, why don't you go and have a look?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poor acting skills concealed the embarrassment, so naturally it couldn't be hidden from Hudson's eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that it's rare to be confused about this kind of thing. As a creature with a single mother and fetus, he doesn't want to make any troubles because of his upright character, which will cause the marriage to change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"OK!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, Hudson realized that something was wrong. It seemed that they had already reached the door of the library.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The library of the Academy of Magic is naturally full of magic. As an outsider, Hudson was directly blocked at the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please pay the entrance fee of 50 gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mechanical sound sounded, and Hudson realized that the toll collector in front of him was actually a mechanical puppet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking a look at Melissa, she made sure that there was no problem. Hudson paid directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome to the library of the Magic Academy of the Alpha Kingdom, please abide by all the rules in the library! Violators will bear the consequences!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warning sounded, and a huge sign appeared in front of it, which recorded various rules that needed to be followed, and there were dozens of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although it is not considered as strong as a cloud, there are definitely many masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doing things here is definitely a sign of tiredness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't the price too expensive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has heard that learning magic is a gold-swallowing behemoth, the price still scares him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The books that only record knowledge are so expensive to borrow once. If you go to class every day to study, wouldn't the expenses be even more expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These prices are for outsiders, and our internal college has credits. You can get credits by completing the corresponding studies, or accepting some college tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the credits are not enough, will the gold coins be used to buy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price, you've seen, is worse than a robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic research is very expensive, not only us students are poor, but also the instructors in the academy and even the school itself are poor. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa half explained, half complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting a definite answer, Hudson was speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the opening of the library by the Academy of Magic was mainly to show a tolerant attitude, but he didn't expect that he was thinking too much, and they just wanted to take advantage of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who don't know just came here and thought they could read all the magic knowledge for a fee of 50 gold coins, so they would pay obediently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying the money, they will find that there are countless big pits in the future, just waiting for them to jump into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to regret it, either give up the 50 gold coin admission fee and admit it, or continue to spend money to learn magic knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Academy of Magic does not refund money. If there is an objection, first check whether your fist is hard enough, and then consider whether to ask for an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ignored Melissa's \"poor\". There are no poor ghosts who can learn magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at this money-hungry library, Hudson knows how much money the Academy of Magic can make. Students who don't have a solid family background can't get along here at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the Magic Academy seldom enrolls civilians for this reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family is not well-off, and I am busy earning points all day long. No matter how good the talent is, once the resources can't keep up, the gap will still be widened by others in the later stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called free gifted students only exist in theory. The free content is limited to the most basic courses, and the follow-up knowledge still has to be exchanged at an equivalent value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems reasonable, but in essence, those with vested interests do not want to add a bunch of competitors, which will affect their own interests, and deliberately raise the barriers to entry infinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic academy in front of you is a true portrayal of the times, and it seems that everyone can enter. But the reality is that even if ordinary people come in, they still have to spend a lot of time earning points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic research, that is purely a joke. It can range from a few gold coins to as many as hundreds of thousands of gold coins for a magic experiment. What can ordinary people afford?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The true meaning of magic is not easy to pursue. If you don't toss about many things yourself, you will never be able to recognize the essence of magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early stage of cultivation, these problems are not prominent, but when it comes to higher-level research later, these shortcomings are fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an extraordinary power, a lot of knowledge in the field of magic can only be understood and cannot be conveyed in words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the same magical rules fall into the eyes of different people, the final harvest will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just a few words described in the book, which is only the original author's comprehension. Latecomers can only learn from it, but it is impossible to copy it intact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that I shouldn't come in with you today.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the knowledge that is itchy, but have no money to learn, this kind of feeling is really not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back at the vast sea of ​​books, Hudson doubted very much that even if he lost his fortune, he would not be able to finish his studies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cheapest basic knowledge starts with three digits, and one can imagine how expensive the high-end knowledge is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Properly confirms the sentence-knowledge is the most precious wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hee hee! Every magician who has come here will say that he shouldn't come. But before he came, he couldn't help thinking about coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No magician can resist the temptation of the true meaning of magic. How can he be willing if he doesn't know the largest magic library in the palace?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at these things as expensive, if you are not a noble of the kingdom, even if you have money, you can't buy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But basic knowledge, so there is no need to waste money here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At home, I almost learned it. If you want to know anything, you can ask me, provided I remember.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, almost every big noble family has collections of knowledge here, but none of them are complete here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some new research and development results are unique to the college. Wanting to acquire this knowledge, even the great nobles would feel pain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speaker may not have the intention, but the listener has the intention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't think Melissa invited him over just to see his jokes. Tossing her fiancé, if she really made a fool of herself, it would be embarrassing for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of nobles are precocious, and Hudson prefers to believe that this is a deliberately arranged display of self-worth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the great nobles, what the Koslow family lacks most is not power, but knowledge inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a prosperous family, as long as the resources are sufficient, the growth rate of strength will never be slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the background can be inherited, so there is no way. Even if you want to go out and grab it, you won't be able to grab the truly precious knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic self-destruct device is just a pediatrics, and more importantly, whose important inheritance does not have a few pitfalls?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efforts made by the great nobles to protect the knowledge inherited by the family are by no means imaginable by ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't grab it, you can only trade it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the same circle, as long as the price is high enough, there is nothing that cannot be bought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to operate it is very challenging. Marriage is only one of the means, and Melissa's ability to bring basic knowledge of magic is enough to make the Koslow family pay the highest attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these basic knowledge can be obtained from the library with money, the price is really expensive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"With so much knowledge that can be sold, and the huge funding from the kingdom, your academy should be rich, how can you say it's poor?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If there are many knowledge achievements, they must be sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the research and development results are meaningless, who wants to pay a big price?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What can really be sold is the basic knowledge on the table. Many newly rising nobles will send someone to copy a copy in order to enrich their background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the academy's income is very high, but it has to support a group of tutors who want to explore the true meaning of magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, once you indulge in magic research, there are not many people who are endless. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa spread her hands and said with a curled lip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it is difficult for a young girl like her to understand the fun of spending all day in the laboratory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of female magicians in the continent of Aslante, but very few of them are truly strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind almost every strong woman, there will be a story with twists and turns. There is no way for a smooth sailing noble lady to settle down to explore the true meaning of magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the topic is getting more and more off-track, I still remember that I am Hudson who came on a date, and said self-deprecatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go, take me away from this sad place. This kind of ghost place that only recognizes money is not for poor people like me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisure time is always short, rehearse every morning, and accompany the beauties to visit the capital in the afternoon, and the time will soon come to the canonization day—December 31, 99987 in the sacred calendar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Julius Caesar III personally selected the auspicious day for the zodiac, and God was also very generous, and a sunny day came directly in the cold winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like a rehearsal, Hudson lined up with the crowd, waiting for the arrival of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palace square is surrounded by crowds of spectators. The big scene only happens once every five years on average.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The extravagant wealthy businessmen even took out expensive photo stones for recording.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, just to make the recorded information more accurate, and to be able to open your eyes a little bit when encountering them in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the top of a building in the distance, the singers of Rainbow Moon also watched the excitement. Because of the distance, it is impossible to recognize even the figure, let alone hear the voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by their profession. As a member of a well-known singer group, they will attract the attention of the public wherever they go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of big day for the canonization of nobles is not something they can take away. If the onlookers watch closely and cause an accident to disrupt the canonization ceremony, it will be a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't see clearly, can't hear, the group of beautiful women who were enthusiastic before quickly lost interest and returned to their boudoir one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only Isabel stayed behind, looking enviously at the canonized crowd in the distance, and fell into endless contemplation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isabel, your progress is not very good. As soon as the canonization ceremony is over, that guy will return to the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Missed this opportunity, if you want to approach him in the future, it will not be so simple. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The urging voice without a trace of emotion rang from beside my ears, pulling Isabel who had fallen into fantasy back to reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at the person coming, Isabel turned her head angrily, and said angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just go back, this **** task cannot be accomplished by humans!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that she doesn't work hard, it's just that she doesn't have a chance to perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arriving in the capital these days, Hudson entered the palace to rehearse in the morning, and wandered around with his fiancée in the afternoon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arranged several chance encounters, but at the last moment, Isabel was forced to cancel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how charming she is, she can't show it in front of her fiancee!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting such an opponent, Isabel was also very helpless. If the mission rewards this time were not so enticing, she would have quit long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's late! The mission of the organization is never left halfway. In any case, it must be checked whether the Blood Moon Horn is in the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The above is already considering the possibility of purchasing the Blood Moon Horn. You can tentatively negotiate with the mountain viscount, if the price is not high, it's okay to buy it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shadow man said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his life creed, there is no concept of \"failure\". The brand that the mission is greater than the sky has long been engraved in his bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since his debut, although he has not completed the task 100%, but it is the first time that Shadow Killer has encountered such an embarrassing situation that he has been tossing for several months without even contacting the parties involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop dreaming!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think I'm a fool?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or is that mountain viscount a fool? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel mocked unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon Horn\", how can a singer be contaminated. I'm afraid that as soon as he talks about the price, his identity will be exposed in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a smart person, Isabel never puts herself in danger. She didn't dare to bet that she could escape unscathed after revealing her identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buy it cheap, it's even more nonsense. Anyone who gets this kind of bargaining chip will sell it for a good price. There is no reason to sell it cheaply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to put pressure on the other party, you have to show your organization name to see if you can suppress them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the mysterious organization dare not put itself under the sun at all. Intimidation, of course, is out of the question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Try it, with your ability, even if the mission fails, he will not be willing to kill you, we will organize the rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the upcoming celebration banquet, I will try to distract his fiancée and create opportunities for you. But in terms of time, you have to hurry up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was obviously agitation, but when it was spoken from Yingsha's blunt mouth, the taste changed instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"knew!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel said with a flick of her skirt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She only believed half of what Yingsha said. Reason told her that it should be true to create opportunities next, but there is no need to take the promised rescue seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since she joined the mysterious organization, she has never seen the rescue of captured intelligence personnel, but the scene of silence has caught up twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you join a mysterious organization, you can't turn back. Even though she knew that the task was very difficult, Isabel could only bite the bullet now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the mysterious organization can't deal with the big noble, but it couldn't be easier to handle a little singer like her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to send other people, the guy who \"come without a trace, go without a trace\" in front of him can kill her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Canonize Hudson-Koslow as Viscount!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After waiting for several hours, Caesar III just waited for such a sentence. Kneeling down on one knee to receive the knight sword, the canonization ceremony is considered complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not a single word of encouragement or inspiration. If you communicate with each other, it doesn't exist anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the traditional hand kiss was omitted. The complicated ceremony that colleagues rehearse first is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Caesar III is really a resolute monarch. The canonization ceremony was reduced to the extreme, and the original fancy ceremony was all condensed into one sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not according to the traditional rules, but now he is the rules. It seems that the change is just for laziness, but it is actually another oath of kingship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With practical actions, he told a group of newly-canonized nobles that he was the boss of Caesar III in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Twists and turns, maybe there have been before! Anyway, everyone is happy to accept it now, and no one thinks that what Caesar III did was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or even if I have thoughts in my heart, I hold back now and dare not say it in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone who accepted the canonization together can accept it, let alone Hudson. It is king to finish the ceremony early and go home after work. He doesn't want to perform a monkey show here for everyone to watch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the knighting ceremony is the most glorious moment in a nobleman's life, Hudson, who is afraid of trouble, thinks it is better to keep everything simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simple ritual means high efficiency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, Caesar III read the list himself, but when it came time to confer the knights later, because there were too many people, he simply gave up the power to read the list to the officials in charge of ceremonies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knighting ceremony, which would have lasted several days, was actually completed within three hours by Caesar III. Hudson and others waited so long because the king was late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether intentional or unintentional, the boss can be late at will, but the younger brother must come early to wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the majesty of kingship with his own eyes, Hudson finally understood why so many people wanted to seize the throne throughout the ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is the continent of Aslante, and it is not popular to talk about princes and generals, otherwise, the big nobles of the Alpha Kingdom who support their own soldiers would have fallen out of the sky long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The canonization ceremony is over, and the next is the celebration banquet, you can take your seats!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said kindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe he is happy that he has completed today's heavy work, or maybe he is happy that he has added a group of younger brothers. In short, he is in a good mood now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the king who didn't follow the routine to leave, the pot exploded directly below, and each small circle started their own discussions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the canonized protagonists, Hudson, who was in the front position, saw the ceremonial officer in charge of the ceremony with his own eyes, and his face was green with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Caesar III changed the rules temporarily, and even the officials who presided over the etiquette were not notified in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the king was here just now, everyone didn't dare to be too obvious. Now that the man is gone, they start to show their true feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major event involving the canonization of noble titles will inevitably be recorded in the annals of history. This kind of unconventional and unconventional performance, someone has to be responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host of the ceremony, he is the best blame man. At the very least, curses appeared in Hudson's ears, and they were basically directed at the etiquette officer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Caesar III, at most, there are a few criticisms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't want to scold the king, but in the continent of Aslante, as a vassal, he is not qualified to scold the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pick up the bowl to eat, put down the bowl and scold your mother\". Nobles who haven't completely lost their moral bottom line still can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The essence is to safeguard their own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the king is too jumpy, and everyone will come to persuade him to get him back on the right track.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is harmony, there is only one explanation—the situation in northern Xinjiang is tense, and the kingdom needs to strengthen the centralization of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are precedents to follow. When the previous wars broke out, the power of the central government of the Alpha Kingdom would be strengthened so as to be able to better resist the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only exception was the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the king was too weak, the central government did not have enough prestige, and failed to coordinate the joint operations of the major forces, which led to the loss of cities and territories of the Alpha Kingdom and heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    learn from mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, even if everyone doesn't want to see Caesar III continue to strengthen the kingship, in order to better fight against the invasion of the orcs, the major forces can only hold their noses and recognize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, there will be various temptations and games to determine each other's bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the newly promoted middle nobles, Hudson is not yet qualified to participate in the high-level game, and all he can do is wait quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The welcome banquet for the newly promoted nobles is still of a very high standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of nobles gathered in the capital, and Caesar III also came in person and gave a passionate speech.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the capital of geniuses, the most eye-catching is no longer young talents like Hudson, but Princess Madeleine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real proud girl of heaven, she blew up the banquet scene as soon as she appeared on the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has seen a lot of beauties, but none of them can compare with Princess Madeleine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a matter of appearance. From the perspective of appearance and figure, Princess Madeleine is not top-notch, but there is one thing that makes up for all these deficiencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The innate noble temperament, even just a glance from a distance, can leave a deep impression on people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you looking at, you already have a fiancée.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The familiar voice in his ear pulled the intoxicated Hudson back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing who was coming, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, I thought that being caught by my fiancée would be a disaster for me, but I didn't expect that it was Isabel who was imitating Melissa's voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, you will scare people to death if you play like this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Divas take the artistic route, versatility is the basic quality, and it is not surprising that they can imitate shows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he couldn't figure out which power was full of food and sent such a stunner to stare at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also had deep doubts about the kingdom's security system, and actually allowed a singer to sneak in here disguised as a man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was an assassin, wouldn't Caesar III be dangerous?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, ordinary killers can't do anything if they get in. All the nobles present basically have such skills, so the **** should not be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, what are you talking about? I am Lord Isabel, not some lady!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if she put on men's clothes, she couldn't hide the obsequiousness all over her body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a deceitful explanation, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. If Princess Madeleine hadn't attracted everyone's attention, I'm afraid Isabel would have been recognized long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this explanation also explained why Isabel was able to sneak in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord\" in the Alpha Kingdom is a respectful title for noble men, and does not refer to a specific title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diva, has aristocratic status?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to make sense. When the forest is big, there are all kinds of birds, and when there are many nobles, all kinds of strange things will appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of a nobleman becoming a singer is very low, but it is not uncommon for a singer to become a nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some guys with brains on their brains often do things without going through their brains, and they can directly confer divas as nobles when they are happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of canonization is usually just a joke, and the mainstream circle will definitely not admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay then, my respected Lord Isabel. Did you try your best to sneak in because you wanted to win the favor of Princess Madeleine?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said slightly mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is good to favor beauties, but beauties with ulterior motives are another story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if she had touched a sore foot, Isabel's complexion suddenly became ugly. The rivalry between women is more serious than the comparison between men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Princess Madeleine, even though her figure and appearance were all dominant, she was still turned into a scum in seconds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that beauty and figure are worthless in front of temperament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if Isabel also has a father who is a king and a mother who is a queen, then everything is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, don't you want to get rid of me on purpose? Could it be that you want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Isabel deliberately narrowed the distance. The tangy aroma spread over, making Hudson very upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mind is very clear, but the body is a little bit overwhelmed, and the hormones secreted soar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Lord Isabel. I'm only interested in women, especially pretty women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm very busy now, this is not the place to talk about things, if there is anything we need to talk about separately after the banquet. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson quickly turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no shame in admitting desire, but being dominated by desire is a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a public place, and any untimely behavior may be noticed by interested people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Urgent military report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The griffin cavalry descended from the sky and landed on the square in front of the palace, and a sealed military report was passed to Caesar III by the guards as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is an urgent report from northern Xinjiang, the orcs are gathering troops to the front, the war has come!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet ended early, and the ministers followed me to hold an emergency meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All feudal nobles, immediately return to the territory to recruit troops and wait for the call of the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Caesar III brought an unsatisfactory end to the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military newspaper on the front line is the best hangover soup, which instantly wakes everyone up from their drunkenness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the big news of the orc invasion, no kind of woman is worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going back!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was very dissatisfied with the hastily ended trip to the capital. You must know that many of his plans have not yet been implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are people in the DPRK who are good at being officials, and an opportunity to make contacts and establish a network of relationships died prematurely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing can't be rushed, and making friends too deliberately will only make people feel disgusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early the next morning, Hudson and a group of nobles from the southeastern province set off to return, not even having time to say goodbye to Melissa.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is imminent, everything must serve the war, and everyone has no time to be hypocritical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can only entrust the tribe to handle the affairs in the royal capital. At this time, we can only believe in the power of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has been in decline for many years, but all the connections left by the ancestors have not been broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that I didn't have much contact. It was because I was a down-and-out relative, so I was embarrassed to come to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the world of nobility is real. Everyone will only play with the same kind of people who are of the same level and have a strong relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the little aristocrat insists on squeezing into the upper circle, it will only be annoying. Even if it is an in-law relationship, it will become impatient after a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status and status are not equal. With the death of the older generation, there will naturally be fewer direct walks, but the exchange of etiquette has not been interrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the Koslow family has returned, Hudson, who lacks connections, naturally wants to pick up this family legacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect to get much help, at least someone will lead the way, so as to avoid random collisions with black eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, and the relationship that can be maintained so far is basically the original close relatives-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hundred years is enough to change many people and things, even if it is the most recent one, it is the third generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was later, it is reckoned that this last connection would also slowly disappear in the years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, Crown Prince Alex's tent has arrived at the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Beamon's stand was too firm, and Alex, whose arms couldn't hold back his thighs, could only bite the bullet and go to the front to command the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it has been abandoned for decades, even if it is just acting, it can become a living habit branded on the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After leaving Yingyingyanyan in the mansion, Alex felt uncomfortable all over. Especially entering the barracks to command the army made him feel physically and mentally exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Butzweig, the pre-formation meeting of the five royal families is about to be held, and I won't be able to do it all at once. You will have to worry about military affairs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to leading troops to fight, Alex felt that in his current state, it was more appropriate to play politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political game on the front line is nothing more than a battle for the right to speak in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the five imperial courts, the Bimon Imperial Court will be able to take the biggest piece of cake regardless of the final outcome of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unified standard for the division of political interests. Ordinary people can't tell if they are making money or losing money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But leading troops to fight is different, that is to do it with real swords and guns, and it is clear at a glance if you lose the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince of the Beamon family, Alex, who lacks prestige, cannot bear the risk of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, no matter how much he fears the ability of the nephew in front of him, he can only entrust the affairs of the general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Highness the Crown Prince. I will take care of military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 20,000 troops of the Bimon family will arrive at the front line in ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 300,000 vassal race troops have now assembled 50,000 people, and the rest will be assembled within three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the 100,000 royal army stationed at the border, even our family is enough to launch a large-scale war against the human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a favorable contender for the throne of the Beamon Royal Court, Prince Butzweig came to the front line early to serve as governor in order to accumulate military merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Menghuang obviously likes his son more than Menghuang, and would rather push Alex, a trash recognized by the outside world, to the top, than give him a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was dissatisfied in his heart, he understood what Emperor Bimon did. The orc empire does not have so many moral and etiquette constraints, and the change of imperial power has never been peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to survive better than Emperor Meng, if he is replaced by a powerful crown prince, it is very likely that he will be in power because he cannot wait to launch a coup in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, it is easier to control such a waste snack as Alex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are sensual or not, I didn't expect him to be successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Prince Butzweig couldn't understand was why his shrewd grandfather sent this useless crown prince over to command the armed forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this rumored good-for-nothing uncle really only knows how to play with women. Although the ability to command troops is not up to the mark, the victory lies in knowing how to delegate power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Butzweig, this war is no different from previous temptations, and once it starts, it definitely won't end in a year or so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am thinner than the Meng family, and every soldier is precious, and must not be easily consumed on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families acted together, seemingly as close as one family, but in fact they were still fighting on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our enemies on the battlefield are not only humans, but also beware of knives from within.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you have a heavy responsibility, any negligence may cause heavy losses to my Beamon family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex reminded earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to keep hidden, but was pushed to the foreground, and he had to show some ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to pretend to be stupid, then you will become really stupid. If there is a problem on the front line, it will be a tragedy for him, the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether it will arouse the fear of the outside world, it has come to this point, how can we look forward and backward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running all the way on the horse road, when Hudson and his party arrived in the southeastern province, the call-up order from the royal capital had already arrived first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the war horse has the blood of a monster, it is still a creature that runs on the ground, not as fast as flying in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he had time to return to the territory, Hudson was stopped halfway by people from the Governor's Mansion, and was invited to attend the military meeting in Beda City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous crowding out, at this critical moment, the Viscount Sith, who was the representative of the northern nobles, also appeared in the conference room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'll just wait for you guys. Now that all the important personnel are in place, I won't waste any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must have heard about it. The Orc Empire has begun to mobilize, and the kingdom can only follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected by the Kingdom, the total force mobilized by the Orc Empire this time will exceed one million, and may even reach two million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the help of the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxie to share the pressure, this is still a life-and-death battle for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom must go all out, any negligence will bring a **** lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to His Majesty's call-up order, the southeastern province will mobilize 30,000 troops within a month and send them to the front line to reinforce the defense line in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone must know the list of the first batch of mobilized personnel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those young men are idle and have no place to release their energy all day long, so give them a chance to serve the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I calculated, in addition to these people, there is still a gap of 15,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap is not very big, so I am too lazy to subdivide it. Fifteen counties were present, with one thousand people from each county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The requirements are very simple and can be obtained. We can't send everyone to the front line. The reinforcements are there to guard the frontier, not to send heads to the orcs thousands of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to allocate specifically, you go back and discuss behind closed doors. Anyway, we must follow the rules, and if there is any trouble, we will be punished severely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom's rear, my southeastern province is behind in the mobilization sequence because we have always shouldered the heavy responsibility of the kingdom's granary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the outbreak of a full-scale war, I must arrange the follow-up work before I lead the army to go out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, every month we will supply the front lines with fifteen million pounds of rye, eight million pounds of potatoes, five million pounds...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific tasks will be implemented in each county, and then you will implement them in detail for each lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to play tricks, the Governor's Mansion will send people to supervise, and the Kingdom will also send a supervision team to spot check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who dares to do something on this will be punished as a rebellion of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 154": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 154: mobilization\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 154 Mobilization\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Out of people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Out of grain\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pay money\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's order can be summed up in three simple words. Even the specific amount has been clarified, which is obviously communicated in advance by the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a middle-class nobleman, he can only barely enter the center of power in the kingdom; there is still a long way to go from the real decision-making level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bosses have all discussed it, and this king's order is obviously not discussed with everyone. All of the above requirements must be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to specific details, the distribution of tasks among the counties within the province is bound to involve wrangling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, the situation in the southeastern province is good. As the kingdom's rear, the first task is to ensure the supply of money and food to the front line, and the second is to provide qualified soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thirty thousand soldiers are the best solution, and the unlucky nobles who were punished contributed half of the quota. The rest of the county only needs 1,000 people to distribute to each lord, and there is no pressure at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These soldiers are all to be added to the border guards. Throwing more than a hundred knights in, with fewer officers, it would not be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce did not mention a leader, so there is a high probability that some unlucky nobleman with good ability was cheated by his own son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of \"war tax\" is a little tricky. Generally speaking, it is also within the controllable range, anyway, it is right to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have the money to pay in kind, or send more people to fight the war, you can also coordinate within the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most troublesome thing is supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province needs to provide various strategic materials including food, which is as much as 15,000 tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a province, it seems that there is not much apportionment. But the crux of the problem is that everyone not only needs to raise supplies, but also organizes manpower to send things to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of other materials on the road is not large, and the loss of a few points is almost the same. But food is the only exception, but the southeastern province mainly provides food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is more than a thousand kilometers from the southeastern province to the front line. Although it can be transshipped along the coast or along the river for a certain distance, there is still more than 400 kilometers of human transportation required in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the most optimistic estimate. In many cases, it is not enough to transport the food to the nearest location, and it may change with the changes of the battlefield situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's mathematical ability is not bad, after a little calculation, he came to the conclusion that at least one-third of the loss was lost on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because the Alpha Kingdom has many combat experiences against orcs. The infrastructure along the way is relatively complete, and there are multiple granaries on the way that can be used as transfer stations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peacetime, one-third of the food was lost in transportation. After the war broke out, half of the food was lost in transportation. Hudson would not be surprised at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that the southeastern province is placed behind the mobilization sequence. Without their aristocratic lords hosting, how can materials be collected and transported to the front line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From Hudson's point of view, in the previous orc invasions, after the human coalition forces defeated the orc army, they quickly finished work and went home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not because the nations of the human race are not united, nor is it because the coalition forces are unable to fight back, but more because the material consumption on the battlefield is too terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting in the Alpha Kingdom itself consumes so much supplies. Once the battle line extends to the Orc Empire, even if one person fights and ten people transport food, it may not be able to meet the needs of the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, the human race will never learn from the orcs. The fact that the orcs were able to assemble a large number of troops was not because of their strong logistics capabilities. On the contrary, the logistics of the orc empire was even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to assemble millions of troops on the front line is entirely because there is no bottom line. There is not enough food in the army, and the same kind who died in battle are their rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the human army and the orcs fought to the end, not because everyone was so brave, but simply because they didn't want to be reduced to food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the task of dividing troops and taxes directly into county units is easy to solve, but supplies are troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the southeastern provinces are all fertile land, the specialties of each county are still different, and some counties don't even have some materials at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assigning tasks directly to the county as a unit, I am afraid that it will be difficult for everyone to complete in the future. It's better to discount all the materials, and everyone completes the material raising according to their own special products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the total amount can roughly match, even if there are discrepancies in details, the Kingdom will not say anything if they think about it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson first proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves vital interests, and he must fight for it at this time. Otherwise, after mechanically distributing a pile of material tasks, it will not be possible to get them together if you go back and make your head bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the sheriff is the Viscount Sith, and these problems should be a headache for him. But this guy hasn't said a word since he entered the conference room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's self-knowledge, knowing that I don't have the right to speak here, or because of dissatisfaction, Hudson simply smashed it to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sheriff is doing badly, but the task still needs to be completed. If there is a problem with the major issues involving front-line strategic materials, the nobles in the entire Wright County will be implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be executed for the crime of \"human rape\", but it is a high probability event to be sent to the battlefield in advance to serve the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gang of aristocratic children who committed crimes in front of them are role models. Hudson doesn't want to go to the front line with the hat of \"wearing crime and making meritorious service\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Viscount Hudson's proposal is very good and very practical. The task is still divided into counties, but the Governor's Mansion will come up with a conversion ratio, and everyone will take the supplies to make a half-fold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this war, His Majesty the King is too busy to sleep at night, so there is no need to alarm His Majesty for the problems that we can solve internally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If some materials are insufficient, the Governor's Office can also come forward to purchase. Taking into account the increased cost of procurement, an additional 5% of fire consumption will be charged for the materials used to replace them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to combat price gouging while taking advantage of the chaos, from now on, prices within the province must be guaranteed to be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who hoards and disturbs the market price will be killed without mercy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the materials shipped to the front line, any strategic materials on the list must be approved by the Governor's Office if they want to leave the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counties must cooperate closely, especially the counties on the border must strictly prevent the outflow of materials. Whoever has a problem on the site will be responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war will definitely not stop for a while. This means that we must be prepared to provide supplies to the front line for a long time, and we must pay close attention to the next food production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone should lead by example and take the lead in saving food and reducing unnecessary waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the people below to stop all the extravagance and pleasure, and tighten your belt to live a hard life. I don't want to see someone bankrupt the territory before the war is over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's words made Hudson's hanging heart drop. The materials can be deducted from each other, and the difficulties faced by the mountain leaders will suddenly disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five points of fire consumption, that is definitely a manifestation of noble conscience. It is impossible to make money. If the operation is not good, the governor's mansion will have to accompany him in for a sum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purchasing materials sounds very simple. Once the materials that can be purchased are scaled up, they cannot be purchased with just money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the price is suppressed, enough materials can be purchased, and the fee of 5% is not too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Earl Pierce is really contributing to the war, rather than dealing with it half-heartedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the earnest warning at the end, which is even more thought-provoking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience discovery?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or maybe it's simply pity for the lower class nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These questions, no one can answer. However, the tragic event of the bankruptcy of the nobles due to the war will happen in almost every large-scale war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once on the verge of bankruptcy, the bottom line of the nobles is also a straight line breakthrough, and the speed of decline is beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smarter nobles fool businessmen into taking advantage of them. Mortgage all the goods that can be mortgaged, and finally deny the account directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have no bottom line, even sell their sons and daughters directly. It's just that it's not their own children that are sold, but the children of serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most stupid thing is to borrow money from the great nobles, or even mortgage the territory to borrow money. Once the debt is overdue, the end will definitely not be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More aristocrats who were in financial trouble still went around looking for relatives and friends to borrow money. When it came time to go bankrupt, all the relatives and friends were involved in bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such a thing, everyone can only consider themselves unlucky. Even for the sake of his own reputation, he can't jump out and add insult to injury, he can only let the debt be postponed indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the major creditors in the southeastern province, Hudson felt a chill in the back of his head. Judging from the current situation, he is very likely to become one of the unlucky relatives and friends involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who owe Hudson's debts, without exception, are all nobles with poor economic conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, these guys with stable industrial income are high-quality customers. When wartime came, the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The income from the territory basically supports the front line. If the aristocrats who are not wealthy do not gain anything on the battlefield, it will be difficult to persist until after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he thought of dozens of debts that might be overdue, and the hundreds of thousands of gold coins that should have been obtained were about to go to waste, Hudson's good mood suddenly disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You have adapted so quickly, you are worthy of being a famous knight of the bow. Hudson, it seems that you are really born for war!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of the conference hall, Hudson felt a toothache when he heard Viscount Oran's emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Born for war\" is an absolute slur. He said that he was like a catastrophe, wherever he went, there was war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs invaded the Alpha Kingdom and lasted for hundreds of years. It will explode with or without him, it's not the butterfly effect of some traverser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that this guy in front of him was his father-in-law, someone who couldn't be offended, he would definitely not be polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Oran, my reputation is too high! Compared with you, I still have a long way to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I hadn't received the news in advance in the capital, and there were a few more days of buffering time, I'm afraid I would have been in a hurry at the meeting just now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daughter-in-law is not available, so I can't afford to offend my father-in-law. Especially in this time of war, everyone has to stick together to tide over the difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these old-fashioned families, the Koslow family only has a longer inheritance time, and is far behind in other aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson, Viscount Oran laughed and said, \"Okay, I won't tease you anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know you have a lot of doubts in your heart now, if you want to ask, just ask! If you miss this opportunity, the next time we meet will probably be on the battlefield. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being seen through his mind, Hudson didn't find it strange. As the second family in the southeast province, Viscount Oran was by no means as simple as it appeared on the surface, able to live a happy life under the pressure of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Lord Viscount, I have always had a doubt. The kingdom has launched a national mobilization so quickly, and the time is so tight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many internal troubles in our southeast province alone, and it is still relying on Governor Pierce to forcibly assign tasks to barely implement things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other provinces are estimated to be not much better, and the capital has to face more problems. How can so many provinces across the country coordinate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the reinforcements arrive at the front line, how can they be reorganized quickly to form combat effectiveness in the shortest possible time? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of feudal cold weapons, millions of troops must be mobilized to fight. The amount of engineering involved is beyond Hudson's imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the performance of the nobles of the kingdom, who didn't seem to be too smart, made him even more worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of any omissions in the organization, the mobilization of millions of troops will become a joke. Not only can it fail to strengthen the border strength, but it may collapse the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you think too much. No matter who is around, there is a moment when you want to destroy your neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few hundred years, they have encountered more than a dozen wars of extermination of the country, and they all have the ability to complete mobilization in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has been in decline for a long time. You grew up in a small noble family. Many things you see are not the truth of this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suppression of the Skull and Bones rebellion last time did not represent the true strength of our noble group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alphonse was purely an accident. If he hadn't been unlucky and happened to be away from the family's main force, the Skull and Bones would not be so easy to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has a standing army in the northern border, you should have heard of it. But this mysterious army rarely enlists minor nobles, don't you find it strange?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, including my Holliser family, some of the nobles with a little strength in the kingdom have served in this army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other words, this standing army is essentially controlled by a group of nobles in the kingdom. The difference is limited to the question of the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to guarding the frontier, this army also has another role to train the army for us, and train the younger generation by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why are we only recruiting soldiers now and not letting everyone lead the troops there? It is because our people are already on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the constant confrontation with the orcs, we not only accumulated combat experience, but also reserved a large number of grassroots officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These were all forced out by the Orc Empire. In order to survive better, we have to learn survival experience from war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not allowing the minor nobles to join is both their protection and their restriction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For ordinary people, sometimes knowing too much is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of limited resources, the accommodation space of the upper class is limited. The only benefit is that the people above are not enough to feed, so how can more latecomers join in the grabbing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, you're in luck. Just in time for the tense situation in northern Xinjiang and the imminent war, the kingdom needs fresh blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, even if the Dalton family helps you operate, it can only be an honorary viscount, not a fiefdom viscount. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson became enlightened. It's not that the entire noble group is useless, but that the small nobles at the bottom are deliberately blocked by the upper class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's normal to think about it. As a kingdom that has fought fiercely with orcs for hundreds of years, even if it stays at the same place in other aspects, it is absolutely impossible not to grow in war and military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mystery is solved, and the noble group is indeed making progress. It's just that the upper-middle-class nobles made progress, and the lower-class nobles were excluded from the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by class solidification. You can actually see one or two from the fact that the children of the nobles in the north are going south to grab the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are not enough for everyone to share. If you let the small nobles enter the army and accumulate a lot of military merits on the front line, but there is no place to settle them in the end, it will definitely cause dissatisfaction among these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of this, it is better to let them live in a daze from the beginning. After the war broke out, just follow the past and be cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of small nobles, war is the only chance to change the distribution of benefits and break the solidification of classes, but it is also the beginning of disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most people, what is lacking is not only the opportunity, but also the ability to grasp the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without systematic learning and without going through the test of the flames of war, the probability of having a super-strong ability to lead troops is really too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally an opportunity to change fate, but because of my own lack of ability. Most of the minor nobles can only play the role of their own cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, the ancestors of the Koslow family had a glorious past, and some military knowledge left behind is justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, self-study also exists. If other people fail to succeed, it is a matter of their own ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brain supplement from the outside world perfectly explained why he trained soldiers. As for the different methods of military training, it has been hundreds of years. Who knows what kind of military training the ancestors of the Koslow family used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gen Zhengmiaohong, a member of his own family with a clean background, happened to catch up with the moment when the war broke out. Hudson can achieve a class transition without affecting everyone's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A self-taught military genius who is always accompanied by luck. And also has an earth bear as a bodyguard, a guy with a full level of battlefield survivability, it is normal to be popular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Hudson was able to defeat many competitors and marry the Holliser family, which became logical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"value\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fill the hole\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Now that the war is about to break out, and the family members are still on the front line in northern Xinjiang, this emotion is further amplified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to appease the morale of the army, Sith also made a lot of efforts. Most of the soldiers have formed families here, with wives and children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking root, the nostalgia for the homeland is still firmly imprinted in everyone's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Viscount Sith himself, the time to look north has increased recently. Obviously, he still has nostalgia for his hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, are you giving up your tax right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun asked in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For county magistrates, the right to collect taxes is undoubtedly the most important power, which is equivalent to financial power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sheriff who has lost financial power will inevitably have a greatly reduced voice in the affairs of the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too late! The war is about to break out, and everything has to give way to the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strongest in Wright County is the mountain leader. Before that, I could use the rules of the game to fight against him, but now it's too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the cooperation of local nobles, it would be very difficult for us to raise enough strategic materials on time. When it comes to the safety of the front line, this kind of thing cannot be delayed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there was a war in Wright County first, and then a plague of locusts, and the economy has not yet recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many territories barely achieved a balance of income and expenditure, and were simply unable to provide enough supplies. It was not easy to complete the tasks assigned by the above as required.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't really kill people, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This hot potato can be thrown to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has relatives and friends everywhere, which turned out to be his biggest advantage, but now it has become his biggest disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing that the tax package task fell on him, not only would he not make any money, but he might have to pay a lot of supplies for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually, it's just a matter of selling favors. During the war, if any accident happens, these will become dead debts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the unwillingness between the brows, betraying his true inner thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Risk and benefit are always directly proportional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tucao is risky, and it is not a kind of self-comfort under the helplessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opponent lay flat, and Hudson, who became the winner of this round of power struggle, did not show the joy that the winner should have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the 1,000 soldiers who were assembled in the shortest time. Both the war tax and the task of raising materials have encountered obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an endless stream of people who come here every day to cry about poverty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have no friendship can be forcibly executed, but Hudson really can't do it with old relatives and old friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the side of the Governor's Mansion, Hudson has fought for it as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce did not deliberately make things difficult on this issue. The tasks undertaken by the nobles of Wyton and Wright counties were only 80% of those of nobles in other regions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the care was not enough, it was still taken care of. This kind of thing can't be perfect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kingdom missions are divided by province. If some counties produce less materials, other counties must produce more, and the total amount must be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the people in the hall who kept complaining, Hudson angrily reprimanded: \"Enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I invite you here today to discuss solutions, not to listen to your complaints.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against the invasion of orcs is the responsibility of everyone in the Alpha Kingdom. We raised supplies in the rear because someone was fighting for us in the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you think it is unfair, you can choose to sign up for the war. As long as you take the army to the front line, you don't need to worry about money and food!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all know the total amount of money and food that needs to be raised in Wright County. I think everyone knows whether the figures I allocated are fair and reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to hide by crying a few times. The assigned task is a dead order, and the quota must be made up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you fail to fulfill your noble duties, and your territory is taken back and your noble status is taken away, you will have no regrets at that time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crying children have milk, and that is at home. Outside, no one is obliged to accommodate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If making a fuss can solve the problem, then everyone ran to make a fuss, what should the front line do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, nobles from all over the world contributed money and effort. The only exception is the northern nobles, who only need to fight on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All is fair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This mobilization mode is because the noble private armies of various provinces participated in the war and adopted a rotation combat mode. After a period of time, they would come down to rest and replace them with others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a northern noble who is responsible for guarding the land, he does not have this kind of treatment. As long as the war breaks out, they can only keep fighting on the front line until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To defend their own land, the nobles of the Northland have already used all their strength to expand their armies and prepare for war. All of them are militaristic masters, and all the money and food in the territory are invested in the army, and there is no need for the kingdom to send people to urge them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, it's not that we don't want to fulfill our noble duties. But now the territory can't make ends meet, and we really can't afford the expense.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Handel said in frustration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the helpless expression on his face, it can be seen that this guy is really helpless, and he is ready to be completely messed up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it, you can't do it. Even if you are forced to go to the front line in advance, you still can't get enough money and food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially strategic materials, not only will be released now, but will be released every month in the future. And this number, there is a high probability that it will continue to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some impoverished nobles, it may not be difficult to gather supplies for a month or two, but the year-round consumption is really unbearable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Handel, I am also aware of your situation. Providing money and food for the front line for a long time does put a lot of pressure on you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But rules are rules, and you and I are not qualified to change this. The king's order must be fulfilled without compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County, the nobles facing the same predicament are not just one or two families. It can even be said that most nobles have certain difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all adults and have the ability to take responsibility for our own actions. No matter what decision you make, I respect your choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't want to spend money and food, just fill out the registration form, take the army to the front line with the food delivery team, and participate in the Kingdom Defense War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I would like to remind you: blocking the invasion of orcs is not as easy as suppressing the rebellion of skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of previous wars, the earlier you participate in the war, the lower the probability of coming back alive. Whether you want to take a risk or not, you should think it through before making a decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I personally suggest that you first raise materials as much as possible and complete the tasks explained above. In the end, there was really no other way, and I took the army to serve in the front-line army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money and food, after all, are belongings outside the body. Even if the family property is exhausted now, it can be accumulated again in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fate, but his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for some families with few heirs, once you die on the front line, the family property you have worked so hard to accumulate can only be cheaper for others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said earnestly and earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the gap is small, you can help advance the payment. But the current situation is obviously not right, and someone actually messed up as soon as they came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there is no other way but to follow the rules. Fighting the orcs is everyone's responsibility. If you have money, you will pay for it, if you have food, you will pay for it. If you have nothing, you will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere in the ceremony suddenly became tense. The nobles who originally wanted to win over suddenly realized that the reason they had prepared was so ridiculous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulties are indeed worthy of sympathy. But the problem is that everyone is in trouble now. It is difficult for the nobles who are responsible for raising supplies, and it is even more difficult for the nobles who are fighting on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, the supplies in our hands won't last long at all. We can't just let the people go hungry in order to complete the task!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wonder if you have any countermeasures that can help us tide over the difficulties? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sanchez asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a reminder, everyone realized that today's meeting is to discuss countermeasures and tide over difficulties together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the expectant eyes of everyone, Hudson shook his head directly, pretending to be helpless and said: \"So I only know that everyone has difficulties, but I didn't expect the difficulties to be so difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, it is extremely difficult for the mountain leaders to complete the task, and I have to find a way to fill the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous areas lack food, and among all kinds of strategic materials, only iron has a good output. According to regulations, one hundred and fifty thousand pounds of good iron needs to be provided every month to complete the task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you all know that even if calculated according to the prices in normal times, the value of so much good iron is more than 5,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, it is not surprising that the price doubles if it is sold outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of iron smelting has always been high. Even if the cost of ore and coal is not counted, the food and drink of thousands of miners is a huge expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't bear such a heavy financial burden. In order to reduce expenses, we can only undertake some forging tasks to reduce some expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the mountainous territory is special, and it is impossible for everyone to follow suit. But everyone can also develop some side jobs that can be completed according to their actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the lords along the river and along the river can catch some fish, and after being smoked and dried, one pound can be worth four pounds of rye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have the conditions, it would be even better to raise some fast-growing aquatic products yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Territory with plenty of prey, capture some prey, and use it to make up for it after it is dried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is wild vegetables in the field, they will be harvested after drying. You can also plant some fast-maturing crops according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County is only a hundred and eighty miles away from the sea. If you have a good network, you can get a boat and organize people to go fishing. It is also a way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If none of these can be done, then my mountainous region lacks labor, so blacksmiths, miners, farmers, shoemakers... can all come here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Employment price is calculated according to actual capacity. For specific details, you can send someone to discuss with the manager below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to do it specifically depends on your actual situation. Even if the materials raised are just a drop in the bucket, it is better than doing nothing. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is making dried fish, dried meat, or dried vegetables, it is a typical bad idea. It's not that there is a problem with the countermeasures, the key is that they are divorced from reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all well-developed cooked lands. The fish and shrimps in the river are often patronized by the residents along the coast; the beasts in the mountains and forests often appear on the dining table of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wild vegetables are also food. For serfs, wild vegetables can be regarded as half of the staple food. It is almost a must-have for meals, and it is not enough for home-cooked food. Where is there any excess, it is used to make dried vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out to sea to fish is even more nonsense. Even if there is a real connection to get the boat, it is not a reliable thing to let a group of landlubbers go fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the sea in the magical world is not flat. In the vast sea, there are countless dangerous creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fishermen have always been one of the highest-risk occupations. Being able to farm with peace of mind, almost no one wants to take the risk of going out to sea to fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real way to point out to everyone is to rent labor. Materials such as food and cloth cannot be grown in a day or two, but the output of the mine can be increased in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, iron was a hard commodity. Whether it is the raw iron produced or the forged weapons, they can be handed over to the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson added again: \"If all these are done, it still cannot meet the needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can also consider becoming mercenaries and completing military service for wealthy nobles in neighboring provinces in exchange for generous rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are many applicants, I can propose to the Governor's Office to stagger your military service time. To prevent you from being recruited by the province during your service.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also went to the battlefield, followed the provincial troops to the front line, and could come back to rest every once in a while. The security is far higher than entering the standing army and fighting until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the kingdom will not recruit nobles from our southeastern provinces to the front line on a large scale until the critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the provinces coordinate well, they can still be staggered. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is fooling people, but there is really such a need. Some aristocrats who are wealthy and happen to be in the infancy stage have the need to hire someone to serve on their behalf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mercenaries' fighting will is not high, and they are reluctant to perform the task of defending the city. Once lost in the field, it is easy to desert.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In principle, the kingdom prohibits this kind of behavior of hiring people to serve as soldiers, but legal principles are nothing more than human feelings, and there are always exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the last time the Skull and Bones Society rebelled, some of the heirs of the families in the two counties were still milk babies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't let people carry these doll lords to the battlefield, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such times, the officials in charge of the specific implementation will turn a blind eye, close one eye, and acquiesce in their use of mercenaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also risks in this. If the mercenary serving on his behalf has a problem, the employer must also be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, everyone likes to ask nobles to do it for them. They are all existences who know the basics, and the priest can't run away from the church if he can run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, there is another situation—obligation swap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, nobles in different provinces exchange their obligations. You go to my province to fulfill your obligations, and I go to your province to perform your obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only limited to nobles with comparable status and overall strength. And the approval of the governors of the two provinces is also required.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of situation mostly happens in big families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large families have many members, and it is normal for collateral descendants to be distributed in other provinces. During the war, if you don't feel at ease following others to the battlefield, you can exchange them back in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, as long as you apply, there will be no problems. Anyway, there are people to complete the tasks, everyone takes what they need, gives convenience to each other, and can also leave a favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of children in the big family varies, and the actual situation is also different. This kind of exchange cannot be just made up, and if there is a difference, compensation needs to be given.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be supplies, or people can be sent to serve in the past. The specific situation still depends on the actual coordination situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation is urgent, it is too late to coordinate. Then transfer the obligations directly. Simply put, these nobles enter another province to perform their obligations, and their obligations are directly transferred to the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After countless times of gameplay, everyone has a wealth of experience, and no one can take advantage of this aspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out by orcs. During the long years of war, the pressure of life and death forced the top leaders of the Alpha Kingdom to make continuous progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In response to various unexpected situations, corresponding countermeasures were formulated early on. For the little nobles below, it doesn't matter who they follow on the battlefield, what matters is the obligations that should be fulfilled, and none of them can be missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, if we send all the young and strong to work in the mountains, can military training also be carried out here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley asked bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles have difficulties, and the northern nobles are also not easy. Except for a few wealthy nobles, most of the northern nobles also cannot afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Kettler was ready to go to the battlefield, but now he suddenly found that he was still struggling, so naturally he had to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course! But it's limited to reserve forces, and daily basic military training will be carried out according to one exercise per ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are still responsible for the specific training, I only provide the venue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the busy farming season, you can also let the young and strong return to the territory to work. Prioritize food production in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't rush to be happy, you have to be mentally prepared. Mountain collars only employ surplus labor during the slack season, so the price will not be too high. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson deliberately glanced at Viscount Sith with a livid face. If it wasn't for this guy lying flat and throwing all the troubles at him, there would be no such opportunity to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this special period, it would be almost impossible to get the entire county's labor force to come and work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the lords can lower their faces and let their subordinates come to work, Hudson can't afford the wages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the market is affected by the relationship between supply and demand, blindly increasing production capacity will only lead to price collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only during the war period, when the demand for iron reaches its peak, can the production capacity be exploded regardless of everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the huge profits brought about by the explosive production capacity, the development cost of the territory will naturally come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously aware of Hudson's sinister intentions, but this is a naked conspiracy, and Viscount Sith can't do anything about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you say it, it can't stop everyone's enthusiasm for joining. From the moment he chose to lie flat, Wright County's dominance fell into the hands of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sabotage?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, it was suppressed by Sith himself. Increasing iron production is entirely in the interests of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the king's order, it was clearly proposed to increase iron production everywhere. In order to be able to forge more weapons and arm more troops to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Already at a disadvantage, jumping out to go against the general trend, maybe the last popularity among the nobles in the north will be tossed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the expressions of everyone, and then to the north, Viscount Sith slowly stood up and said with a smile:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Viscount Hudson's arrangement is already very reasonable. As long as the iron production in the Mountain Territory increases, everyone's material crisis will be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a shortage, everyone can borrow money! Our proud Viscount Hudson is not a stingy man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But everyone is engaged in production, and military training must not be neglected. Every time the orcs invaded in an all-round way, blood would flow into rivers in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only practiced once every ten days, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it weren't for his self-restraint, Hudson would have wanted to drive away directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially hearing the word \"borrowing\", Hudson almost choked to death. There are still a lot of bad debts outside that cannot be collected, and if new debts continue to be added, the mountain collar will definitely be dragged down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the misappropriation of project development funds for the swamp, the finances of the Mountain Territory would have gone bankrupt long ago. The embezzled funds will eventually have to be returned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least it cannot affect the development of the swamp project. Otherwise, if Bear Stearns discovered the problem, his reputation would go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is absolutely impossible to do things like exhausting the pond to fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No borrowing money, let alone borrowing materials. Including wages for hiring labor, they are all offset by iron products that have not yet been smelted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only do these have to be filled with iron products, Hudson even plans to retain some of the materials received from the nobles for his own use, and then fill the pit with iron products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at these nobles crying poor and crying, in fact, they still have some family background. It may not be able to bear the pressure of providing money and food for a long time, but it will definitely not go bankrupt in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows the simple truth of accumulating food in troubled times. If you don't force it, you will never know the real family background of these nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising money and food for the front line is not the first time it has happened. Similar events have happened dozens of times over the past few hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experienced nobles will save a sum of money and food every year as emergency funds. These are the family heritage, as long as there are no prodigal sons in the family, the accumulation of the ancestors is enough to tide over the difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for those families who suffered heavy losses in the Skull and Bones rebellion, other local nobles can turn to the family for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Increasing training time is even more nonsense. Military training is very energy-consuming, and it is impossible to meet the demand without eating meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is changed to exercise every three days according to Sith's proposal, the food expenses will almost consume their wages, and the noble gentlemen will not be busy in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No need for Hudson to speak, it was unanimously rejected by everyone. One exercise per ten days is enough to ensure basic training, and only a small number of soldiers need to be trained on weekdays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really reached the point where the whole people are recruited, and the Alpha Kingdom is also at the end of its rope. Sending a large number of serf soldiers to the battlefield is just delaying time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dissonant episode did not affect the final outcome of the meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the nobles in Wright County, renting out labor during the slack season can not only reduce the food consumption of the territory, but also get a salary to make up for the financial deficit of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a good thing that kills two birds with one stone, why refuse? As for whether Hudson earns more, that's not something they little people should worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one would make a foolish choice to offend their boss at this time. If you don't handle the relationship well now, it will be too late to cry on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to keep secrets among the nobles. The incident that happened in Wright County was quickly spread. Become a topic of conversation after dinner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter to the nobles in other regions, this is the first time to collect money and food, everyone's pockets can fully bear it, and there is not much pressure for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of Wyton County are different. As the unlucky second county group, everyone was harmed by the Skull and Bones together, suffered civil strife together, suffered locust disasters together, and now they are licking their wounds together to raise money and food for the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in Wrightshire can't bear the pressure, and the situation in Wrightshire is not much different. Seeing Hudson helping the younger brothers solve problems, everyone was envious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon the pressure spread to Viscount Kayo. Aristocrats kept coming to cry for poverty, and asked him, the boss, to find a way to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fu Bo, faced with this situation in the past, how did the county guards in various places solve it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't panic when you encounter something, learn from the experience of your predecessors first, and then it's not too late to make a decision slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few hundred years, almost all accidents that could have happened have happened. The successful coping plans of the predecessors are the best reference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, special circumstances like Wyton County have rarely happened in the past. It is really rare that all natural and man-made disasters come together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, even if there is a rebellion, the loss in the county will not be too great. It was the first time since the establishment of the Southeast Province that the rebels occupied the land of the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early stage of raising supplies, the noble lords below can support it. Only in the later stage will there be a lack of financial resources, and the county governor's office will need to lend them some money for emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most serious year was the outbreak of floods during the war. The counties in the southeastern province suffered heavy losses and were unable to undertake the important task of raising supplies for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, as a last resort, the family led the nobles from all over the country to purchase a batch of supplies from overseas to complete the mission of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it is now, the nobles have financial problems before the war has fully broken out. Generally, it will only appear on the nobles who are in the middle of nowhere, and everyone usually leaves it alone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decisive emergency response made the Dalton family stand out. So far, it has been talked about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering a loss, everyone has developed a good habit of storing grain. In particular, the Dalton family has established their own emergency supplies storage warehouse, which is basically full in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is preparing in advance, and those who do not prepare in advance, or who are not prepared enough, naturally become the targets of exclusion and criticism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who is a prodigal son, who only knows how to enjoy himself on weekdays, and does not know how to accumulate wealth in advance. It is also a matter of course to let it fend for itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But not now, this time the situation is special. Everyone is not in trouble because they are prodigal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Natural disasters and man-made disasters come together, and the family background of the little nobles is not strong, so they cannot withstand such a toss. The lack of money and food makes sense logically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of the aristocracy, apart from the naked and cruel reality, also has to talk about human feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, there are neighbors next door who actively deal with the contrast. If they are completely left alone, the younger brothers who can't bear the pressure may jump to work with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Viscount Sith is a foreigner, and it is reasonable to be ostracized. If he is evaded, the Dalton family's face will be pulled to the ground and rubbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was because of the scruples about the reaction of the Dalton family that Hudson's tentacles stayed in Wright County and did not reach out to Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can't stabilize the basic market by himself, and the younger brothers take the initiative to run over to seek refuge, that's another way of saying it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fu Bo, send a message to the family and borrow a few people who can train soldiers. Inform the nobles in the county and ask them to organize young men to come for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles who participated in the training camp and failed to complete the tasks stipulated by the kingdom, the county guard can lend money and food to them, and the interest is charged at a symbolic 10% per year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kayo said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, a loan with an annual interest rate of 10% is charity. Especially in this period of war full of uncertainty, it is the conscience of the nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to let everyone send the young and strong to the unified training, Viscount Cayo also spent a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all rolled out. Kayo, who doesn't want to keep falling behind Hudson and wants to make achievements, must win over the nobles in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just pulling people over is not enough. When it comes to the battlefield, what everyone fights is no longer political means, but the record of killing with one knife and one gun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo is self-aware and very clear that he will not be Hudson's opponent when it comes to fighting with troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because you can't use troops to fight a war doesn't mean you can't do well in battle. After all, the battle is all about strength. As long as you train a soldier that can fight, the situation will become completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting in the port, the Dalton family has no shortage of supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the Dalton family is concerned, it is nothing more than two extra trips for the fleet to advance supplies for the nobles in the county. These investments have to be returned anyway, and they won't just go to waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In exchange for a battle-worthy soldier, Kayo felt that he was not losing anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also a conspiracy. Perhaps other counties can learn from it, but Wright County cannot follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't devote your labor force to the development of the territory, and desperately expand the steel production capacity, Hudson will not be able to complete the tasks assigned by the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is far easier to achieve results with a well-trained army than with a mob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Young master, all the young and strong in the county are gathered here, even if the food and grass are shared by everyone, the training venue required is not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountains have a large number of undeveloped hills, except for a few trees, there are only shrubs and weeds. If you use it as a training ground, you will naturally not feel distressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luoye Town is all cultivated land. If a large area is designated as a training ground, it will definitely affect the food production of the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old housekeeper reminded cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Wyton County is slightly smaller than Wright County, the number of young and strong people owned by the nobles is not a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training ground of tens of thousands of horses is not what the small military camp in Luoye Town can accommodate, and it will inevitably occupy a lot of farmland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, follow my instructions. It's just temporarily occupying some farmland, which is nothing compared to the possible gains on the battlefield.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Have made a decision, he will not regret it. Having a combatable soldier can not only increase his survival rate on the battlefield, but also greatly improve his future status in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they cooperate well with the family, maybe the Dalton family can take a small step forward this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although in essence, Gong, Hou, and Bo are all vassals of one party, they have almost the same power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A powerful feudal earl has even more power to speak than some declining dukes. But in terms of address, he was still a little short.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kayo doesn't care about the small problem of title. But he is still very interested in strengthening the family's strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enough military achievements + strong strength, and coincidentally catching up with the good time of the big reshuffle, no matter how you look at it, it is a good opportunity to take a step forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't just Viscount Cayo who rolled up crazily. The counties in the southeastern provinces, or the nobles in the kingdom who can participate in the game, are desperately expanding their force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is only a few young optimists who want to seize the fruits of post-war victory. Older nobles don't have so many fantasies, and strengthening their military strength is entirely for self-protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win the war against the orcs, you will have a future; if you lose this battle of national destiny, the fate waiting for them is the ruin of the country and family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bigger the person is, the more he knows how powerful the Orc Empire is. Confidence in this war has also become less and less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no choice, it is estimated that there is no big force in the Alpha Kingdom that wants to fight the orc army to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the neighbors explode, Hudson's hanging heart slowly fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be afraid of the enemy being strong, but your teammates will be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the teammates are actively preparing for the battle, and they didn't slack off just because the call-up order came to him. This is definitely a good thing for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all grasshoppers on the same rope. The stronger the teammates, the greater the probability that the kingdom will win this war. If it is impossible to win, it can delay time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't blindly join the wave of crazy military training, the mountain territory is still operating in an orderly manner. Hudson is not afraid of being criticized for inaction, and increasing military production capacity is also contributing to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First set a small goal, increase the raw iron production capacity of the territory to 500 tons/month within three months, and increase the production capacity to 1,000 tons/month within half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the level of the small workshop iron factory in the previous life is not even high, this number is already one of the best in the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in many small countries, all the steel production capacity combined cannot reach this figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, you will arrange the production of the mine yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These employees can be arranged to mine or forged in the later stage, but the most critical smelting link can only be controlled by our people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smelter should be strictly guarded, and all outsiders are prohibited from approaching. If you find suspicious persons, arrest them first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hiding the truth for a while is a temporary thing. Hudson doesn't want to spread his own blast furnace ironmaking technology all over the world so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traditional smelting mode, one hundred and eighty pounds of iron can be produced, and two to three hundred pounds can be produced, all of which are master craftsmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keshan has the largest blast furnace, but it can produce more than one ton of iron in one furnace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the production capacity high, but the quality of the raw iron produced is also better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not comparable to the legendary magical iron-making furnace, the production cost of the two is not at the same level. One uses magic spar as energy, and the other uses charcoal and coal, which are simply incomparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, other secrets in the territory, even if they were placed in front of the serfs, probably would not attract their attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Marsh brand chemical fertilizer is no longer used in the busy farming season, but is spread in the ground while reclaiming wasteland in the name of increasing the soil thickness of the newly reclaimed wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all in the same county, which is equivalent to working at the door of the house. During the busy farming season, everyone has to go back to their respective homes, and they have no chance to get in touch with the agricultural production in the mountainous area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, it is also a designated area to work, and it is difficult for foreign serfs and local serfs to have close contact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, everyone is not familiar with it. Saying hello is considered warm, and I'm afraid I won't say a word more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, the production in the mining area is well arranged. The biggest trouble in the territory now is the rapid increase in food consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of mouths increased by tens of thousands all of a sudden. We originally had a relatively rich reserve of grain, but now we are afraid that we can barely support it until the spring grain is put into storage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, the food produced in the territory from next year can meet 80% of the consumption, and only a small amount is enough to fill the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has changed, and the food gap has not decreased but increased. That's all in normal times, as long as you have money, you can always buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, unless you personally come forward, sir, even if we can pay a high price, we may not be able to purchase enough grain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Since becoming a lord, he has been worrying about the lack of food every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to solve the food problem, Hudson carried out land reclamation at any cost. Because of the large-scale land reclamation, the food crisis in the territory was exacerbated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food production capacity of the mountainous areas keeps hitting new highs every year; the food shortage of the mountainous areas also hits new highs every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was as if he took the wrong script and fell into a vicious circle of \"the more food is lacking, the more land will be opened up, and the more land will be opened up, the more food will be lacking\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The solution is very simple, slow down the development of the territory, reduce the number of employees, and dispose of the redundant slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no tiankeng for land reclamation, food consumption has dropped, and the mountain leaders can immediately reverse the dilemma of not being able to make ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The first batch of supplies raised by the county will be in place soon. Keep all the food in it and replace it with iron bumps to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient inventory, use some well-forged weapons to make up for it.

The growth rate of the eating mouth is much higher than the growth rate of the territory's food production capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly increased tens of thousands of mouths, the pressure on the nobles in the county was reduced, but the pressure on the mountain leaders suddenly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the production capacity of mines in the early stage has not yet exploded, and the expenditure of the territory is much higher than the income, the pressure is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a conscientious aristocratic lord, Hudson can't do anything that is shoddy and harms the frontline army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a grasshopper on the same rope. In essence, the core of the Alpha Kingdom's defense against the orc invasion is the drag word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is time to counterattack until the countries of the human race react and the reinforcements from the mainland countries arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, whether it was defending the city or taking the initiative to attack, it was all to slow down the attack speed of the orc army and buy time for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The longer the frontline troops stand on top, the later Hudson will be called up, the more time he will have to prepare, and the greater the probability of surviving on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This account is easy to calculate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, even if you want to shoddy, it's hard to get away with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The governor's office will check, the kingdom's officials will check, and the front-line generals will still check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any problem found in any link will be found out and held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules, every qualified weapon is engraved on it. The place of origin, the craftsman in charge of casting, the time of casting, and the person in charge of supervising the manufacturing are all available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To trace it, just follow the information marked on the weapon and trace back to the source.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also a sign for the mountainous territory to distinguish good weapons from bad ones. In order to quickly make money to produce low-quality goods, reducing production costs is the top priority, and the lettering process is naturally omitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as a red glow appeared on the horizon, Crown Prince Alex appeared in front of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The warriors of the Orc Empire, thousands of years ago, the human race betrayed their trust and colluded with all the races in the mainland to seize our territory and kill our people by despicable means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great orc clan was driven from the center of the fertile continent to the desolate frontier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred in it is higher than the mountain and deeper than the sea!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But evil human beings not only don't know how to repent their sins. Instead, they intensified and sent slave hunting teams, causing disasters in all directions in our orc empire, making all tribes miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using this despicable method, he tried to force the descendants of the great beast gods to submit and serve them as slaves and handmaids forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Beast God people, how could they succumb to these despicable guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shame can only be washed away with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's time for revenge, warriors take up your weapons...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On January 11, 99988 in the sacred calendar, Crown Prince Alex launched the \"Declaration of Revenge\" in the army, which opened the prelude to the 136th Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the end of the speech, the army of the Beamon Royal Court took the lead in attacking the Alpha Kingdom. Almost at the same time, the other four imperial courts also started a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom, Moxie Principality, and Alpha Kingdom, three unlucky guys, ushered in the invasion of the orc army together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of shouting and killing continued to resound in every corner of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people in the north who had long been experienced fled into the fortresses in various places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic lords of the aristocrats also put down their bodies at this moment, and walked up to the city wall to command the army to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The beacon smoke on the beacon tower went straight into the sky, rising one after another like a relay pillar, spreading from the north to the king's capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, looking at the rising smoke, Caesar III secretly sighed: \"It's finally here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but when the war really broke out, his anxiety disappeared all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sense of fighting spirit suddenly rose from his chest, without stopping at all, Caesar III walked directly towards the meeting hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the Alpha Kingdom needs a king. The war broke out, and there were still thousands of troublesome things waiting for him to deal with, and Caesar III could not tolerate the slightest fatigue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How about it, have you determined the main attack direction of the orc army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the invasion of the orc army, the Alpha Kingdom, which had been prepared for a long time, had formulated several sets of countermeasures in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    is only the core of the implementation of these plans, and the enemy's attack direction must be determined first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, according to the investigation of the Griffin Cavalry, the number of orcs is too large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a full-scale attack from the beginning, and there is no clear main attack direction for the time being, as if it is testing the loopholes in our defense line! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero replied boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Ministry of Military Affairs is not strong enough to detect the movement of the orc army in advance, it's because the enemy is too ferocious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the clear organizational system of the human army, the army of the orc empire is still a traditional tribal and racial model. In terms of control over the army, it is obviously not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the orcs didn't try to change this situation. It's just that the fighting power after mixing different races is too touching, and there are often internal strife, and they have to retreat in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest feature of an army based on tribes is chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different orc races have very different combat powers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to come up with an accurate answer simply by judging the main attack direction of the orc army based on the number of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the fighting strength of 100,000 pigs is not as good as that of 10,000 wild boars, and the gap is even bigger compared to the Mobi army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real main direction of attack is not necessarily the one with the most troops, but it must be the one with the most elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the order of the orc army's invasion is usually the cannon fodder first, and the elite are responsible for supervising the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there are clear signs showing the direction of the main attack, it is almost time for the main attack to start. It is almost impossible to lay out traps in advance and wait for them to take the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Execute the original plan. Let the provinces mobilize in an orderly manner according to the previous plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the several provinces in the rear area, the supply of the kingdom's strategic materials must be ensured without any omissions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the countries of the Terran race, telling them that a new continental war is coming. Now we need support, all-round support in manpower, material and financial resources!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, I would like to remind Warhammer Kingdom and Moshi Principality to keep more reserves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar solutions, the royal library is almost full of a room, all of which are the valuable experience left by the ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old opponent, Alpha Kingdom's research on orcs is not a day or two, and they know each other relatively well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the other two neighbors are different. Although I have been entangled with orcs for decades, this is the first time I have encountered total war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of sufficient response experience, neither the preparation of the combat plan nor the mobilization system is as sound as the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As allies, the three countries are now in the same trench. To be torn open by the orc army in any direction is a challenge to the entire defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inconvenient for the Alpha Kingdom to intervene in the internal affairs of the allies. All Caesar III can do is remind them to keep more reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case there is a problem with a certain section of the defense line, it can be filled in time to plug the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the orcs started the war a month earlier than we expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization speed of the provinces is actually lagging behind. Although the first batch of reinforcements has already set off, it will take some time before they arrive at the front line for training and adaptation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the preparations for the orcs were also not very sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some orc tribes in remote areas are still on the way. In a short period of time, the strength of the orcs is not sufficient, and the pressure on the front line should not be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is the strategic materials. I am afraid that the provinces have not collected them at the moment, and they can only consume the front-line reserves in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The material reserves on the front line are still sufficient, enough to support the army for a year. In some important military fortresses, the materials stored are enough to support the defenders for three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five standing lines of defense have all been repaired to ensure that there will be no major omissions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following up the line of defense, lords from all over the country are also organizing manpower to repair it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the kingdom's preparations for the war were all normal, and there were no major disturbances. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland reported calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the war broke out, the work pressure on him, the prime minister, increased instantly. Fortunately, the people below knew the seriousness and did not make trouble at this point in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the aristocratic lords in the north, who were originally the most unstable elements in the kingdom, are now all active in preparing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for an order from the kingdom, and everyone spontaneously organizes manpower to repair the fortifications in their own territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The perennial war has turned the northern provinces of the kingdom into a war machine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, the Alpha Kingdom has built fortresses in the northern border every year. There are more and more lines of defense being built.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fief lords in the north are not idle either. In the slack season, in addition to organizing serfs for military training, they also brought people to maintain and strengthen the castle fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they don't care about national defense and security, but they are extremely concerned about the security of their own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of survival, the subsidy issued by the kingdom miraculously fell into practice under the feudal bureaucratic system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ancient enfeoffment system exudes the most dazzling charm in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Caesar III couldn't help but mocked: \"I'm afraid it's not that the orcs want to attack in advance, but they have to attack. With their poor logistical capabilities, it is simply a dream to support a million troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the attack is not launched in advance, I am afraid that they will fight among themselves before the army is assembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anxious to launch an attack, most likely the gang of beasts wanted to eat meat, and they focused on the corpse of their companions! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"beast\" comes first, and the \"man\" comes after.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a mixed breed, orcs naturally inherit the wildness that belongs to beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driven by the instinct of the weak to prey on the strong, the internal struggle of the orcs has always been fierce. The winner has it all, the loser is the food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the five royal families deliberately suppressed it, they couldn't change this barbaric side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every once in a while, the vassal races are invaded south. Whether the results of the battle can be achieved is second, and the key is to consume the unstable elements in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some particularly fertile races are feared by the five royal families and become the main consumables in every war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, the news of the outbreak of the frontline war came, and the urging documents from the Governor's Office followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who was under great pressure, also had to urge the lords below to speed up the speed of material raising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to raising supplies, it is actually more difficult to send things to the front line. According to the plan, the southeast province will send tens of thousands of tons of materials to the front line every month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Massive transportation tasks are obviously not something that a team of cavalry can complete. Each county can only organize its own team to transport supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The role of the Governor's Mansion is to coordinate and supervise. When it comes to the specific implementation, the noble lords below are responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County was lucky, Hudson replaced a large amount of grain with iron products to hand in the task. It is also a transportation task, and delivering iron is obviously easier than delivering food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One pound of iron can be exchanged for twenty-five pounds of miscellaneous grains. Not to mention the shrinkage in volume and weight at the same time, there is no need to worry about loss during transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was an accident on the way, and it was exposed to wind, sun, and rain, at most it would only add a layer of rust, just scrape it off before handing in the task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced with grain, several cars might be scrapped because of mold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, when transporting materials such as grain and salt, it is necessary to prepare more for losses during transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadeer City, looking at the piles of supplies, Hudson directly took the lead:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, the materials for this month have been prepared, and the next step is to transport things to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I won't talk nonsense, for the sake of fairness, everyone will come directly to draw lots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These wooden signs are numbered, and the three people who draw No. 1 will be responsible for the first transportation task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three people who draw No. 2 will be responsible for the transportation task of the next month, and so on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is left to God to decide. If you are unlucky and get the lottery with the previous serial number, consider yourself unlucky!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to change it, you can, but it must be voluntary. Any despicable means are not allowed here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lottery starts now, may the Lord of Dawn bless you all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a decision, not a negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He came up with the plan directly, without consulting everyone's opinions. Hudson's sudden role change made many people uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of political savvy knows that this is a test made in advance for the next reorganization of the army and issuing orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncomfortable is uncomfortable, and if you want to object, you still have no way to start. The drawing of lots determines the order of the escorted materials, which does seem fair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To veto this proposal, not to mention offending people, the key is that it is difficult to come up with a better way to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'll come first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that his dissatisfaction with Hudson has become more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For such a big matter, he didn't even say hello to him, obviously ignoring him as the sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But all of this, Hudson is still holding high the banner of righteousness against the orcs. No matter how dissatisfied he was, he could only hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No. 1 lottery!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are unlucky and drink cold water and their teeth are stuck. Sith never thought that his luck would be so good, and he would draw the worst lottery as soon as he came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that everyone has to perform transportation tasks, but the order is actually not important. But in fact, according to the serial number, it turns around, and the difference between one month and three years is three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The occupation of northern Xinjiang was indeed protracted, but most of the time it only came to an end in two or three years. If you can stop and go in the middle, if you can drag it for three or four years, it is considered resilient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With any luck, the war will end within two years. Nobles with lower serial numbers don't even have to undertake a transportation mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky, it will take exactly three years to end. Then the No. 1 lottery will win the first prize and need to undertake two transportation tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of everyone, Viscount Sith was too embarrassed to go back on his word, so he could only grit his teeth and admit his bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, it's your turn!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the bucket that Sith reluctantly handed over, Hudson smiled slightly and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are welcome, Viscount Sith. I proposed the lottery. For the sake of fairness, everyone will draw first. The last one left will be mine!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a show, although he is not a professional, he has seen a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's all about luck. When you can show your demeanor, there is no need to be the first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of being the first to take the risk and bet on your own luck, it is better to stay quietly and gamble that there are enough unlucky people in the crowd to take away the wooden sign with the serial number in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson looks down on people, it's really the group of sad nobles in Wright County, no matter how they look at it, few of them are lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, he caught up with the rebels, the nobles' internal strife, the locust plague, and the full-scale invasion of orcs. In just two or three years, his life experience is richer than that of other people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a miracle that this kind of extreme luck can survive until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no way, Hudson doesn't want to be mixed with these unlucky teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith is a good negative teaching material. How bad my luck is, I don't have any clues in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be the first to jump out of the lottery, it is not surprising to get the first prize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's fine if they are not capable, but their personal performance is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Lord of Dawn is always on the opposite side of them. No matter how perfect their plans are, they will eventually fail due to various accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fortune is not good, and the hero can only do nothing. So far, it has evolved to the point where the more you do, the more mistakes you make.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't come out and draw a lottery, it's all \"special prize\" treatment. Among the hundred or so wooden sticks, he got the two worst ones accurately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know this result, I don't know if the two will come to draw lots too early. After all, there are many unlucky nobles in Wright County, and they might be taken away by others later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is as Hudson expected, there are a bunch of unlucky people in front, and the rest will not be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky ones snatched up all the junk numbers, and chose one of the last two remaining lottery numbers, but they were still left with a tail number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this luck, Hudson would have doubted that he was a \"son of luck\" if he hadn't engaged in a black box operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The character design cannot be lost. For a good character design, it is reasonable to arrange it deliberately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly normal wooden sign is actually slightly different. Just because outsiders can't see it doesn't mean that our own people can't see it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone deliberately cooperated, and the last remaining wooden stick, regardless of the number engraved on it, the final answer announced will only be the tail number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The process is not important, what matters is the result. In the eyes of the nobles, Hudson missed the best number by luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nations of the human race responded faster and the war lasted a little shorter, he might not even be able to deliver the mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is his turn to deliver supplies, it will be in the middle and late stages of the war, and it is entirely possible to collide with the king's call-up order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two major obligations that need to be fulfilled are rushing together, so it is natural to give priority to the battlefield. The task of transporting supplies will naturally be taken over by other unconscripted nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculate the distance and you will know that it will take a month or two to transport materials back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is still no credit at all. Naturally, no one likes the drudgery of purely obligatory performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should be delivered on time. If an accident occurs midway, resulting in a delay in the arrival of the materials, or a direct loss, the kingdom will be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of being held accountable is not high. In order to avoid delaying the date, everyone will set off early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an accident, it must be a loophole in the defense line, and the orc army rushed in. If they come across it, the **** team will almost die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The result came out, regardless of luck or bad luck, it was all drawn out by you yourself, and you can't blame others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next task of delivering supplies will be performed according to the result of the lottery. I hope everyone can work together on the way to **** the supplies, and don't make troubles that will embarrass everyone and follow along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, there is a second major event today, which requires everyone to make a decision here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has broken out, and those who are willing to go out with me can come and sign up. Those who do not want to perform military obligations in the county and want to transfer to other regions must also make a statistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what choice you make now, the materials provided to the frontline every month are indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are nobles who exchange their obligations, or perform their obligations on behalf of others, or change the place of obligation performance for other reasons, they should go to the Governor's Mansion to apply for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remind you, if you want to apply for it, you'd better hurry up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has broken out, and some provinces have begun to mobilize, preparing to reinforce the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the obligation is transferred, it is necessary to catch up with others' speed of action. If you act slowly, you will be held accountable if you miss the deadline. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson's voice fell, everyone started talking. The Viscount Sith, who sat at the top, was so angry that he almost burst into flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To take the place out of the ordinary, for this sake, there are not many of them. As the sheriff of the host country, he has become an outsider now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an unbelievable scene happened in front of everyone's eyes, and everyone took it for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the northern nobles who originally supported him were dumbfounded at the moment, and joined the heated discussion team in twos and threes. Those who didn't know thought they were members of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the two groups of nobles living in harmony, Viscount Sith doubted his own eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, I was still yelling and shouting, but I changed my attitude so quickly, and the speed of changing my position is too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the world is too magical, but that the world is too realistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles are realists. The flames of war in northern Xinjiang have ignited. In the face of survival, the original small internal conflicts have been reduced to secondary conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of facing the orcs, everyone's position is the same. The need for common interests has temporarily suppressed internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone couldn't let go of their hatred in their hearts, and secretly planned to find a chance to get revenge, it didn't prevent everyone from expressing their goodwill to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were 105 people present, and 94 nobles signed up to join the Hudson team. Especially among the nobles of the north, except for Viscount Sith, who did not express their views, the rest actually signed up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foot of the wall was dug to such an extent that Hudson was taken aback. Obviously he didn't do anything, but only hinted a few times, so many people turned to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking in another place, and after weighing the pros and cons, he understood the reasons why the children of the northern nobles made their choices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go back to your hometown to join the war, now you can pack your bags and set off, and then carry them until the end of the war. Properly high-risk, low-return, failure will be taken by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Viscount Sith, who is most suitable to be a leader, was so suppressed by Hudson that he couldn't think about it for a while, and put it badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, playing like this is nothing. How can everyone feel at ease to entrust their wealth and lives to the past with such a poor performance at such a critical point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, everyone can only follow Hudson. At least Hudson has a good reputation and is particularly capable of playing, so he is lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following such a boss may not be able to make great achievements, but the probability of surviving on the battlefield must be higher than following other people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the results of the lottery, you can tell that a guy possessed by a bad luck spirit was the first to reach out and took away the saddest No. 1; the other stayed put and waited for everyone to draw first, and the rest were the best tail numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sharp contrast, even if Hudson said it was a coincidence, no one would believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If on the battlefield, Viscount Sith continues to maintain this kind of tragic luck, the men who follow him will be led into the pit sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield of the two major races, not to mention the soldiers of a county, even the soldiers of a province are wiped out, which is not uncommon in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it came to their own lives, all the nobles in the North didn't care about which camp or not, and chose the team that they thought was the safest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The statistical results have come out. The path is chosen by everyone. No matter what happens in the future, I hope you will not regret it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who are willing to stay in the county to participate in the war will be included in the unified training command. If you can't follow orders, you can still choose to quit if you regret it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will truthfully report your wishes to the Governor's Office for the choices of the rest of the people, and wait for the coordination from above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few inside the province don't need trouble. I have communicated with the other county guards, just transfer military obligations, and you can contact your hometown directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, there is also the Sith Viscount who has not yet made a decision. Are you going to fight alone, or are you going to return to the command of the Grand Duke of Kavadia? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't his deliberate connotation. It was actually Sith, the sheriff, who had now become the biggest unstable element in Wright County. It is necessary to suppress its arrogance and weaken its reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps out of conscience, Hudson also deliberately reminded everyone that they can still choose to quit now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, a bluff like \"Son of Luck\" can be used to deceive others. If I foolishly follow the letter, then my brain is flooded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without super good luck, Hudson has no idea where this team will eventually lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is certain is: in case of bad luck and a big defeat on the battlefield, he will never take care of his allies when he slips away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, you have misunderstood. As the Sheriff of Wright County, how can I ignore everyone at this critical moment and leave alone?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the anger was directed at Hudson; the other half was directed at the former gang of younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden betrayal of the northern nobles bankrupted all the plans of Viscount Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no going back to the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an embarrassing illegitimate child, he was the son of the Grand Duke when he stayed outside. After returning to the family, compared with those half-brothers, he became an unrecognizable person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current soldiers and horses in his hands, going to the battlefield alone to face the orc army is almost offering his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both roads have been gambled to death, and the other nobles have no friendship. Leaning over rashly, there is no place to appeal for grievances after being cheated to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, staying in the Wright County team, continuing to spend with Hudson, looking for new opportunities, the safety factor is the highest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Felix family is still at its peak, and his grand duke father is still in power, everyone will not dare to let him have any accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Craft candy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is Hudson's first reaction. Although the means were a bit shameless, Viscount Sith's choice really made him uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to refuse, you must also consider the reactions of the children of the northern nobles. Although the strength in the hands of these people has been weakened, they still have the ability to fight with soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the origin of the family, they are all feudal nobles who were killed with a knife and a gun on the battlefield. When it comes to military talent, it definitely beats most of the local aristocrats Jiutiaojie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, they were enemies. The more talented these people are, the more they must be suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation has changed. Everyone is going to fight the orcs. Not only will Hudson not be afraid of their talents, but he has to worry that they are not enough to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal grievances, everything will be discussed after the war is over. Judging from the extremely high casualty rates of previous wars, there may be conflicting opponents who died directly on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Viscount Sith is willing to stay, so we welcome it. However, efficiency is what matters on the battlefield, and there can only be one person who gives orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the country is facing a crisis, Hudson happens to have some military talent and is willing to take on this important task to serve the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This requires you to feel wronged and obey the military orders. Don't do anything that is detrimental to the interests of our human race because of a momentary dispute. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it is time to fight, we must fight. In the continent of Aslant, the strong are respected, and modesty is never considered a virtue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to play the trick of \"three pushes and three words\", the younger brothers don't know how to cooperate. Do as the Romans do, involving military power, Hudson can only show domineering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting off the big hat, he glanced at the audience, but couldn't find any supporters. Viscount Sith felt a chill in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While secretly scolding the children of the nobles in the North for being cowardly and unbelievable; at the same time secretly annoyed that they were careless, and they didn't even notice that they were dug into the wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he didn't know that all the nobles in the north made a temporary decision to quit because they saw that he was not strong enough, otherwise they would have to collapse on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, don't worry. How dare Sith be negligent in the slightest when it comes to matters involving hundreds of millions of people in our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm just afraid that someone will take revenge for their own sake and take the opportunity to suppress dissidents, wasting the vitality of my human race in vain, and making it easier for foreign bandits...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The struggle to death, except for giving Hudson another wave of eye drops, did not affect his acquisition of army command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson secretly raised his vigilance against the Sith Viscount. \"Bending and stretching\" is easy to say, but few can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to lower your figure and bow your head to competitors who are not as good as yourself is not a kind of ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly futile performance is not completely meaningless. At the very least, a seed of distrust has been planted in the hearts of all the noble children of the Northlands. If one day Hudson acts unfairly, this seed will take root and germinate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked in the direction of the person coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hanging around on the pier, I have seen a lot of people of all kinds who travel all over the world, and they can be called well-informed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it was the first time for many people to encounter the governor in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vast sea is extremely dangerous and always awe-inspiring. Storms, sea monsters, pirates...all threaten the safety of sea navigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Living at sea can be said to be a different kind of licking blood. You must be ready to die in the sea at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human beings are always full of fear of the unknown, and the aristocratic lord is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the southeastern province to Canglan City, the capital of the kingdom, in addition to the land transportation line, you can also sail along the mainland by sea, and then go upstream via the Lancang River.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sea line of communication has been in operation for hundreds of years, and countless ships and business travelers come and go every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bustling commerce and trade still cannot conceal the dangers of sea navigation. Almost every once in a while, there will be news of ship accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The danger of the sea cannot stop everyone from getting rich. The huge profits of maritime trade attract business travelers and adventurers to join in one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even some descendants of declining nobles have devoted themselves to the maritime trade business. Compared with the conservative and traditional inland, the atmosphere of Hansen Port is obviously much more open.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, among these participants, owners with big families and big businesses are not included.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the feudal lords, it is a last resort. Everyone would rather run wildly on land than go by sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, I hate unknown risks, and on the other hand, the experience of sailing at sea these days is really not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest advantage of sea freight is the low freight cost, as for passenger transport, it does not exist. The speed of galloping horses of noble gentlemen is much faster than that of slow ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A warhorse with the blood of a monster can be regarded as the greatest breakthrough in biotechnology in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The double improvement of endurance and explosive power freed the knights from the trouble of one person with two horses and three horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knights can easily travel hundreds of miles a day, and the military reports on the front line are expedited, and they can even travel thousands of miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, everyone still prefers to let the air units flying in the sky pass information instead of sending messages quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that air units are too scarce to be equipped on a large scale. Most of the time, cavalry is still used for communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the risk-averse conservative style of the aristocrats, if there is a choice, everyone is definitely more willing to go by land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the monthly freight task of tens of thousands of tons is too heavy. In order to reduce costs and improve efficiency, waterway transshipment has become the only option.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first time since the war broke out, the southeast province sent supplies to the front line. In order to show its importance, Governor Pierce brought a group of bigwigs in the province to personally supervise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the piles of supplies waiting to be shipped, everyone couldn't help but feel emotional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the list of supplies sent by his subordinates, Earl Pierce suddenly changed his face, pointing to a piece of data and asked in doubt: \"What's going on with the data on it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military officer on the side glanced at the data, and explained with a smile:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These materials were sent by Wright County. They were seriously affected by the disaster and did not raise enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the requirements of the provincial government, weapons, armor and high-quality raw iron were used to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally they wanted to take other iron products, but we refused them because of transportation considerations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We didn't expect that they would come up with so many iron products, and the province's internal materials could not be adjusted for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After communicating with the logistics department of the capital, they agreed to receive this batch of supplies, so...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Entering the nationwide mobilization system all at once, no matter how experienced you are, various problems will inevitably arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flexible adaptability is the key to solving problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time is too tight, and if a certain material is not in place, there is no way to offset it with other strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the rules are applied mechanically without leaving any room for flexibility, the people below will not be able to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce is naturally aware of this kind of thing. Otherwise, they would not have agreed to carry out material transfers in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what he cares about is obviously not the difference in the types of materials, but the quantity of high-quality raw iron that Wright County has produced, which far exceeds his estimation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original task of paying food has just turned into a pile of iron bumps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that the mountainous territory that could only produce low-quality weapons now has the basis for mass production of weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking to a carriage transporting weapons, he pulled out a warhammer from it, with the words Made in the Mountain Territory impressively engraved on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inferior low-quality iron has become high-quality iron. Earl Pierce can't wait to send the guys who collected information back to the furnace for remaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military production capacity is crucial to any major power. We must know that due to the lack of coal, the Dalton family cannot mass-produce weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of core strategic material has always been under his nose, and it has not been discovered for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War has broken out, and unity is the theme of Alpha Kingdom. Any behavior that causes disputes and undermines the overall situation of unity will be severely cracked down by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the current mountain collar is not a soft persimmon. Hudson, who has integrated the military forces of Wright County, can also be regarded as a powerful faction in the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    proposed to exchange fiefs, and it was difficult for the Dalton family to take advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A burst of hearty laughter covered up the unnatural embarrassment on his face just now, and Earl Pierce said with feigned emotion:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I really didn't expect that my southeastern province would actually have the ability to produce high-quality iron on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line has a huge demand for weapons and equipment, especially the shortage of disposable weapons, which is a terrifying figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forging capacity of the logistics department is limited, and all the processing pressure is thrown on them, which cannot meet the needs of the front line at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Daw Leonard, please communicate with the Royal Capital's logistics department and explain to them the predicament we are facing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    See if you can adjust the supply of materials in the southeast province and replace some of them with weapons for delivery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Hudson, you have no problem processing these irons into weapons, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a politician, Governor Pierce is undoubtedly qualified, and he can see the crux of the problem at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he doesn't bring up this kind of thing, Hudson still has to push it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom had made preparations early, from the moment the war started, ordnance became consumables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary weapons and equipment are not consumed very quickly. Even if it is damaged, it can be repaired and repaired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disposable weapon consumables, such as: arrows, javelins, throwing spears... Basically, there is no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the soldiers defending the city, these consumable weapons will never be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even some ordinary knight spears and spears can be regarded as disposable weapons. Usually after a big battle, seven or eighty-eight will be damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily mass consumption on the front line is definitely not enough to rely on inventory alone. Since the outbreak of the war, the military production capacity of the Alpha Kingdom has exploded to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the huge consumption, the production speed obviously cannot keep up. Against this background, it is impossible for the Ministry of Logistics to refuse to add a new weapons production area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the disadvantaged party, you must go all out, and you can't be willful at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than waiting for Hudson to promote it, it is better for him, the governor, to propose it first. Not only sold a favor, but also created an image of taking care of the overall situation for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the problem of greedy eyes, we can wait until the end of the war. If Hudson had an accident on the battlefield, the Mountain Territory would be in the pocket of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conversely, if the Dalton family suffers heavy losses on the battlefield and loses their vitality, this favor can also come in handy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the melee where hundreds of thousands or even millions of troops participated on the front line, anything can happen. Smart people don't make enemies easily at this time when they don't have to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is Hudson's honor to be able to share the kingdom's worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only necessary to forge weapons on a large scale, and the mountain territory still lacks enough blacksmiths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to have the iron provided by the mountain leader, and everyone will share the heavy responsibility of forging weapons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can forge weapons for the kingdom are all old and powerful forces. Joining in suddenly will inevitably touch the interests of these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson never had any confidence in the integrity of the arms dealer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very necessary to bring together a group of allies to share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diluted the income, and the mountain collar was no longer so conspicuous. Even if there is trouble in the future, the families that have taken advantage of it can't just watch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, it can also be regarded as: the Koslow family joined the upper circle of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a small episode, the scene became much warmer. Earl Pierce is thinking about the iron in the Mountain Territory, and Hudson is also eyeing the port of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of traditional aristocrats, inland fertile land and fertile land are the best fiefdoms; but in Hudson's view, coastal territories like Watson with excellent ports are the best treasure lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greedy eyes are greedy, but the fiefdom that the Dalton family has operated for many years is not something he can peek at.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the busy and bustling port, Hudson's thoughts also began to wander. Perhaps the development plan for the swamp could be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before all of them are opened up as farmland, it will be more valuable for the development of the mountain territory to open a road leading to the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this is the first time you have experienced the magnificence of the sea, are you intimidated?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this familiar voice, Hudson knew that his contemplation just now had been misunderstood by his father-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interpretation is non-existent. As an aristocrat who grew up in an inland area, Hudson saw the sea for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shock gaffes are normal. If nothing happens, then there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Indeed! The magnificence of the sea is really beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, compared to these waves, I am more curious about the mystery of the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The endless sea monster legends and the legendary sea races are fascinating existences! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all true words, and he is really interested in these legends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to find gold in the sea, you can't do it without clarifying these issues. Hudson didn't think that he could play ocean trade by building a few ships at will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What sea monster legends are nothing more than some magical beasts that grow in the sea. It is very boastful, but in fact it is what it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was as powerful as in the legend, the sea route would have disappeared long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the legendary Sea Clan, there are really records in the history books. It seems mysterious, but it is actually no different from the alien races on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is nothing more than a group of intelligent creatures living in the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Great War in the Middle Ages, these sea creatures have abandoned the coastal areas and migrated to the deep sea to settle down, basically not interacting with us humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, many products in the sea are indeed rich. Some guys with good hands and eyes opened up trade with the Sea Clan and made a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of business is not enviable, it is all luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to open up trade with the Sea Clan, many forces have organized fleets to search for the creatures of the Sea Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person was indeed found, but the ending was a bit surprising. Trade lines have not been opened, but conflicts have occurred frequently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you stay in the port all the time, maybe one day you will meet fishermen who take the sea creatures they caught to the market for sale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the mysterious, supernatural, and omnipotent Sea Clan does not exist at all. Most of the sea creatures are pitifully weak. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are few intelligent creatures in the sea. In the special environment of the sea, the probability of being able to produce wisdom is much lower than that on land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if wisdom is born, it will be very difficult to derive a civilization in the face of various complex environments in the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a link in the food chain of each other, the sea people are divided severely, basically all the tribes go their own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sea Clan in a mess, naturally cannot bring pressure to the people, and it is inevitable that they will not be taken seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Kehai tribe is unified, it will be the largest ethnic group in the world. After all, the reproduction speed of the creatures in the sea is completely cheating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the checks and balances of the food chain, there would have been a flood of creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smiling slightly, Hudson did not continue to pick up the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignorance is not terrible, ignorance and running to discuss and tear up with others is too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's understanding of the Haizu is limited to some folklore. The materials of the Koslow family are all old materials hundreds of years ago, and they are still incomplete and scattered records.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if time is worthless to a race, hundreds of years can still affect the development of a civilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the longevity race is an exception. For a race like the giant dragon that can sleep for hundreds of years in a single sleep, hundreds of years really can't change anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shipment work continues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone just came over to take a look, to express the high-level position of the province, and did not mean to swear an oath speech to boost morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of laborers are not worth thinking about by the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This gesture was made mainly to warn the bureaucrats in the specific implementation to be more peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the fully loaded ship leave port, Hudson...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The tragic scene made everyone who was used to seeing big scenes couldn't help but lose their composure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both warring parties were red-eyed. A human soldier had half of his head chopped off, but the instinct of the body still stabbed the last shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people have been severely injured, and the first reaction is not their own injuries, but to continue the attack in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This almost instinctive reaction clearly turns people into war machines, as if they were born specifically for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am not qualified to criticize, because the enemy on the opposite side is an orc. In the face of the life-and-death crisis of genocide, any means should be taken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is recorded on the photo stone is just a small episode of the front line in northern Xinjiang. There are many similar battle scenes on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These photo stones are all recording the battle situation on the front line. What you saw was just a small-scale encounter. Similar battles happen countless times on the front line every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army is severely polarized. Those who are not good are really bad, and those who are fierce are really fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you encounter those cannon fodder races, you can easily kill them, but once you encounter powerful races, our human soldiers will suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry that appeared in the battle were just ordinary prairie werewolves. They were at the middle level in the orc empire, and their combat effectiveness was almost the same as that of our elite human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced by the five royal families of orcs, the scene would be even more tragic. Especially the most powerful Behemoth family, the fighting power is the most terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every adult man of the Beamon tribe has the fighting power of a junior knight. After training, the combat effectiveness will be even stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering the Beamon army, there is no more than ten times the strength advantage, so don't hesitate, just avoid it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the kingdom's most elite troops are no match for them with the same size of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I tell you this, not to make you fear and avoid war, but to remind you that this war is very dangerous, and the enemy is far stronger than you imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you are on the battlefield, don't try to be smart and take the initiative to play something. Just follow the orders from above and do what you need to do. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone didn't react much to Earl Pierce's warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the port inspection, everyone was drawn to watch the movie, and everyone was prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can a country that mobilizes the whole country ignore the training of military officers. Even if you are still behind, you have to learn in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom's reserve team, the biggest advantage is that you can learn from previous combat experience. These tragic clips are the best teaching materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the battle screen, we can see the combat effectiveness of the orc armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson had no idea why the kingdom didn't advocate taking the initiative. It is the precious experience summed up by the predecessors with **** lessons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that it's not good to take the initiative to attack. The crux of the problem is that the ordinary noble private army simply doesn't have the strength to fight against the elite beastmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the fighter is, someone still needs to execute it. Except for some elites, most armies do not have this ability to execute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the defense is simpler. Relying on fortifications, even ordinary soldiers can bring damage to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is to easily stabilize the morale of the army. The...broth boiling in the orc camp is the best morale stabilizer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how heavy the casualties are, the defenders who don't want to be reduced to food can only fight the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like in a field battle, you can still run if you can't beat it. Once the casualties exceed the critical point of morale, the supervising team will not be able to prevent the collapse of the army's morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fortresses on the border are all made of special materials. The power of the magic attack falling on the city wall will be weakened a lot, often only half of the normal period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some important fortresses even have defensive magic circles inside. The orcs are just not good at magic attacks, creating the best conditions for defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, no matter how strong the fortress is, it will eventually be conquered one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not good at magic attacks, that's only relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the magical power of an empire is concentrated, even forbidden spells can be released, so how can a mere city wall be able to stop it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs failed to kill the Quartet, and the containment of the Kingdom's mage group was also a very important factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present is the backbone of the southeastern province. When it comes to the battlefield, they are also proper mid-level and high-level officers who need to be sent out to take charge of their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't beat them in advance, if someone wants to show off and act without authorization and lose the battle, the defense line of a theater may collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't take it seriously at first, but Earl Pierce's sharp eyes made him feel that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaintly, he seemed to feel that the ambiguous words were aimed at himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, is he so unreliable?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting all his achievements since his debut, Hudson can say bluntly that all of them can be called stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was so cautious when dealing with the **** of the Skull and Bones Society; how could he be a moth when he met the main force of the orc army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanation is to cover up, age disadvantage, it is easy to be automatically labeled as impulsive, middle school, ... labels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this distrust, Hudson simply looked at Earl Pierce in line with the principle: As long as I am not embarrassed, then embarrassment is someone else's principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After more than ten seconds, Earl Pierce suddenly changed the subject:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone must carefully read the content on the photo stone. How much knowledge you can learn from it depends on your own understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the above content is forbidden to be leaked, so as not to cause panic among the people below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom is indeed at a disadvantage on the front line, but only we know about this kind of thing. When you spread the word below, you still have to surround yourself with...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This question is not in a hurry for the time being. I believe that the frontline army will soon be able to win a big victory, which can be used for publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the mobilization sequence of the southeastern province is late, the time when we participated in the war is often the most tragic time of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the casualty rate of previous wars, everyone is actually almost the same. With bad luck, the whole army may still be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beasts don't care how many difficulties you have. If you want to come back from the battlefield alive, then show your true skills!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only your own private army, but also the private army of the nobles in the county must be trained...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war broke out for more than half a month, and there was not a single battle on the front line. Just think about how miserable the kingdom was suppressed by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can win later, it is because of political needs. Perhaps only the Lord of Dawn knows how much the Alpha Kingdom has to pay behind the scenes for a victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but when he mentioned \"annihilation\", his father-in-law's expression obviously tightened, as if he had been stepped on a sore foot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminiscent of the decline of the Holliser family due to a large-scale orc invasion, Hudson felt as if he had dug up the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of black history must not be mentioned. Even if it is a warning to future generations, it must be beautified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the decline of the Holliser family was not an ordinary defeat. Maybe it was due to their negligence and negligence, digging a hole and burying themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things happen in almost every war. Even though there are many lessons learned before, everyone still keeps stepping on the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to confirm the sentence that the only lesson that humans can learn from history is-humans never learn from history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What he said is very good. We need to learn from the experience and lessons of the predecessors, but when it comes to the actual operation, we still can't help stepping on the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is considered good. We have been in distress, but we are still forced to make progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows how to avoid the pits that the predecessors stepped on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone still falls, at least when they fall into the same pit, the posture and orientation of everyone's whereabouts will still change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting the baptism of documentaries, Hudson has a deeper understanding of the cruelty of war. To say I learned anything from it would be pure bullshit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can learn how to fight with soldiers by watching a few battle movies, then the **** of war will fly all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's abilities have improved, and the story has returned to the original point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to be cheeky and go back with my father-in-law to learn more about the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just thought of the Holliser family, who are also a bunch of landlubbers now. Their understanding of the sea is only superficial, and Hudson had to give up again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering intelligence, the most important thing is accuracy. It is really difficult to verify the authenticity of the materials that have not been personally involved, but are just hearsay materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the feces of the nobles, Hudson has every reason to believe that those with vested interests will release fake news to trap latecomers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This invisible threshold, Hudson has come into contact with a lot. If he hadn't been careful enough, he would have fallen into the pit and been buried long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back to the Mountain Territory, Hudson immediately ordered the lords from all walks of life to strengthen their training in the name of the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show importance, evaluation rules were specially formulated to regularly test the training results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rewards are limited to words, but punishments are real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an unfair reward and punishment model is not Hudson's first creation, but everyone is playing it like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Caesar III fulfilled his promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The province that performed the most hips in the early preparations has now led the team to the front line, stationed in the most dangerous fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic scene in the picture stone is most likely their current situation. When I met an army of unreasonable orcs, I only talked to them about fists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fairness is only relative, and the weak never have the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most unlucky province has come out, but there is still one unlucky county in the lead in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counties are now competing with each other, whoever slackens down first will be the unlucky one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding weight layer by layer, of course there will be the most unlucky lords in each county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if it's delayed, but if it hurts everyone to escape death, this kind of hatred is irreconcilable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of life and death, even brothers can turn their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened that the unlucky Sith was not there at this time, and no one dared to come out to make trouble, so Hudson promulgated the military law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific content is very simple, it is a replica of the serf soldiers who led before. There is only one \"sit together\" at the core, forcing everyone to supervise each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Punishment is not for nobles, Hudson still made adjustments in line with the rules of the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When nobles commit crimes, they are the captains of the \"Death Squad\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if there are many accomplices, just set up a few more death squads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many dangerous things on the battlefield, there is no need to worry about the opportunity for them to perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir, during your absence, several special guests came to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering their special status, it is inconvenient for them to stay outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I decided on my own and placed it in the other courtyard of the Lord's Mansion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler said with a complicated expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the way he looked at Hudson was different. It was as if he was worried about a secret that he knew and shouldn't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What special guest?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back on what I have done, although I can't say everything is aboveboard, but overall I am worthy of the title of nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who come and go are also nobles from all walks of life. Perhaps the level of strength is uneven, but there is absolutely no hidden danger in the identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, you should go and see for yourself! People have come to your door, so it's not good if you don't admit it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler said with a embarrassed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, the teacup in Hudson's hand almost fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Looking at the door\", \"Don't accept the account\", these are all the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought he acted rightly and sat upright, so he didn't do anything wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be the pot left by the original owner?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's not right either!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he crossed over, the original owner was still a kid, even if he wanted to, he was powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without too much entanglement, Hudson came all the way to the other courtyard. After seeing the person coming, Hudson's face turned green.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, what are you doing? Who let you live here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't have self-cultivation, but the identity of the person in front of him is too special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they were in the capital, there were rumors that there was a special relationship between the two. Now that Isabel has appeared in the Mountain Territory, the rumors that Hudson jumped into the Lancang River can't be cleared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a nobleman with a fiancée, engaging in such an affair before marriage is easily considered disrespectful and insincere by the woman's family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it can be explained clearly, it will be difficult to solve the matter if it involves the face of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, have you forgotten so soon?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was invited here, and at the banquet that day, you told me...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jiao Didi's voice sounded, making Hudson's face even more ugly, and immediately sent his men to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, don't act here, I dare not invite your boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't care what your background is, but don't forget whose territory this is, Miss Isabel! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No more pretending!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I was outside, I was concerned about my own image, so I didn't want to do anything to her. When it comes to their own land, everything will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't give a reasonable explanation, Hudson is not going to let this trouble go away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A beautiful woman, or a beautiful woman with a great reputation, can cause him a lot of trouble if she is placed outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps sensing the murderous look in Hudson's eyes, Isabel's expression changed. She wanted to give up this **** mission a long time ago, but unfortunately the mysterious organization behind it refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She was able to have today's status, and the mysterious organization also contributed a lot. Without the support of these people behind the scenes, I'm afraid she would have become the plaything of a certain big shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the benefits are not for nothing. Enjoying the benefits of joining the mysterious organization, naturally you have to pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, they were all small tasks, and they were completed with ease, and I didn't feel that there was anything wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation this time is obviously different, the target is the famous Blood Moon Horn. Anyone who has this thing in his hand will not take it out easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, you don't have to be so serious, do people have any malice towards you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell you the truth, a mysterious organization has received news that the corner of the Blood Moon has entered your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a weak woman, I unfortunately accepted this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from you men all day long, the little girl doesn't like to fight and kill, so I came here to discuss with you to see if I can transfer the Blood Moon Horn. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Isabel also tentatively narrowed the distance between the two to observe Hudson's reaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To disappoint Ms. Isabel, I don't have any Blood Moon Horn in my hand. Instead of coming here to discuss the Blood Moon Horn, let's talk about romance.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson took advantage of the situation and greeted him, as if he really wanted to talk about love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already begun to scold his mother. Obviously what I did was very careful, but I didn't expect that the news still leaked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is uncertain now is whether the other party is just suspicious, or really believes that the Blood Moon Horn is in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soft fragrance is in the bosom, and the aroma is tangy. Before she had time to enjoy it, Isabel broke free directly, and even Hudson, a senior knight, couldn't stop her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Unexpectedly, Miss Isabel is still a master. It seems that I will not be able to enjoy this beauty!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson spread his hands and smiled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be honest, if it was an ordinary singer, maybe he would have quietly entered the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this beautiful woman whose identity is unknown and not weak, rationality tells him that it is better not to be superior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's not necessarily the case, this is the territory of the mountains. In your territory, the little girl is not allowed to let you torment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel, who came back to her senses, regained her charm again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength is exposed, and experience tells her that if she wants to get out of the body, she must use the most advantageous weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Miss Isabel, it would be the best to have this awareness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beautiful scenery on a good day…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could finish his molesting words, Isabel spoke again:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, although the Blood Moon Horn has a great name, it actually has no real effect on Your Excellency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of keeping this hot potato, why not make an offer first and see if we can negotiate terms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After completing this task, people can leave the mysterious organization, and then we can...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Isabel's temptation, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. If I really wanted to have something to do with him, I wouldn't have resisted so fiercely just now, and I didn't even care about hiding my strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he handed over the Horn of the Blood Moon so easily, then he would really be taken advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can embrace a beautiful woman, it is still a **** business. The value of the blood moon horn can buy the entire rainbow moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was very simple to refuse, but the real trouble was that the other party seemed to believe that the Horn of the Blood Moon was in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Horn of the Blood Moon is not in the mountain area, Miss Isabel brought someone to look for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you just wait for me to come back, you don't have to ignore your reputation and pretend to be my concubine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if the price is right, I don't mind being a middleman to help you contact the real owner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, no matter whether the transaction is successful or not, my compensation will be indispensable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson pretended to be obsessed with staring at Isabel, as if he was really dazed, and put his restless hands together again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from before, Isabel, who was focused on the blood moon horn, did not avoid Hudson immediately, but instead asked charmingly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who owns the thing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson said with a smile on the pink face in front of him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm sorry, Miss Isabel. You are so charming that people can't help it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, you won't believe the truth. Then say something you want to believe!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am a coward by nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, before I figure out your origin, I can only wrong you first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you can rest assured that I did not prescribe any medicine to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a knight, I still understand this rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just learned a little magic recently, and I haven't had time to cast it yet. I just asked Miss Isabel to test the effect today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure negative energy will only make you temporarily lose the power to resist, and will not harm your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you answer my few questions well, your body will recover in a while. After all, I am also sympathetic. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The simple introduction fell into the ears of Isabel, but it was like falling into an abyss. Tremblingly said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you a necromancer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could there be such a young undead magister?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless...you...are not Viscount Hudson...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more I thought about it, the more terrifying I felt. Isabel's face instantly turned pale, and in the end even her voice became intermittent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If magicians who pursue the truth are a group of research freaks; then necromancers are a group of lunatics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    fell into the hands of Hudson, Isabel can still try to save herself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She thinks she has a good understanding of men's thoughts. In the absence of hatred, there are very few people who can deal with a delicate beauty like her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But facing a necromancer who doesn't know how many years he has lived, the so-called beauty is a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of mages who deal with corpses every day are different. Under the corrosion of Yin Qi, their bodies may have lost their functions long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the bargaining chip to be proud of, Isabel is just as good as an ordinary woman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, there are certain things that cannot be said indiscriminately. For the sake of your beauty, I will give you another chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which side does the mysterious organization behind you belong to?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't say it directly, it's okay. I'll give you the answer, and you do the multiple choice questions. If you don't want to answer directly, hints are fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I am the most affectionate person. How can you introduce business to your friends without clarifying the identity of the transaction partner?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't object, it will be considered as your consent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holy See?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankish Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dante Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or Caesar III?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He talked about all the great human forces on the continent of Aslant in one breath, but Isabel didn't see any reaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson frowned, his big hands became restless, and Isabel was so frightened that he hurriedly explained: \"My lord, I really don't know!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has always been a one-way connection with the mysterious organization. I don't know who other members are besides contacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the tasks completed over the years, I can only roughly guess that it may be related to the Holy See. As for the authenticity, I really have no way to be sure! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that she is really frightened. Falling into the hands of a necromancer, death is not the most terrifying thing, what is even more terrifying is that the soul will not be at peace after death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, it turns out that you are just a pawn. It seems that it is difficult to get results if we only talk about this money with you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take this pill. Go back and tell your upline to send someone who can call the shots. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson fed the pill to Isabel regardless of whether she wanted it or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Her body regained some strength, but Isabel still didn't dare to move. She obediently lay down in Hudson's arms and asked softly, \"My lord, what is this pill?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, this is a good thing. As long as you obey, nothing will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is not hundreds of years ago. We can also become friends when we meet people from the Holy See. After the transaction is completed, you and I will have nothing to do with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you're dishonest, I can't guarantee what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or many a beauty doll, is also a good choice. Don't worry, my technique is good. Refining dolls can also retain your soul and help you live forever!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, you can also choose to tell the people behind the scenes and take a gamble to see if they have the ability to solve the troubles in your body for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of getting to know each other, I suggest you talk directly to the Pope, as no one else has the ability. Maybe he can ask the Lord of Dawn to take action in person to solve this hidden danger for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson bragged to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary people's fear of necromancers stems more from the unknown. Although Isabel's circle of contact is not low, but her background as a singer, it is still difficult for her to get in touch with the details of the Necromancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to outside rumors, as a lunatic necromancer, he can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only toss with corpses, but even living people are their experimental equipment. Refining dolls with living people is a kind of magic with high difficulty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The easier Hudson said, the more frightened Isabel became. If the undead magic is easy to break, the necromancer will not have the current promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, don't worry! I will definitely take care of things, and I will never disappoint you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Isabel was sent away, Hudson gained another \"identity as an undead magister\". I just don't know if I can bluff the mysterious organization behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Isabel is too smart, even if she entered the mysterious organization, she didn't ask for things she shouldn't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just some superficial information, and it can be regarded as a strong analytical ability if the object of suspicion can be locked on the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth behind the scenes, until the moment it is revealed, no one knows who is the real black hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the top powers, it is perfectly normal to go out and do things in other people's vests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson really hopes that the culprit behind the scenes is the Holy See, which means that the blood moon horn in his hand can be sold for a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the black hand is in the Alpha Kingdom, or King Caesar III, then the moment the curtain is lifted is when Hudson himself sends the things over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rewards, purely dreaming. If you find something like the Blood Moon Horn, but you didn't turn it in to the boss immediately, it's fine if you don't get punished, and you want to get a reward?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the Holy See, which everyone hates, now has more common languages. With the title of Necromancer, he is exactly the partner that the Holy See needs most now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cult organizations have supported it, and it is not surprising to support and fund the Necromancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood moon horn is a hot taste for nobles; for those who practice necromancers, it is a supreme treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the necromancer holding an \"evil weapon\" wants to make trouble, the scene will not be much smaller than the last time the skeletons made a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially where it appeared, it was still in the sensitive Alpha Kingdom. Once things get serious, the Holy See will take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of the orc invasion, running to stab one of your own people is not a crime that can be easily carried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once labeled as a \"traitor to the human race\", the Church of Dawn, which was already doing its own thing, would immediately fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Churches in various places can completely establish a separate Holy See in a reasonable and reasonable way. Even if the gods are not happy, the unlucky ones are first of all the people at the Holy See headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that starting from the signboard of the Necromancer, the Holy See must get the Blood Moon Horn back from Hudson, and the faster the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the swamp, countless orc slaves are constantly digging the mud. There is a group of serfs behind them, reinforcing the silt slopes on both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slaves do coolies, and serfs do technical work. There is a clear division of labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the experiences summed up in the process of developing the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to orc slaves, serfs are relatively better at learning. Based on the theoretical knowledge provided by Hudson, a set of reinforcement techniques was quickly explored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cooperating with each other in the construction, not only the efficiency has improved a lot compared to when they worked alone; even the happiness of the serfs has risen in a straight line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the pieces of land that have been divided, Hudson knows that this year's swampland development tasks are likely to be substantially overfulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the people below work harder, it's purely because the number of people working has increased. Originally there were more than 300 construction teams, but now they have directly expanded to more than 500.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of a large number of serfs and hired labor has injected new impetus into the rapid development of the mountainous territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of shoulders and shoulders, more people means more strength. Whether it is mining production, or mountain land reclamation, or swampland development, the speed is rising steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patted the cub on the head, Hudson pointed to a green paddy field and said: \"See, Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those are your property, from now on, you are already one of the richest bears among the contemporary earth bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now take me for a walk in the swamp to see how many sites are still undeveloped, so that we can plan for the next step. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the swamp, Hudson has long wanted to inspect it. However, the bottomless mud is a forbidden area for human beings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, he can only fool his own bear. Although it is not a creature in the swamp, Bear Stearns has a great reputation in this area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development of the swamp was not all smooth sailing. On the way, they were often attacked by swamp creatures, and the army supervising the construction fought these alien creatures many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, it was Bear Stearns who struck a devastating blow to these incoming races. The creatures who had escaped by chance, now smelled the breath of the bear of the earth, and immediately ran away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was just the feces excreted by Bear Stearns, as long as it was put there, it would be difficult to see the swamp creatures within a few miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that every time he is dispatched, it is Mr. Bear Stearns who goes out to play by himself, and he is not willing to bring Hudson with him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So that the swamp has been developed for so long, Hudson only has a rough estimate of the swamp, without a specific concept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that he wants to open up a sea line of communication in this swamp, Hudson is not at ease if he doesn't go out to investigate on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you don't have any big plans, do you? Take the lead in stating that I don't have any money in my pocket right now. Don't worry about my last coffin book and my daily expenses.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said with a vigilant face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From being fooled into participating in Hudson's territory development plan, its good days are over. It is both money and effort, and the easy-to-use bear-headed melon seeds are quickly recollected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, investment is risky. Naturally, there is no reason to return the project funds invested. It was clearly written in black and white, and it was not easy to deny it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the tens of thousands of acres of fertile land developed, Xiong, who was unwilling to see his investment go in vain and let Hudson get all the benefits, finally gritted his teeth and persisted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The working habit is terrible. From the resistance at the beginning, to the gradual adaptation, it lasted for a long time, and Bear Stearns got used to coming to work every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having learned from previous experience and lessons, Bear Stearns is extremely strict about the property reserved for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for daily consumption, I have no interest in any other investment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the great Mr. Bear Stearns. The swamp development funds have not been spent yet, and you don't need to increase capital investment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to my arrangement, I will be able to enter the balance of payments soon. You don't need to worry about my management ability at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I just go out for a walk and check the area of ​​this swamp. By the way, observe the surrounding terrain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are dangerous areas, you just bypass them. Pick the nearest road, let's go to the beach first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell the truth, there is no Xiong Xin, and he is also speechless. How did the trust between people and \"bears\" become like this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the hesitant Bear Stearns, Hudson couldn't help sighing secretly: the wisdom of the combat partners is too high, which is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that all the \"beast knights\" in the continent of Aslant are not less troubled by this problem. There are not a few sad knights who are unable to step down by their own monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No amount of trouble can stop everyone's desire for Warcraft. Having one more combat partner not only increases one's strength, but also gives one more life on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of defeat on the battlefield, with a monster mount, the running speed will be faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of previous continental wars, the death rate of Warcraft knights has always been the lowest. As long as you are not too unlucky, you can basically run away if you are entangled by the strong enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Hudson! I've been familiar with this territory for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being covered by this bear, as long as you don't try to kill yourself, there will be no danger. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns patted his chest and promised with confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that embarrassing expression, he was clearly telling Hudson: Uncle Xiong is very powerful, praise me quickly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you want to open up the sea line of communication in a short period of time, the vast swamp is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"arrive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words fell, the giant bear's body shrank rapidly. Caught off guard, Hudson almost fell from the tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the innocent Bear Stearns, Hudson was furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you stop suddenly, you have been reminded after all, but you have to stay on the ground anyway?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you like to settle on trees, at least you should choose a bigger one. As far as the tree where Hudson is now, a little carelessness is an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around, Hudson regretfully found that the place that seemed to be within reach of the naked eye was barely a tree under him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ground is full of shrubs and weeds. Experience tells Hudson that this is a saline-alkali land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected, there are very few swamps in coastal areas with low salinity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swampland developed by the family has a slightly higher salinity than ordinary soil. It's just that the height is not much, and it does not affect food cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These coastal areas are often impacted by sea water, and the plants that can grow here are all salt-tolerant species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little estimation of the distance, this place is about two hundred miles away from the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The formation of such a large swamp, in addition to the erosion of sea water, is also likely to be related to the nearby terrain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province has plenty of rain, and the water from the Salam Mountains flows in, which is the area that Hudson is currently developing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a Black Rock Mountain Range next door, which is also an area with abundant rainwater, and it is inevitable that stagnant water will flow in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The origin of the swamp is not important, the key is the current development and utilization. One person and one bear advanced along the coast, and the tumbling sea made Hudson frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his poor common sense of life, he knew that if he wanted to develop the coastal area, he had to build a sea defense levee first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without keeping the seawater out, the salinity in the land cannot be lowered. The high-salt land can only grow a small amount of crops, and the cost performance is extremely low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of the port has not been determined after all. It would be very irresponsible to choose a site based on shore observation without conducting field surveys in this sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, Bear Stearns can not help. The bear of the earth is only awesome on land, but it is also nothing in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Teach a \"bear\" to swim?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, it was decisively suppressed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Species talent must be respected. No matter how good the water quality is, people are still land creatures, and it is impossible to live in water for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"bear\" is similar in thinking. Maybe after spending eight thousand years by the water, it is possible to evolve the ability to survive in water, but Hudson doesn't think he can wait until that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go, Bear Stearns. Take a turn around the swamp, and today's task is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slow down, I want to observe the terrain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slowness is relative. Hudson on the back of a bear still enjoys the treatment of flying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the height from the ground, there is actually no difference between the running Bear Stearns and Fei.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doubted very much that Bear Stearns could fly. After running for hundreds of miles in the swamp, his feet didn't even get a little mud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Bear Stearns firmly insisted that he couldn't. For the incident of flying bears with all four feet off the ground, it gave an explanation—talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, talent is the most unreasonable existence. There is no way to explain the strange talents possessed by many races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually everyone attributes these unexplained weird events to gods. Either a good **** did it, or an evil **** did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other theories are only spread among special professions such as magician and arcanist. The mainstream idea is that the gods created all things in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ran all the way into a mountain range, and based on his own geographical knowledge, Hudson came to the conclusion of the Blackstone Mountain Range at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time it is a real mountain range. It can be seen from the towering mountain tops that it is not comparable to the small dirt bag in the own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountains are connected to mountains, endlessly. How vast the Black Rock Mountain Range is, Hudson doesn't know, anyway, the naked eye can't see the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, are there powerful monsters haunting this mountain?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a neighbor, you should care about it. The fact that the Blackstone Mountains can block the connection between the Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Hesse is definitely not just due to geographical factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simple geographical difficulties, moving mountains and seas, breaking mountains and cracking rocks, the extraordinary world is not impossible to complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if both sides have no ambitions, it is not too much to open up a trade route, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for the two countries to act, and profit-seeking merchants will explore by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes! I can feel a few breaths that are not weak. No one knows how many high-level monsters are hidden in this mountain range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You'd better not make trouble in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of a fight, I have no problem, and your safety is hard to say. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said old-fashionedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tone is as if Hudson is a naughty child who caused trouble and needs the parent to deal with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolling his eyes angrily, Hudson immediately put off his exploration thoughts. Warcraft have a sense of territory, and rushing in rashly can easily lead to a fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' words were harsh, but his strength was also impressive. Hudson really doesn't want to provoke the existence that can make it jealous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having these neighbors in the way is a good thing in a sense. At the very least, if the enemies in the south want to spy on the mountain leaders, they must first ask these local snakes if they are willing to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to change the target if you spend a lot of money to push it all the way. In the war-torn Aslante Continent, there has never been a lack of opportunities for expansion, what is lacking is strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a round of inspection, Hudson had a rough idea in his mind. The swampland in front of my house is not generally vast, probably covering an area of ​​tens of thousands of square kilometers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much it is will not be known until it is developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the route Bear Stearns took was irregular, and the error in judging the area by only the perimeter of a curve is still very large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the bottom line in his heart, Hudson's idea of ​​heading towards the sea became more and more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Digging a canal of hundreds of miles, even if it is a swamp full of silt, is not a small project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, it is almost one-thirtieth of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. If it weren't for the extraordinary world, Hudson would not have dared to have this idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to calculate the amount of earthwork, it is an astronomical figure anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swamp is flat and developed into a large plain. There is no need to worry about the water source, as the accumulated water from the Salam Mountains can fill the river.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient flow in the dry season is only a small problem. The big deal is to repair the gates at the sea outlet to allow ships to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What needs to be considered now is the canal width, depth, the amount of labor input, and the estimated time for digging the canal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, such a large project must be carefully considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a large amount of manpower and material resources are invested, it cannot be stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the progress of the project is not as expected, and the follow-up is affected by the war, and there is not enough financial resources to invest, it will be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or how about putting thousands of people in and digging slowly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the financial resources of the Mountain Territory, only a canal excavation team was allocated, which had limited impact on the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or put the plan on hold for the time being, and wait until the war is over before considering this issue?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, since the outbreak of the war, it has been busy here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military newspapers on the front line are flying over continuously. Overall, there is more bad news than good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either there were heavy losses here, or there were casualties over there, or a certain fortress was breached by an army of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Kingdom's army didn't try to organize a counterattack, but the record is a bit unreliable, and they are embarrassed to use it for publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, during the frontline days, the Kingdom's army won a complete victory in Fort Helan, annihilating more than 5,000 piggies, and self-inflicted losses of only 800.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the numbers alone, this is a big victory. It's a pity that the enemy is Pig, so that when the kingdom advertises, it can only be replaced by an orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many orc armies were annihilated, so there is no need to say, the ones who were killed must be the enemy's low-level race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the elite orcs are wiped out, they will usually be given the name of the enemy's race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, last week, one hundred Bimon soldiers were killed, which was described in detail in the battle report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out. In order to crack down on false reports of achievements, the Kingdom made a rule early on that all military exploits on the front line must be recorded with photo stones before they can be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all genuine data, so the battle report is naturally not so good-looking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is as beautified as possible, it can still be seen through by the high-level officials of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing at the compiled battle reports, he still couldn't find a classic battle that could be written about. Caesar III said helplessly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the front line deploy according to their actual situation, there is no need to take risks with the elite for the sake of political propaganda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For external publicity, just use the total number of enemies wiped out!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One month after the war started, 150,000 orc coalition forces were annihilated, which was barely enough to appease the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of losing cities and lands means that the battle situation is anxious, and we are fighting around these areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inform the neighbors of the predicament we are facing, and prepare more photo stones to send there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't let them see the tragedy of the battlefield, I'm afraid they won't be able to get up the support! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of racial factors, the army of the Alpha Kingdom is absolutely outstanding. Since the start of the war, no more than 70,000 people have been lost, and the number of enemies wiped out has exceeded 150,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone knows the moisture in it. As a defensive side, just playing such a record is obviously not satisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the tragedy of the northern border battlefield is well known to all, and there are large pages of descriptions in the history books of various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the tragedy that countries are unwilling to spend their strength in fighting the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is arguing, nominally discussing the number of troops to send, but in fact everyone is planning to consume the strength of others first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, it is unrealistic to obtain reinforcements from various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refer to the responses of countries in previous wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically, when we have suffered heavy losses and are about to fail, reinforcements will come slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of asking for reinforcements, it is better to ask for strategic materials, which is easier for countries to meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food and cloth, weapons and armor, magic spar...these are what we need urgently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, we can also let countries send experts to support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Top powerhouses have a high survival rate on the battlefield. As long as they are not besieged by the enemy, they are basically not too dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are peoples who are righteous and will not lose their strength. All countries should agree. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was almost bald because of the matter of asking for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it still has little effect. Every country in the mainland has their own little calculations. The righteousness of the human race is of course important, but didn't the Alpha Kingdom stand up to it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of all countries, in the past, the Alpha Kingdom was able to withstand the attack of the orcs. Now that there are more Warhammer Kingdoms and the Principality of Moxi, it is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the Three Kingdoms at the front, they can take care of their own affairs first, and then slowly come back to clean up the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in countries bordering other races, the mind is even more complicated now. Rather than supporting the Three Kingdoms, they want to solve their own troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that reinforcements cannot be obtained in a short period of time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can only lower the target and strive for support from other parties as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking into the distance disappointedly, Caesar III said disappointedly: \"Then let's do this first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pay attention to the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moshi, they are too quiet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously abnormal for the five royal families of the orcs to come to our side. Maybe there is a big conspiracy waiting for them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persimmon was looking for something soft to pinch, but this time the orcs invaded, and the strongest Alpha Kingdom was caught and beat up as soon as they came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line has been passively beaten, and has not won a brilliant victory. It is not that the Kingdom's army is not strong, but the enemy is too fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the orcs has come, and the cautious border defenders have adopted the most conservative response plan. Although there is no outstanding record, but after all, they have held the line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, as long as the line of defense cannot be broken through immediately, the next step will be a protracted war of attrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on one line of defense, the kingdom's reinforcements can be continuously replenished, and the orc army can be slowly exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the process of attrition, although the kingdom's army suffered heavy losses, it was able to hone a large number of elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the provinces who had just arrived at the front line had very average combat effectiveness, but after the war lasted for a year and a half, most of these surviving soldiers had completed their transformation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the generals are more powerful and trained, an elite team can be created soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The comprehensive national strength is getting weaker and weaker, but the frontline army is getting stronger and stronger. Once a new force joins in, the situation will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous battlefields in northern Xinjiang, the orcs were driven back to their hometowns in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having failed so many times, it makes no sense not to learn from it. It is obviously not in the interests of the Orc Empire to keep fighting against the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the past, when the orcs came to rob, there was more movement than now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes to be beaten. It is a good thing after all that the main direction of attack is not on your side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Order the defenders on the front line to be on strict alert and not to attack without authorization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people to keep an eye on the movement of the main force of the orcs, and be careful that the enemy will suddenly change the direction of the main attack with a feint shot. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the weakest family among the Three Kingdoms. As a reminder to the Alpha Kingdom, Chris IX dare not take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the orc army suddenly turned their guns and gave them a sudden ruthless attack, the Principality of Moxi might become history directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it has been operating in the north for decades, it still cannot compare with the Alpha Kingdom in terms of defense capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic lords of the Principality of Moxi are not the nail households in the Alpha Kingdom who have been hammered by the orcs for hundreds of years and are still strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle line collapsed, and the noble castles still persisted until the end of the war, and there were not a few of them in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Certain well-known castles have been besieged dozens of times by orc armies in the past few hundred years, and they still stand in the North.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the war was at its worst, it was not uncommon for the capital to fall. It was not once or twice that the capital was temporarily moved to southern Xinjiang provinces to persist in resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom was able to stand strong because of their rich experience in being beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things are difficult to accept when encountering them for the first time. As long as you experience them more times, you will gradually get used to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the Principality of Moxi can bear it, Chris IX has no idea at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, he did not dare to make plans in advance for the collapse of the front line, the fall of the capital, and the relocation of the capital to continue the resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan that can be discussed publicly in the Alpha Kingdom, Chris IX can't even reveal this kind of meaning, otherwise the domestic nobles will be able to fry the pot immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Majesty, it will not be easy for the orc army to sneak attack. The mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops is so huge that it is impossible to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only us who are calm now, but also the Warhammer Kingdom next door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs grabbed the Alpha Kingdom and beat them up, probably because of history. They were originally feuds, and the beast kings of all generations had set the goal of destroying the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the grievances between us and the orcs are not deep. If it weren't for the orc tribes who often went south to rob, there would be no conflicts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these reasons are not sufficient, there are only so many he can think of. From a military point of view, it must be to pick weak links to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to gnaw hard bones first. But the problem is that there is a defense line behind the defense line of the Alpha Kingdom, and every noble castle is a ready-made fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My ancestors have managed the castle for countless years, and even have rich experience in dealing with the siege of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are nails along the way. If they can't be pulled out, the threat to the army's rear is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Historically, the army of orcs who bypassed these nails and forcibly moved southward ended in tragedy without exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, how can I be so relieved! Even because of hatred, the orc army recklessly attacked the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after being hit badly, can the orc not learn his lesson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom lost a large piece of territory in the north during the last war, the border between them and the orcs was also shortened by half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the orcs are playing fiercely now, in terms of defensive pressure, I am afraid it is far from what it used to be. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said rather tangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the allies is definitely a good thing for the overall situation. But if the allies can't make a breakthrough, the enemy will point their guns at them, which is embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is very obvious. Which country the orc army will make a breakthrough in next will be the most viciously beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, it was able to persist until after the war, and with the support of the nations of the human race, the country was restored. If luck is bad, the royal family will cool down early, and the foundation will belong to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either a certain noble in the country rises, or it is annexed by a neighboring country. The newly-emerged royal family is at most somewhat related to the former royal family in terms of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king can be replaced, it will be easier for the nobles below to be replaced. If the loss of family strength is too heavy, it is only a matter of time before they are replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Warhammer Kingdom on the other side is also not peaceful. There are a few smart people in any country. Even if the king doesn't find the problem, people around him will remind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collective stupidity of the ruling class is only a small probability event after all. When it comes to matters of life and death, no one dares to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most optimistic aristocrats can't guarantee that the orcs will continue to fight against the Alpha Kingdom and will not change the direction of attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that pleased Joseph II was that the orcs were now mainly attacking the thick-skinned Alpha Kingdom, and there was no need for them to send people to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the target of the beating turned out to be the Principality of Moxi next door, it is estimated that rescue letters would have flooded his desk, urging him to send troops to rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lips are cold and the teeth are dead. If any family is broken by the orc army, the enemy can attack them in a roundabout way. The three \"bad brothers and bad brothers\" will all be unlucky together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is the reaction of the mainland countries now, have they agreed to send reinforcements?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland in the last era, the orcs are not only the enemies of the Three Kingdoms, but also the enemies of the entire human race. Facing the enemy of the race, it is natural to pull everyone together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, combining the power of the Three Kingdoms can also fight the orcs to the death. Judging from the current situation on the battlefield, it is only in theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't work hard, it's that the two sides are facing different situations. The orc army can use the corpses of their companions as rations, but the human army can't be so crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the troops that can be mobilized by the Three Studs, the logistical pressure alone can directly cause the front line to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supporting millions of troops to fight has already made the three countries do their best. To train the young and strong from all over the country into an army and send them all to the battlefield is purely talk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of no breakthrough in transportation, it is not feasible to mobilize tens of millions of troops to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing the Three Kingdoms can do is slowly attrition with the Orc Empire. Although there are many cannon fodder troops of the orcs, they still have their limits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability to reproduce is fast, and it is not enough to be an adult at birth. The cannon fodder is almost consumed, and it is the turn of the elite to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was the turn of the direct descendants of the family, the five royal families also needed to feel distressed. For example, the Beamon royal family with the smallest population, once they lose tens of thousands of troops on the front line, their own strength will immediately be shattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the four imperial courts is better, but overall it is much better. Losing tens of thousands of elites will also hurt; losing hundreds of thousands of elites will also hurt muscles and bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is fair in the world, while giving these races great power, also weakens their fertility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous wars, as long as the five royal families suffered heavy losses, the war would end soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not even necessary for the five families to be severely injured at the same time. As long as one or two of them suffer heavy losses, they may choose to withdraw their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such thing as dead knocking. Orcs are not stubborn, if they were so reckless, they would have already become history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"National countries have condemned the shameless behavior of the orcs. Some countries have promised to consider providing assistance to our three countries in the near future. The specific actions will have to wait for the next Terran Alliance meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the call of the Kingdom of the Franks, each country sent representatives to Lutetia to participate in the 17th Human Race Alliance Conference in July this year to discuss how to deal with the current complicated situation on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, in addition to discussing the issue of alien races, the Franks may propose a proposal that is not conducive to the Holy See at the meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are in a very stalemate with the Holy See. The new Archbishop of the Frankish Region publicly announced that he will not accept any orders from the Holy See, and questioned the legitimacy of Pope Pius VII. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, Joseph was so angry that his beard was about to stand on end. They fought the orcs on the front line, while the human nations behind them watched the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While talking about support, when it comes to specific actions, everyone pushes back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds nice to be discussing and discussing, but it sounds ugly to find an excuse to shirk, not wanting to waste one's own strength in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only March now, and there are still four full months before July. It will take four months for the Human Race Alliance meeting to be held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we wait until all the countries have finished their discussions and come up with a proper plan for dispatching troops, we don't know when we will have to wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Joseph II couldn't help but greet his ancestors. Why did you want to watch the show during the last orc invasion, and help the Alpha Kingdom earlier, so as not to put yourself in a dangerous situation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after experiencing the cruelty of the orc invasion, can you know how good it is to have someone blocking the knife in front. It's a pity that time cannot be turned back, and now the Warhammer Kingdom can only bite the bullet by itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, he would not mind supporting the Alpha Kingdom to regain lost ground. Joseph can guarantee that the nobles of the Warhammer Kingdom will never be jealous this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the group of nobles in the border area, they have been tortured by the orcs in recent decades, and many small and medium nobles are almost unable to support themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Warhammer Kingdom also imitating its neighbors and subsidizing the nobles in the border areas, it is estimated that many small and medium nobles who are on the verge of bankruptcy can only leave their territories and run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is so critical, the human race is still busy fighting among themselves. At another point in time, the Franks want to target the Holy See, and he definitely doesn't mind adding fuel to the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Questioning the pope's illegitimacy is a lot of fun. It would not be a good king if he did not take part in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the struggle between kingship and theocracy. As a king, there is no need to think about which side to sit on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But not now, Warhammer Kingdom needs support. Any struggle within the human race will weaken the support of the major forces for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha and the Holy See fell out, but the Kingdom of Warhammer had not yet broken with the Holy See. Joseph II had to come out and call for a timeout for his own benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, his right to speak seems to be somewhat insufficient. As one of the top ten kingdoms in the mainland, the Frankish Kingdom is the overlord, the Alpha Kingdom can also be ranked in the top three, but the Warhammer Kingdom is at the bottom of the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the title of \"Top Ten Kingdoms\" was uttered by several of them. In fact, there is still a big gap between the previous kingdoms and the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the kingdoms of the people behind, let alone. The water in it is not so big. Being able to call a kingdom does not necessarily mean that it is powerful, but it may also mean that its ancestors are awesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will contact the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi to see if the three countries can come forward together and call on them to exercise restraint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, if the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom fight, it would be terrible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but he always feels like he can't finish it. Things on the front line have to be taken care of, issues of allies have to be considered, and even the situation on the mainland has to be worried about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turbulent situation in the mountainous territory made Hudson also have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the kingdom's public battle report, his face was almost green with anger. This kind of **** record, are you embarrassed to take it out for publicity?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the eyes of others, the orc army is a terrifying, evil, and powerful existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Master Hudson, who has tens of thousands of slaves, said: Orcs are nothing special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was as powerful as in the legend, the mountain leaders would have been overthrown by these guys long ago. How could they work honestly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the defensive side, they had a garbage record of 1 to 2, and most of the opponents were a group of cannon fodder troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't even know how to comment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not boasting, the tens of thousands of slave riots under his own command only need a few hundred elites to suppress them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most orc cannon fodder races have very limited combat effectiveness. Hudson doesn't think that the Orc Empire is capable of equipping all cannon fodder with armored weapons. Maybe some orc cannon fodder still fight with wooden sticks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy losses of the defenders obviously cannot be caused by these orc cannon fodder. Then there is a high probability that an encounter will occur, and they will fight against the elite orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a moment, Hudson thought of \"political needs.\" It is estimated that the generals on the front line used it as political propaganda in order to fight a good battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the ideal is full, but the reality is very slapping. The beautiful battle was not fought, but was blasted by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I can only hope that the frontline generals can be more rational, and stop doing anything for the sake of military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No accidents on the front line, it is the biggest benefit for the mountain leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will take a year or two, and when the time comes to go to the battlefield, he, Master Hudson, will be able to take 20,000 well-trained soldiers and horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military service tasks of the branches of the Koslow family were all transferred to the southeastern province, and all of them were placed on Hudson's head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it was the turn of the southeast province to go to the battlefield, he would not only have to lead the army in the county to join the battle, but also the troops from all branches of the family had to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the different obligations of the provinces, the southeastern provinces are more responsible for providing supplies, and the military service is relatively less. The Koslow family also needs to provide an army of weapons and equipment to compensate the provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the equipment is only provided according to the standard of ordinary troops, and the armor only needs to account for one-tenth of it. If everyone in the elite troops wears armor, the Koslow family really can't get it together for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private army of the family + the private army of the nobles in the county, it is not a problem to gather 20,000 to 30,000 well-trained soldiers and horses. As long as two battles are fought, the survivors are the elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (Note: The Alpha Kingdom counts the number of troops as \"soldiers and horses = soldiers + horses\", and war horses are also included in Dingkou)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many elites following, not only the safety factor will be improved, but the right to speak will also be greatly increased. In important military meetings on the front line, they can also get the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't try to kill yourself, you basically don't have to worry about becoming cannon fodder. The kingdom is not yet so extravagant that it can abandon tens of thousands of elites at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the struggle between the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, Hudson never thought that these big forces would immediately support the northern battlefield. If the human race were so united, the orcs would not dare to take the initiative to start a war with ten courage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if there is a quarrel, the bigger the quarrel, the more valuable the blood moon horn in his hand will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feng Shui took turns, Pius VII knocked a sap in front of the Frankish Kingdom, and now he is ushering in his revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Questioning the legitimacy of the Pope is the first time in the continent of Aslante. It can be said that Pius VII, this wave has also been named through the ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this reputation. Like the Frankish king, damage is inevitable, and it depends on whether it can be made up later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, if the Blood Moon Horn falls into the hands of the Frankish Kingdom, and the Holy See is convicted of colluding with a cult organization, Pius VII will die in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the Holy See, it is absolutely inevitable to win the blood moon horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the high-level officials of the Kingdom to have identified the corner of the Blood Moon as being in the hands of the Holy See, and then blessed the seal with the power of the mysterious compass. Hudson really didn't dare to trade at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is still too poor, otherwise the prudent Hudson would not choose to take a risky trade. Of course, being targeted is also one of the reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was in the Mountain Territory, he had no problems, and no one dared to do anything. But once you go out with a large army, the situation is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the style of the Holy See, the mountain leader can't stop prying eyes. If you keep this hot potato, you will bring disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the reputation of the Holy See, even if it is just a guess, it is enough to make the Holy See take a big action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, it is also involved in the dispute over the Pope's legitimacy, so it is even more inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Blood Moon Horn that Bear Stearns used to hold animal milk, Hudson smiled secretly. If the seal is not released, I am afraid it will be placed in front of everyone, and no one will think that the broken horn is an evil weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the news leaks out, everyone must be willing to believe that this is the \"Blood Moon Horn\". If it cannot be proved that the Blood Moon Horn is in his hands, then it can only be slander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Undead Magister\", this terrifying title, even if Hudson himself stood up and admitted it, the outside world would treat it as a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really thought that undead magic is so easy to practice, and you can just be a magister casually. If there is that kind of talent, it is exactly what the Alpha Kingdom needs most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Necromancers have a bad reputation, but before doing something, everyone is still not interested in chasing them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the mage associations supported by the kingdom, there are many necromancers. It is people, not forces, that are inherently evil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the current frontline, necromancers are most needed. As long as the necromancer makes a move, the corpses infected by the dark forces will no longer be used as rations for the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to sneak into the circle of power, the eighteen generations of Hudson's ancestors have been checked by everyone. The course of birth and growth was all innocent, so she was included in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To say that someone is fake and shoddy, it is an insult to everyone's IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the most basic ability to distinguish, I am afraid that everyone's foundation has long been usurped by people and gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only question now is whether the mysterious organization is the Holy See?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the identity is confirmed, it will be better to blackmail. If it is another big force, this price will definitely be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that only when the Holy See buys the \"Blood Moon Horn\", will it not make a public announcement. Even they are more worried about leaking than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, the Holy See insisted that the \"Blood Moon Horn\" was in the seal. If it was revealed that it was dealing with others, it would be a slap in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way to deal with this kind of shady matter is to quietly erase all traces, rather than publicizing it with great fanfare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Call for the names of the five royal families: Beamon and Lionman are already available, and the other three are undecided. If it has been mentioned before, please remind me that Haiyue only wrote two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This time was different, someone dared to openly question his legitimacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change of power in the Holy See also has a **** side. If we go deep into it, none of the high-level members of the Holy See can escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they just questioned the legitimacy of the pope, but in fact, this wave of Franks brought the entire high-level of the Holy See into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pope is not legal, and the clergy appointed by the pope will naturally have to be redefined. If the window paper is pierced, everyone will die together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is the reaction of the mainland countries?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, his life has not been easy. The Franks questioned the legitimacy of the pope, and they were not empty-handed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the origin of his identity to the process of seizing power, the black history of Pius VII has been \"picked up\" in a large piece.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the high-ranking members of the Holy See with the same interests stand with him, it does not mean that he will have no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal structure of Dawn Church is very complicated. Apart from the vested interest groups in power, there are also many other factions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family's rooted inheritance has added a lot of uncertainty to the power struggle of the Holy See. In the process of seizing, Pius VII also offended many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is naturally impossible for internal struggles to wipe out the hostile factions, otherwise it is not an internal struggle, but a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losers of these power struggles are waiting for opportunities all the time, wanting to make a comeback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the pope's black history was exposed, rumors spread all over the holy mountain, and all kinds of gossip were overwhelming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII, who was good at infighting, knew very well that the Franks could get so much black material about him, it must have been stabbed out by someone inside the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this juncture, he can't do anything about the inside. Any untimely move will be interpreted politically as a guilty conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Internal power disputes can still be suppressed. The external reaction is uncontrollable. If there is an anti-pope wave, Pius VII can only step down in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is impossible for an organization like the church to be divorced from believers. The current Dawn Vatican is far less powerful than it was back then. Most of the believers have the same will, and the Vatican cannot stand firm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is not good. Eighteen countries including Dante Kingdom, Hesse Kingdom, and South Bank Kingdom are all interested in the proposal of the Franks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very likely that they will attack us at the Human Race Alliance meeting in July.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha, the Kingdom of Warhammer, and the Principality of Moxi called on all parties to exercise restraint, but the Kingdom of Alpha proposed that all parties form a joint investigation team to investigate the truth of the incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously they are also full of hostility towards us. If they are not busy with the war with the orcs, I am afraid their reaction will be more positive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Sauron said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have expressed their views are all bad news, and not expressing their views is the greatest support for the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this terrible situation, Bishop Sauron said: It is too difficult to be responsible for handling the relationship between the Holy See and other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of causes must bear fruit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to restore the glory of the Holy See, in the past years, they have offended all those who should offend and those who should not offend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On weekdays, everyone is afraid of the strength and influence of the Holy See, and dare not act rashly, but the situation has changed recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the Alpha Kingdom publicly slapped the Holy See in the face, accusing them of colluding with cults and intending to subvert the kingdom's rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is another wave like this, everyone suddenly realizes that the Holy See is just like that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the sense of fear subsides, the mind to do things will come up. It's a bit embarrassing to challenge the Holy See directly, but everyone is still not afraid to wave the flag and shout after the Franks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Alpha Kingdom, which was violently beaten by the orcs, did not forget to add trouble to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can an \"investigation team\" be formed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A pope who is being investigated by a group, what is the matter. It was obvious that he wanted to pull the face of the Holy See to the ground and rub it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the Holy See can't stand the investigation at all. If they don't investigate, they will be accused of these crimes. If they are investigated, they will be the largest cult organization in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make money and weaken the power of all countries, in the past hundred years, more than half of the cult incidents on the mainland have been related to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many internal disputes among the human race, and there is also the shadow of the Holy See behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is even more serious. If we dig deeper, there may be another charge of colluding with orcs and betraying the interests of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many crimes added together, not to mention that the Pope is going to die, the entire Holy See will have to follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Lord of Dawn comes in person, he probably has to think about whether it is worthwhile to offend all believers in order to keep this bunch of rubbish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ulise, do you have any clues for the Blood Moon Horn?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had enough troubles, if the \"Blood Moon Horn\" also exploded, Pius VII really doubted whether he could withstand the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has lost confidence in the Judgment Knights. Those guys who are full of fighting and killing will only make things worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we can only hope for the \"sacred hand\" with more flexible means and more hidden ways of doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have now tracked down the mountain lord. According to the information collected by intelligence personnel, the mountain lord is likely to be impersonated by a necromancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Its strength is the lowest and a magister, and there is an adult earth bear beside him, and with tens of thousands of troops gathered in the mountain territory, it is almost impossible to succeed by force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people are communicating with him to see if he can be redeemed and bought back. So far, the contact has been smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this person's asking price is too high, our budget is limited, and we can't squeeze out enough funds for a while, you see…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the budget, Ulise didn't even blush when he lied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, compared to the previous performance of the Judgment Knights, the Holy Hand has pushed the matter to this point so quickly, and no one has the time to care so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Very good! Don't worry about the budget. What you have to do now is to get the Blood Moon Horn back to me at all costs. The Holy Library will bear all the expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain lord in question also tried his best to win him over. Burying this nail is also a good thing in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a necromancer, how can he escape the detection of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, this issue must also be clarified. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said with satisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big price, it also depends on who it is for. The Holy See is poor, but compared to the heyday of the year, it is still much richer than a \"necromancer\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the transactions between the strong rarely use gold coins directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either use precious magic materials, or exchange cultivation resources, even trading some knowledge is better than gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the warehouse of the Holy See, there are many treasures and training materials used by necromancers. At this juncture, Pius VII didn't mind trading it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, what satisfies him most is that his own intelligence organization has the handle on the other party's identity, and now he dare not use it. It involves the \"Blood Moon Horn\", and they cannot afford the consequences of exposure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future is not certain. If you are willing to cooperate, you are good friends. If you are not willing to cooperate, find an appropriate time to reveal the identity of the other party, which can also be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the secret can be submerged and replaced without being mastered by the method discovered by the nobles, the value that can be obtained will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of this is based on the confirmation of Ulisse's words. If you know that all this is all guesswork, it will be another scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps he felt that things were going too smoothly, and he was a little worried. Pius VII added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Be careful when trading. The person who released the news has not been found out. Maybe there will be twists and turns in the follow-up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern battlefield, the five royal families of orcs gathered together. Except for the Beamon family who is crown prince Alex, the other families are all visited by the emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shouts of killing that filled Yunxiao did not affect the progress of the meeting, as if the battle outside did not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps due to the chilling atmosphere on the battlefield, the atmosphere in the tent was also slightly tense, and the faces of the several emperors were not very good-looking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The giants, dwarves, and elves who promised to start a war with us...never launched an attack on the human race as agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these races do not participate in the war, with our strength alone, it is almost impossible to shake the dominance of the human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagle Emperor said in a cold tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, he was not optimistic about this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uniting all ethnic groups in the mainland to overthrow the supremacy of the human race sounds wonderful, but it is another matter to execute it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone made an agreement in advance, at the critical moment, the allies who had their own thoughts fell off the chain one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all interests that cause trouble. Jointly overthrowing the human race is a high-risk action, but whether the interests can match the benefits remains to be verified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one overlord of the mainland after all, not every race has the strength to replace the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most races, preservation of strength is the most important thing compared to the unrealistic struggle for hegemony on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs want to make trouble, everyone has 10,000 support in their hearts, but it is another matter to ask everyone to go to the battlefield with weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to respond to the actions of the orcs, all races have not been idle, and have created a lot of friction with the human race a few days ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, friction is just friction. If we want to start a race war, we still have to think twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing can't be blamed on others. During the last continental war, the orcs betrayed all races for their own benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feng Shui takes turns, and this wave is my turn to be fooled, so naturally everyone can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly the elves also participated. The pure elves actually learned to deceive people, which is really beyond the imagination of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had personally participated in the negotiations, the Eagle Emperor would have found that the representatives of the elves had never made a clear promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the representatives participating in the alliance are members of the main combat faction. In order to facilitate this war, the news sent back has been slightly artistically processed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King on the side was very embarrassed. This war was promoted by him alone, and even the alliance of various ethnic groups was also his handwriting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are too many smart people of all races, and they all want to wait for the allies to consume the strength of the human race first, and then jump out to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So that except for the orcs who really came, other races stopped at the last moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor, it's useless to talk about this now. All ethnic groups do not keep their promises, and sooner or later they will pay the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has already started, and the three kingdoms of the human race have launched a full-scale mobilization. It is no longer something we can stop if we want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more times like this, the tougher we have to be. Any weak behavior will intensify the human race, which will cause unpredictable disasters! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you have a thick skin, everything is not a problem. Wars have been fought, and no one will believe me if there is a misunderstanding at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army attacked strongly, and the human nations who wanted to preserve their strength chose to wait and see temporarily. Once they show signs of decadence, there will be absolutely no shortage of participants when they beat the dog in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance is not just a show. If there is a real chance to destroy the orcs, everyone will not show mercy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of dealing with alien races, the overall position of the top leaders of the human race is actually the same. No one wants these guys to revive one day and overturn their own foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor calm down, we need unity even more at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also temporary that all ethnic groups in the mainland choose to wait and see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we make a major breakthrough on the battlefield, they will still be tempted to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's put the matter aside for now, why don't we discuss the upcoming war first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield of the Alpha Kingdom has reached a stalemate, these old opponents know us too well, even if we break through their defense line, there are still countless castles waiting for us...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex bit the bullet and smoothed things over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are four emperors in a meeting of five people, and he is the only one who is still the crown prince. Thinking about it makes me feel aggrieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the four emperors, if this war is won, it will be blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose, you can also take the opportunity to eliminate dissidents and eliminate unstable factors within the imperial court, with the exception of Alex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are some things that the emperor can do, but the crown prince cannot. In case of arousing the fear of the old Beamon Emperor, he, the crown prince, will soon do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of these troubles, Alex wondered if his father did it on purpose, trying to use these troubles to kill him in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Alex's physical condition could not withstand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boost!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, you are still knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a reaction speed, are you going to give the head to the orc? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since realizing that the front line is not good, members of the Koslow family have been unlucky. Ushered in the most rigorous military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Baron Redman is running in the team at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military duty is the unshirkable responsibility of every nobleman!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, the orcs don't care what your status is. The more noble the status, the happier people will kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the survival rate of everyone, Hudson decisively chose the training camp. All clansmen who need to go to the battlefield have enjoyed the treatment of devil training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simple running will naturally not trouble these master knights. But under the gravity field of Bear Stearns, it is very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone seems to be carrying hundreds of catties on their backs, and it is still difficult to walk normally, but it is too embarrassing to run fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The protest was invalid. When Hudson arrived at the training ground, it was a denial of relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Bear Stearns, who is having a good time, is even more unfaithful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One man and one bear, like devils, forcing them to train.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect is also leveraged, leaving the scope of the gravity field, their reaction speed has been greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is still a long way to go from Hudson's request.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In ordinary times, nobles and civilized fights, those with strong realms basically win, but it is different when fighting for life and death on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any unexpected situation will affect both warring parties. It is common for the strong to die at the hands of the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no chance for everyone to experience the experience of life and death, but you can still work hard to improve your body's reaction speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people are the elites of the Koslow family. If they all died on the battlefield, Hudson would not be able to support a family by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the situation of the battle does not go well and the reaction speed is fast, you can follow him to make a strategic transition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as these elites are kept, even if the army in his hand is wiped out, he can pull another team out at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decline of the great aristocrats, the most typical sign is: the population is thin, or the younger generations are all waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no direct descendants, the great nobles who rely entirely on outsiders will soon be hollowed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era of bloodlines, the family is the best bond of interest, far more reliable than various alliances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these people are not all loyal to Hudson, in terms of loyalty, they are generally higher than outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing and tossing until everyone was tired and lying down, Hudson stopped to wipe his sweat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although nourished by the power of the mysterious compass, his physique is much stronger than ordinary people, but he will still be tired after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' Gravity Domain is good at everything, the only shortcoming is the indiscriminate attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone who received the training was uncomfortable, and the instructors who received the same treatment from Hudson were not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, this kind of training is too intensive, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Baron Redman finished speaking, Hudson interrupted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, don't worry, I, like you, are moving in the field of gravity, and I am very aware of how much your body consumes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you eat more nutritious items, you can still make up for the body's consumption. You don't have to worry about the expenses, it's actually not much to share with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On average, there are only two or three gold coins per day, which can enhance the survivability on the battlefield. Such a good thing can't be found outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, this level of training is also good for everyone's cultivation. I can clearly feel that the speed of life seeds has increased by nearly 20% recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially you knights who are stuck in the bottleneck, if you persist for a while, you may break through the current state. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said flicking to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether this kind of training can break through the realm, only the Lord of Dawn knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, what he has to do is to convince these people that the current training can not only enhance their life-saving ability, but also improve their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the strength has not improved, it must be that the training has not worked hard. Anyway, with so many people present, Hudson couldn't believe that there weren't many breakthroughs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is a role model born, this trick of drawing cakes and training Dafa can continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The perfect answer, Baron Redman swallowed all his words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a knight, the temptation to improve his cultivation is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is fooling the knight officers, and later it will be extended to the whole army, and it will also fool the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The theoretical basis must be perfected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 165": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 165: big fool\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 165 Big Fudge\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats are training hard, let alone ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite private army of each branch has gathered at this moment. All of them were wearing heavy armor, practicing the formation with great effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has high hopes for this heavy infantry. In case of confrontation with the orc elite, only rely on these elites to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there are far more than these two thousand hoplites in the Mountain Territory. There are also some strong soldiers who were also selected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the physical reaction speed of these soldiers is not as fast as these fighters who have practiced fighting qi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with ordinary orc soldiers can kill all directions, but it will be embarrassing when encountering elite orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the main defensive side, there is nothing wrong with building a tortoise shell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for mobility, Hudson has no chance to consider it for the time being. According to past experience, the main task of these southern border nobles sent to the front line is to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the initiative to attack, that is the job of the kingdom's standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This arrangement is obviously a full consideration of the uneven combat effectiveness of the noble private army, which is not suitable for field battles with the elite orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply defending the city, the use of heavy infantry is naturally not great. But once a certain city wall is broken, these elites are the only ones who want to plug the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the battlefield is fickle. No one can guarantee whether there will be an encounter with the orc army in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a single heavy infantry holding the formation, maybe the enemy's elite will charge and the formation will be pierced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the heavy cavalry, of course there must be one. A horse with the blood of a monster can fully withstand the power brought by the armor, and the speed of movement is not greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that it is too expensive. That's all for armor. The mountain collar can produce it by itself, and the cost is barely affordable, but there is no way to produce war horses by itself, so they have to be purchased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the war, high-quality horses were out of stock. Many noble lords, including Hudson, are waiting eagerly for the war horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to solve this problem, the high-level officials of the kingdom are busy communicating with their neighbors. It is estimated that a large number of war horses will pour in before long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price, we won't know until then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is officially sold by various countries, there may be a discount for the need to fight against the orcs; if it is delivered by a non-governmental organization, it can only go with the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This account is easy to calculate. If the Three Kingdoms in the north can't hold on, it means that they have to lead their troops to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And the speed must be fast, a little slower, and the flames of war will burn to your own home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is in power, he will also provide material support at this time, so that the neighbors can block the knife in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the economy can afford it, the more heavy cavalry with certain mobility, the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain high mobility, it is best to increase the number of horses equipped. Vaguely, Hudson had a flash of inspiration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that when I was playing alchemy before, I accidentally created a super \"cow\" and was sent to be a breeding bull.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by powerful genes, newborn calves are far superior to other calves in terms of physical strength and endurance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One-year-old calves can catch up with ordinary adult cattle when plowing the land. The speed of land reclamation in the mountainous territories has greatly increased, and these cattle also contributed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be copied to the horse, his heavy cavalry may run faster than the light cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the spirit of science requiring the courage to experiment, Hudson plunged into the laboratory, tinkering with the alchemy career he had given up on earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is different from before is that he has supplemented a lot of basic knowledge in the field of alchemy these days. The contributor of this knowledge is naturally the fiancée.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, according to the unspoken rules of the Alpha Kingdom, the nobles must prepare for the war with all their strength, and everyone tacitly chose to stop all marriage activities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are these activities gone, but even the daily banquet activities have been put on hold indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The euphemism is to prepare for war with all your strength, but the real situation is that you don't have a lot of money in your pocket. No one knows how long the war will last, and the whole kingdom is tightening their belts to live a hard life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when entertaining guests, everyone tacitly lowers the level now. If you can save, you can save, and the saved materials can be used to support the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being able to get married, many things are still inconvenient. Even if this knowledge is the default dowry of both parties, they can only act in a low-key manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In return, Hudson also provided a lot of good iron to the Holliser family. Although neither party stated it explicitly, the basic principle of equivalent exchange is still vividly reflected in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are minor issues. What really made the two families marry was because of this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many benefits involved, in-law relationship is still the lowest cost and the best effect among many alliances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family needs to purchase supplies, as well as some war technologies, such as: various armor manufacturing technologies, war equipment manufacturing technologies...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family only obtained some good iron on the surface, but actually bought an insurance for the personal safety of Viscount Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camps of the southeastern province, the camps of the two camps can completely move together. If you encounter a force majeure failure and you have to run away, Hudson's value will be reflected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family does not lack strong men, and Viscount Oran also has someone to protect him. But the problem is that their luck is not very good, and what they get is a turtle-like monster mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When fighting with others, it is an advantage to bear a turtle shell. When running and evacuating, the speed of these turtle-like monsters was not as fast as that of strong humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult for a strong man to escape, but if he wants to run away with a person, it depends on luck. In case the strong enemy intercepts, it can only be cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of speed, Bear Stearns is on the loose. Even the Griffon cavalry flying in the sky can't catch up with the bear's butt. Even if you bring a few more people, the speed will not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a chance to take someone away, so there is no reason not to bring your own father-in-law. These things don't need to be said explicitly at all, everyone knows it in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for joining forces against the Dalton family, that was after the war. If the balance is not broken, then everyone will be well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one party suffers serious damage, then it is logical to play within the rules of the game and cede part of the benefits in exchange for a loose development space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the conflicts between the first family and the second family in the province, in fact, the two families are related to each other, and they are relatives who have married many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is derived from interests. Internally, we are competitors; externally, we have become allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened in the aristocratic circle boiled down to an infighting among a group of relatives. This is true at the top, it is true at the middle, and it is still the same at the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, Miss Isabel is here. This time she is bringing a mysterious old man with her, and she looks very difficult to mess with!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson rolled his eyes directly at the hint of the old butler winking. It seems that this misunderstanding is not explained clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the old man's grandparents have been with his family for generations, and he was brought up with him, and his loyalty is full, Hudson would have changed a long time ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is the lack of talents. The younger generation is still in the process of training. Before their temperament is completely smoothed out, they are not suitable for such an important position as a housekeeper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can only comfort himself: Butler, in fact, you don't need to be too smart, the key is to have high loyalty and be able to properly handle things in the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring them over here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smile on the corner of his mouth has already revealed his thoughts. The opportunity to blackmail has come, but you can't let it go easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson picked up the sleeping cub, rubbed the miniature bear's head and said, \"Dear Mr. Bear Stearns, please help me determine the strength of the person coming.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said \"respect\", but in actual actions, Hudson has never respected him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treating a face-saving bear, in order to make Bear Stearns work hard, Hudson didn't mind a few words of flattery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns opened his eyes and yawned, then Bear Stearns said casually: \"It's just those strangers, there's no need to look at them, they're all rubbish!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if they are dealing with you, they should be able to slap you to death. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    not angry!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One cannot be angry with a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just disturbing Xiong Qingmeng, as for such revenge? Actually satirizing the great Lord Hudson, even worse than rubbish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson suddenly noticed something was wrong. It is absolutely impossible for the mysterious organization to send over to make a deal with the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A palm can slap himself to death, but the Silver Knight will definitely not be able to do it. Hudson can at least resist a few moves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that the person who comes, the worst strength is the Golden Knight, or the Earth Knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling such people garbage, Hudson vaguely has a preliminary concept of Bear Stearns' strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get a better understanding, Hudson pretended to be angry and asked: \"Since they are all rubbish, can our Mr. Bear Stearns kill them with one paw?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cub who broke free from Hudson's palm patted the bear's paw and said falteringly: \"Except for the old guy who is approaching, everyone can be dealt with with a slap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that guy only has three claws at most!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oh, at most five claws...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the deflated Bear Stearns, Hudson smiled slightly. If it can be done, it means that the problem is not big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't care about the specific number of claws. This is a mountain territory, as long as one's own safety is guaranteed, no matter how powerful the visitor is, he has to stay in peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Beautiful Miss Isabel, I haven't seen you for a long time, but you are very haggard. Could it be that you miss me so much that you can't sleep at night?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After teasing Isabel, without giving her a chance to answer, Hudson suddenly changed his tone: \"I don't know what's your name, old man?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is obviously not in line with the character design, it instantly disrupts the thinking of the two of them. After regaining her senses, Isabel stared fiercely, but she still consciously gave the old man the chance to speak first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old Kevin, I met Viscount Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He spoke politely, but his body was very honest, and he didn't even have the intention of moving, let alone saluting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told Hudson that the person in front of him must be the Lord in a high position. No matter how much you hide your identity, you can't hide the aura emanating from your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Kevin, since you are here in person, you can talk about business if you want. This is the list my friend wants. You can complete it according to the above requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind it is a magic contract, which stipulates their respective obligations. Once the transaction is concluded, the matter is over. In the future, everyone will face the sky, each walking on one side. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Haggling, how can the great Hudson do such an unforced thing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really thought he was a pervert, and he still had the kung fu to flirt with women before the business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the purpose of establishing the image of a necromancer with a \"quirky personality\" and bringing people into the pit in the future, he wouldn't have such leisure time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a magic contract, which can theoretically guarantee that the other party will not leak the secret. But a theory is a theory after all. Hudson himself can use the mysterious compass to break off the shackles of the contract. Who can guarantee that the other party can't do it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case things come to light in the future, the extra title of \"Necromancer\" is the best way for him to clear his suspicions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fake things are fake after all, no matter how you test them, they can't become real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention undead magic, as long as Hudson is willing, he can test the talent of magic idiots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things mixed together, as long as one of them proves to be a lie, then the others can also become a lie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to turn black and white on a powerful nobleman, you also have to ask the kingdom if it agrees. When it comes to the core interests of the aristocratic group, there is no need to worry about no one supporting it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whose vest the mysterious organization is, Hudson's blame is all ready-made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the southeastern province, no one knows that Master Hudson's first pot of gold came from killing the cavalry of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See retaliated, deliberately spread rumors, and slandered his image as Lord Hudson, and he was full of sympathy in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules in the aristocratic circle are like this, it doesn't matter what you say, the key depends on what you do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kill the people of the Holy See, and everyone will default to the hostile forces of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is to stage a bitter trick, the fledgling Hudson with an uncertain future is not worth hundreds of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the nobles of the kingdom, they all believed that the people of the Holy See killed the king's special envoy and seized the \"Blood Moon Horn\", which formed a closed loop for this set of rhetoric.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What everyone thinks must be true. Even if it turns out to be false, it will become true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the list, the old man's expression changed slightly. The lion opened his mouth wide, he had already prepared in his heart, but the problem was that what Hudson wanted was too messy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A necromancer of yours, asking for a large number of magic crystals, a full set of magic spells, magic circles, alchemy knowledge...all of these make sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what the **** are the sea charts, shipbuilding technology, magic crystal cannon casting technology...?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it's because of dealing with the undead every day, the brain is polluted and stupid, and I really want to live the addiction of the lord, Kevin can understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What made him speechless the most was that Hudson not only asked him to sign the contract, but also at least five land knights or magisters to sign together to ensure the authenticity of the information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too cautious. Although the items on the list are valuable, most of them can be copied, and they are not unique skills of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Holy See, it doesn't hurt at all if one more family or one less family has the power to master this knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really needs pain is the 200,000 magic crystals and 5,000 magic cores of different specifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most painful supplies were taken out. Is it worth abandoning him, a knight of the earth, just to fabricate false information?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really think that the strong are Chinese cabbages and can be easily discarded. For any power, the strong are the most precious wishes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same necromancer with a brain hole, bargaining?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin felt that he was not crazy enough to do such crazy things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on past experience, necromancers are no different from ordinary people when they are normal. Once crazy, no one knows what they want to do in the next moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some guys who have studied too much and made their own brains stupid, they are purely untimely bombs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, with the \"Blood Moon Horn\" card, it can also be worth the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he doesn't need to pay for these expenses, so it's not worth risking his life to save money for the holy library.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the risk of coming over to discuss business with the necromancer, you can't work in vain. Deep down in his heart, Kevin has even begun to secretly calculate how many private goods to add to the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter to Kevin whether the Hudson in front of him is an original product or a Necromancer pretending to be one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, from seeing the quotation list, Hudson must be a \"dead magister\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, it should be \"Grand Magister of the Undead\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stronger the strength, the stronger the right to speak. It is also reasonable to ask for more supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    -Perfect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chen Xi's Vatican's family has a great career, so why not get rich together?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something else is found out, how can this transaction continue? The Holy See also has principles, and is not willing to pay a big price to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being able to pay a big price means that they, the dealers, have no way to make huge profits from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps some treasures that practice undead magic must also be added. Although he can't use it himself, it doesn't mean he can't sell it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an intelligence organization under the command of the Holy See, the \"Holy Hand\" is able to complete the task very well every time, relying on this flexibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Knights of Judgment is a negative teaching material. They played rough things when they first came up, but they couldn't find the Blood Moon Horn, and they made themselves ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, I don't know the Horn of the Blood Moon, can you let me take a look first?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite for the conclusion of the transaction is that the \"Blood Moon Horn\" is in the Mountain Territory. Otherwise, there is no way to continue this wave of money-making plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, lend your horn toy to this old gentleman.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it was implying that Bear Stearns had been keeping a close eye on him, and if there was any change, he would just shoot him to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mediocre horn fell into Kevin's hands. The appearance is indeed similar to the \"Blood Moon Horn\", but the temperament is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eerie resentment was gone, replaced by a thick milky smell mixed with honey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, is this a joke?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan to make a fortune is important, but the prerequisite is to be able to fool the past. The counterfeit product in front of him is simply a milk bottle shaped like a horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Kevin, don't rush to get angry. I just used a little trick to seal the breath of the horn.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson waved his hand. The blood moon horn, which was originally mediocre, suddenly became resentful, and it would be scary to take it away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's right, that's what it feels like!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin, who was still worried at first, smiled instantly. If something is true, then everything is negotiable. Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no problem with things, happy cooperation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I have a personal question. If you want to develop your territory, you should lack a lot of funds. Why don't you ask for gold coins? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson secretly rolled his eyes. If he could ask for money, would he not ask for it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The financial situation of the Mountain Territory is no secret to the big forces. There is a sudden influx of large sums of money, and everyone knows there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, magic crystals and magic cores can directly charge the mysterious compass without leaving any traces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those things within knowledge are better solved. The information is directly copied into the \"photograph stone\", and it is only a few insignificant stones that are traded, which will not attract attention at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait until the war is over before taking it out for use. Hudson can shamelessly announce that these are trophies snatched from the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how the orcs obtained these things, the only way to investigate is to go to the orc empire. Based on the conflict between the two races, it is estimated that there is a high probability that people will become barbecues in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Kevin misunderstood, for those of us who pursue the true meaning of magic, the development of the territory is just a cloud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life is too short. It is better to use your limited life to improve your strength than to waste your limited life on these foreign objects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the right way to strive to break through the sanctuary as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just a contract of intent means nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Requiring many experts of the Holy See to sign the contract as a guarantee is not only to worry about the breach of the contract by the other party, but also to prevent the black hands hidden behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through the last conversation with Isabel, Hudson knew that the \"Blood Moon Horn\" was leaked in the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The man behind the scenes has not been found out so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the front foot is traded and the back foot is robbed, Hudson can't escape the suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling the Blood Moon Horn can be regarded as taking what they need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone spends a lot of money but doesn't bring things back, then they will be missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being targeted by a powerful force hiding in the dark is definitely not a fun thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson now just wants to throw out the hot potato of \"Blood Moon Horn\", but he doesn't want to fight with a big force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending off the envoy amiably, Hudson's mind has already arrived on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the frontline defenders was much more tenacious than he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few battles with heavy losses, but in the end they persisted until reinforcements arrived and held the last line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a lot of bad news, for example: the private army of the aristocrats of the Fengyun Province who arrived at the front line first and garrisoned suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a gossip: one-third of the losses on the front line were contributed by the nobles and private soldiers of Fengyun Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Proper fighting is not good, and the technique of sending heads is top-notch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical negative teaching materials, not active when preparing for the war, now is the time to pay the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also performing garrison missions, the performance of noble private troops in other provinces is much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss is heavy and cannot be avoided. But everyone's casualty rate is still under control overall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a negative case, Hudson also used the nobles of Fengyun Province as propaganda, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether this will offend the nobles in Fengyun Province, there is no need to worry at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only been three months since the half-year garrison time, and there is still half of the time left, and they don't know how they will survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the garrison mission is completed, there may not be many nobles who can come down from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them were injured, and they were busy going home to lick their wounds and regain their vitality. It was too late to prepare for the next call. How could they care about Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar negative publicity is not just Hudson doing it in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to urge the people below to strengthen training, the governors and county guards in almost all places did not forget to step on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While busy with training, he also has to pay attention to the development of the territory, Hudson is also very tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is that after the expansion of the mining area, the food crisis in the territory has also passed smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The operation is nothing new, it is nothing more than a latte and exchange of food with the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After these people obtained the iron, whether they forged weapons for their own use, or whether they used weapons and armor to rush to the kingdom's mission was not in the scope of Hudson's concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In times of crisis, the nobles' response ability is still good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Led by the Dalton family, the first batch of supplies purchased from overseas has arrived in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, I haven't disembarked yet, and I will be sent to the front line soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor's Office repeated orders to quell prices, but in the end they couldn't hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the war, prices are still inevitably soaring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food prices have skyrocketed by 80%, daily necessities by 50%, and some special commodities have even doubled directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The merchants who hoarded their money made a fortune, but unfortunately, before they had time to settle their pockets, they were killed by the Governor's Mansion to make an example of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Severe strikes cannot stop the stimulation of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the supply of materials is still sufficient, there are too many excuses to inflate prices for huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The self-sufficient nobles and gentlemen will not be greatly affected, but the free people will be miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rising prices are not just a problem in the southeastern provinces. None of the three northern countries caught in the flames of war escaped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, I just received news that a group of war horses from the Warren Chamber of Commerce will arrive in the Southeast Province soon.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the old housekeeper made Hudson look refreshed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of cold weapons, war horses are really important. Even as the defender of the city, no one would dislike their own mobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the establishment of the army of the Alpha Kingdom, the ration standard for war horses is on par with that of the knight master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war broke out, the price of war horses also rose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A high-quality war horse can often be sold for tens or even hundreds of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an ordinary war horse, it is impossible to take it without a dozen gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high price is just a pain in the ass, and out of stock is the most unsolvable problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If supply exceeds demand, there will be excess profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warren Chamber of Commerce, as one of the four major chambers of commerce in the mainland, is also a logical thing to get involved in this kind of business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you know how many war horses the Warren Chamber of Commerce shipped over this time, and where are they delivered?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many merchants engaged in the horse trade business, but most merchants sell only a few or a dozen war horses at a time, and those with hundreds of horses are considered big merchants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the largest seller of iron products in the southeast, the Mountain Territory has always had close ties with merchants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war broke out, through the previous business network, Hudson also successively obtained hundreds of war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want more, you can't help it. Nobles everywhere are snapping up. No one will let go of things that enhance the ability to save lives on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many competitors. If there are too few horses delivered, it is estimated that they will be snapped up before Hudson sends people over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is said that there are more than 3,000 horses. The Warren Chamber of Commerce is preparing to auction them in Beida City, but no reservations are accepted.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson lost interest in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only 3,000 war horses, and they are still sold at auction, clearly wanting to make a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competing for financial resources, he is not the opponent of the old nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson complained about those veteran nobles more than once. Knowing that war may break out, why not raise more war horses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this can only be thought about. The early warning of the orc invasion is rehearsed almost every few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the moment of the real outbreak, no one knows when the war will break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you reserve in advance, you can only keep a large number of war horses all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War horses are pure consumables, and the money and food consumed for daily feeding alone are higher than maintaining the same number of standing infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the wealthy nobles, who can keep thousands of war horses all the time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning of the business, Hudson could not afford to raise only 20 or 30 war horses, so he could only sell them for cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the pressure to go to the battlefield, Hudson would not purchase a large number of horses even now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, he, the Viscount, is now commanding tens of thousands of troops, and it is not too much to have a thousand-man cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these soldiers are all pieced together by everyone, and he only has temporary command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry is too expensive. Even forming a small cavalry regiment with hundreds of people will put a lot of pressure on the mountain leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, remember to remind me to attend.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether there is a chance, you have to try it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money of the veteran nobles did not fall from the sky, and no one wanted to be taken advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than fight to the death, it is better to secretly collude and carve up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Connect them in series, maybe you can get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having spent two or three years in the aristocratic circle, I have never even seen an auction. It is a tragedy to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Dardir City, an old man lay lazily in front of the grocery store, bathed in the afterglow of spring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, your business vision is really not very good. You don't choose from so many places in Dadir City, but choose such a remote shop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This shop has been in operation for more than three months, and the number of customers who come to buy things every day is not as many as our shop!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business continues as you do, and we will have to move again soon. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl complained helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She has absolutely no hope for her own business. Business at home has never been better for as long as I can remember.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in her heart, she has decided that her grandfather is not suitable for business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The products in the store are quite satisfactory, they are some fast-selling daily necessities, and some of them are in short supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It stands to reason that as long as the price is reasonable, no customers will come to your door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't stand the remote location of the store.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not far away is a military camp, and there are no residents nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect the conscripted serf soldiers to have any purchasing power. Maybe people don't know what money looks like from birth to now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't blame me, who knew that the orcs would suddenly invade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    伱Go to the city to see, is there any shop that is doing well now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is gritting their teeth to support. Although the passenger flow here is small, the rent cost is also low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I bet, among the big and small shops in the city, our losses are definitely the smallest! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man forcibly quibbled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losses of others are all temporary losses; they are different, they have been losing money since their opening until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smell of gunpowder filled the air, and the aristocratic gentlemen in Wright County were all busy training soldiers and horses, so they had no time to spend at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The free people in the city are mainly businessmen like them, and the source of customers is extremely limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because Viscount Sith considered the long-term development and did not rush to collect war taxes, otherwise everyone would run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whee…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grandpa, you are blushing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Admit it, everyone knows you didn't get rich anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about we also sell horses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the war horses of the Alpha Kingdom are the best sellers, and they are quickly sold out as soon as they are shipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard that many businessmen have switched to selling horses now, and all of them make a lot of money...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl had a flash of inspiration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man just rolled his eyes. If it is for making money, it is definitely a good business to sell horses now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being unable to tell the winner in the Northern Xinjiang battlefield means that the price of war horses will rise for a long time, and the profits will inevitably be extremely rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think he is also a big boss. Although his status is not visible, his pockets are very big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Guna. How many times have I told you that hot business can't be touched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You only see how much the horse dealers earn, but you know how much risk they take.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the bandits and bandits along the way. How can the business of noble gentlemen be easy to do, if the price negotiation collapses, maybe it will...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man made a movement of wiping his neck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all of this has no deterrent effect on Guna.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is dangerous, it is also dangerous for others. After so many years of running around, anyone who came to trouble them ended up dying in an ugly way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weird elf does not mean no mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years wandering in the mainland, I have never seen anyone stronger than her grandfather, but my grandfather is a coward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the conversation, a burly middle-aged man came to the door of the store. It was rare for business to come to the door, and the old man hurriedly greeted the waiter to receive him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You're welcome, tell your boss to come out, I have a big deal to talk to him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The icy voice makes one's scalp tingle after hearing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"here we go again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna muttered to herself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar \"big deals\" will appear on time when their business cannot continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on these \"big businesses\" that emerged from unknown cracks in the rocks, the old man's business that has been losing money has been successfully maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm the boss, what do you want sir?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"By the way, this is not a place to talk, sir follow me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna, what are you still doing in a daze, quickly take out my treasured tea leaves and entertain distinguished guests! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he led the middle-aged man into the guest room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need for entertaining. When discussing business, I don't like being disturbed by others.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna has heard the same old words more than a dozen times. I've been bored for a long time, so if it's inconvenient to disturb, just tell her not to eavesdrop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Professed to be a businessman, you can't stand up to customers. Guna stomped her feet secretly, then turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The owners all avoided, and the shop assistants even left early. I am afraid that the poor reception will annoy the big customers and ruin the business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that no one was eavesdropping, the old man's aura changed, and he asked:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Come here to look for me at this time. Could it be that the investigation has come to fruition?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Connectors are also particular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an underground organization, it has not been taken care of by anyone, and it is all due to the well-done covert work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, people from the Holy See have found the mountain leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal security of the mountain territory is too strict, and we cannot infiltrate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What exactly happened is still unknown for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what is certain is that there was no conflict between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most noteworthy is a singer named Isabel, who is an intelligence officer developed by the Holy See and has contacted Viscount Hudson many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that there is still an affair between the two. Perhaps there was no conflict between the two parties, and it had something to do with her. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged man replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tracking work is not easy to do, especially in heavily guarded places like mountainous areas, which limits their room for display.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson is not a simple character, and he will never give up the horn of the blood moon for a woman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no conflict between the two parties, either the things are not in the mountain territory; or the two parties have reached a secret deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to stare at the mountain leader. If a deal is reached, he will never give up this opportunity to rip off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transportation of bulk materials will definitely leave clues...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came to a normal level, the old man suddenly realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with the Holy See at this juncture is already full of risks. If you engage in bulk material transactions, wouldn't it be intentional to let interested people find out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of stupid thing will definitely not be done by a shrewd \"Generation Generation\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the great reputation of the Blood Moon Horn, it is directly valued in gold coins, and there are not hundreds of carriages to pull it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a massive cash transfer, it is impossible not to leak the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The essence of the transaction is equivalent exchange, as long as the value is about the same, there is no need to use gold coins foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See has a rich family background, so it is completely possible to trade some valuable treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As far as Hudson knows, only a part of the Cavaliers played last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knights\" and \"Cavalry\" seem to have only one word difference, but in essence they are very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former represents glory, and no one is qualified to be named without dazzling achievements; the latter is a pure organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There can be multiple cavalry regiments in the knight order, the most famous of which is of course the Holy See's Knights of Judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not only cavalry formations for running on the ground, but also cavalry formations for flying in the sky, which is short of swimming in water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Crimson Knights do not have an established air force, they are still the kings in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trading in such a heavily guarded place, Hudson is very relieved. In case the mysterious organization dispatched a ruthless character, he would sneak into the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid accidents on the road, Hudson not only brought his five hundred elites, but also invited the nobles of the county to participate in the auction together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A team of thousands of people set off from Wright County. Those who know clearly that this is to participate in the auction, but those who don't know may think that it is to go to war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a lineup like this, sneak attacks do not exist, all you can do is attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does not think that the mysterious organization has the ability to mobilize thousands of elites in the Alpha Kingdom to lay an ambush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no army available, only a few masters want to attack this team. If you don't prepare a few forbidden spells, I'm afraid it won't work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the front line, you can see that the war was so fierce that neither side used forbidden spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't have the ability to use forbidden spells, it's that the price/performance ratio of this thing is too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without five or six magisters of the same department, or a team of magicians, it cannot be released at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After letting it out all at once, the mages almost sucked up the rest, and it took a while to recuperate before they could shoot again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coverage of the forbidden spell depends entirely on the strength of the caster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically, it can be infinitely large. In fact, the coverage of most forbidden spells is very limited. Expanding the magic range will weaken the power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forbidden curses recorded in history to destroy cities can be read as stories, and they are completely irrelevant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the human race does not have a sanctuary now, including the pope with the blessing of the artifact, which can only be regarded as a false sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of external force, the strength of the strong in the sanctuary can be exploded, but once it is used, it will be fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII was obviously the one who spared his life. He has been on the throne for so many years, but he has never personally acted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation among the foreign races is similar. The elf queen, who is known as the number one master in the mainland, is only suspected of being in the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly, even if there are masters of this level, the number is absolutely impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the strongest in the sanctuary do not have the ability to destroy a city instantly. The possibility of artistic processing of those great figures who destroyed the world in legends is too great, and they are obviously not representative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mighty advance of the team made the scalps of the spies in charge of monitoring tingle. With so many nobles and lords dispatched together, one must be careful from a distance, isn't close-range investigation fatal?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how difficult the task is, it will be completed. If you can't get close, then it will be estimated. For this kind of investigation mission, a little bit of error is justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the target has already appeared. It is expected to arrive in Beda City tomorrow afternoon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the target is very vigilant and takes a large group of people to act together. Judging from the information collected, there are more than 1,500 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And all of them are elite, many of whom are knights. The communication of the target is very broad, and nobles continue to join the team along the way, and the specific number of people changes at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to rob and kill, unless a few adults do it yourself, there is no chance of winning. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shadow Killer said in a deep voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long-term training made him lose the feelings of a normal person, and he became more like a cold machine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because an intelligence officer like him who is almost a dead man can be rational does not mean that the intelligence personnel below can also disregard their own gains and losses, and an ambiguous intelligence appears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goal is to guarantee a minimum of 1,500 people, and there is no upper limit, which makes things awkward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw Kevin waved his hand and said calmly: \"Okay, don't think about these uncertain things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now our mission is to bring back the Horn of the Blood Moon, everything else is trivial. There is no need to take risks for a little profit, if it affects the mission, it will be troublesome. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affecting the task is one aspect, and affecting the fortune is also a big problem. If the Blood Moon Horn is snatched back, how can I reap the benefits?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the credit is a little bigger, how much can it be increased. In the minds of the Holy See's senior officials, as long as the Blood Moon Horn is brought back, it is a great achievement, and any means are the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of thing, as long as the senior officials know about it. In front of the pious believers who work below, it is still necessary to perform a performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Kevin turned his head and told Isabel in the corner: \"Miss Isabel, for the next transaction, you will come forward to negotiate with Viscount Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to create a little scandal to attract the attention of the outside world as a cover for this transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few of us will pretend to be your guards and follow behind. Everything in the box is yours from now on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rainbow Moon, we've got you covered. When it is done, you are a free man! Shadow Killer will hand over the reward promised to you earlier. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, sir!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel said with a little excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The whole person trembled, as if he was too excited. It's just that deep down, it's a different scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trembling of the body is an instinctive reaction, but it is not the excitement of being free, but the shock of being frightened by the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been with Divas for many years, Isabel is not just a novice, she is best at observing words and expressions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From Kevin's seemingly kind expression, she felt something unusual, as if she was looking at a dead person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many people present are direct descendants of the mysterious organization, but she is the only peripheral member, and a peripheral member who is about to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing such secret news, letting her go like this is obviously not in line with the usual style of mysterious organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too late to regret. Who told her that when she was young and ignorant, when she joined the mysterious organization, she had a cooperative attitude and made an agreement with others not to stop her when she left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the \"Blood Moon Horn\", unstable elements must not be allowed to stay. Even if this **** is valuable, the Holy See will not take any risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Holy See, the \"Skull and Bones\" camp on the other side is much poorer. Looking at the few masters around him, the masked man began to hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an aspiring Skeleton Lord, he doesn't want to lose all his wealth for an uncertain adventure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The people of the Holy See are in Beda City, Viscount Hudson also ran over at this time, and took a large team to act together. The possibility of a deal between the two parties is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With our strength, we do not have the strength to stop this transaction. Now the plan needs to be changed, and all the previously deployed actions are cancelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we will use the power of the noble group to find a suitable time to reveal the identity of the Holy See and his party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that they colluded with the orcs and came here with the horn of the blood moon, intending to set off a rebellion in Beda City and disrupt the rear of the Alpha Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plans are not changing fast. Originally, they wanted to stir up a conflict between the two parties, so as to benefit the fisherman, but they did not expect that they would reach a deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After working on the plan for more than half a year, it turned into a farce. It's like the new house I prepared, but let someone else enter the bridal chamber.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man couldn't swallow the gas in his belly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trading place happened to be in Beida City, a restricted area where he wanted to do something but didn't dare to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have no choice, you can only kill someone with a borrowed knife. Now he only expects the nobles in the southeast province to do more to keep all the people from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Horn of the Blood Moon, falling into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom is far better than returning to the hands of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a fanatic who is determined to restore the glory of the Lord of Dawn, he has never been tired of exposing the dark history of the Holy See and damaging the prestige of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the series of evidence presented by the Frankish Kingdom questioning the legitimacy of the Pope, there is the selfless contribution of the masked man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, our identities are not visible, and we cannot contact the Governor's Mansion. At most, we can only release rumors to attract the attention of those nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just in this way, it is easy to startle the snake. If people from the Holy See find out, then...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the middle-aged man could finish speaking, the masked man interrupted: \"Karliss, your mind hasn't changed yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What time is it now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs invaded, and any news about the orcs would cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Holy See colluded with the orcs to set off a rebellion in Beida City, such a shocking event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether something is true or not, as long as they receive news, those nobles who are afraid of death will send someone to investigate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Write a few more secret letters, find a few people on the street, and deliver them to the relevant noble officials. As long as one person's attention is attracted, the goal is achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think that the identities of those guys from the Holy See can stand the investigation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the identity of the people in the Holy See is revealed, the transaction will be over. In order to get rid of himself, the Viscount Hudson had to make trouble for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the blood moon horn is 100% to be pushed down on these people in the Holy See. The crime of colluding with the orcs, he would probably have done it for the Holy See. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beida City, the much-anticipated auction kicked off in the anticipation of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The allure of war horses is huge. All nobles with some strength in the province sent representatives to participate, and some even appeared in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the Warren Chamber of Commerce, there are other merchants coming to join in the fun. The number of war horses to be auctioned has also increased from the initial three thousand to four thousand three hundred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there has been a lot of increase, and the situation of too many monks and too little food has not changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know how many war horses other forces want to buy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the more the better for himself, even if it is to wrap up these thousands of horses, it can be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the number is huge, but in fact there are many branches of the Koslow family below, and the younger brothers in the county also have needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small nobles do not need to build professional cavalry, but a small amount of cavalry is still necessary to explore horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For your own safety, it is also necessary to arm a few trusted cavalry guards and charge along with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that it is not a big deal for a family to share ten and eight war horses, but when close to two hundred noble families come to share, this number will soon inflate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competition started directly, and the price had to be skyrocketed. How can a smart nobleman let merchants handle it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning of the auction, a group of powerful factions discussed the ownership of the war horse. The auction still needs to be staged, but the price must be within everyone's control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this still takes into account the subsequent impact. Otherwise, instead of discussing how to buy it now, it would be a direct grab.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a powerful faction in the southeast province, Hudson was lucky enough to get an independent box without having to squeeze in the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, there is a beautiful lady outside who claims to be your close friend. She came here specially to talk about it. Do you see?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soft voice of the maid pulled Hudson back who was familiar with the rules of the auction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"close friend\", in other words lover. But the question is when did he find a lover, it was obviously slander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go down, I will chat with Viscount Hudson alone!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could speak, a voice came from outside. The soldiers who were supposed to intercept had already moved out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid who was waiting on the side even more quickly dodged. Judging by the degree of familiarity, it is obvious that similar scenes have been encountered many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After casting a blank glance at the charming Isabel, Hudson has already made up his mind to teach this woman a lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was a different occasion, and it was delivered secretly, he really didn't mind having an extra lover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But playing like this at the auction, don't you know that Mr. Hudson's father-in-law is also participating in this auction?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are already engaged, everyone will not regret it because of such a trivial matter, but after all, it will not look good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no rush to turn his face, it is because there are a few more boxes in the room. With his keen perception, Hudson knew that it contained magic spar and magic core.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The contract is here, let the people behind you sign it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a parchment flew out of Hudson's hand. It is the contract document prepared before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make this document, he has suffered a lot. Finally, with the help of the mysterious compass, the contract drawing was completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the effect, you can only know by trying it. At least it looks more compelling than ordinary magic contracts, like high-end goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this case, the \"Guard\" is obviously not suitable for staying for a long time. After a few strong men put their bets on the contract, only Hudson and Isabel were left in the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaintly, Hudson felt that someone was peeping, and the cub on his shoulder stretched out his paws in cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Being targeted!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Hudson was not polite, and hugged Isabel into his arms, as if an old lover met and was tender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the magic spar and magic core in the box disappeared completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a \"whoosh\", the photo stone also entered the hands of Bear Stearns. At the same time, the sealed Blood Moon Horn was also quietly sent out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several \"guards\" who got the things used the excuse of needing to excrete, asked the maid outside the door for directions, and then left the scene with an excuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At about the same time, people who were similar to the previous guards replaced the previous guards and appeared outside the box to guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reaction speed was so fast that if Hudson hadn't told Bear Stearns to pay attention, he wouldn't have noticed that someone had changed outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, can you let go.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel said slightly with a flushed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's hands were restless just now, and what tossed her was upset. He was obviously very angry, but he still didn't dare to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment the deal was concluded, she was abandoned by the mysterious organization. If she hadn't been needed here to attract attention and cover the smooth progress of the transaction, perhaps she would have been dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let go, hold my lover, why let go?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people consider themselves lovers, don't they want to repent now and treat me as a bully! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson's slap had already been slapped down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene made the faces of the two old men who were hiding and watching from the opposite side very embarrassed. Spying on people and flirting is not what they should do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yuli, are you sure the opposite party is colluding with the Holy See and the orcs to plot a rebellion, rather than a young couple flirting?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is young, and it's okay to make a little mistake. A capable nobleman doesn't have a few romantic affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When this kind of thing is revealed, the faces of the Koslow family and the Holliser family are not good, and they do not conform to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel's beautiful name is Yuanbo, and since she entered Beida City, she has attracted the attention of countless noble children. Even the kid in my family clamored for me to propose marriage for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mostly, someone was jealous and made up the news deliberately, with the intention of framing. In order to use our hands to destroy this pair of bottom lovers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What a big deal, why bother to be this villain? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Antar Magister said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter who Isabel harms, as long as it's not his kid. He can't afford to lose face by marrying a singer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hooking up with Hudson now can just stop his son's delusion, and he can also put an end to something in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the report that Hudson colluded with the orcs and the Holy See conspired to rebel, Antal never believed it from beginning to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not proper for a good nobleman to go and get mixed up with these two families, wouldn't it be crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the orcs are awesome now, humans will win in the end. As for the Holy See, let alone, if the accusation of colluding with the orcs is true, civil strife will first break out within the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because the top management has no morals, doesn't mean the people below have no morals either. At the very least, the group of ascetic monks representing the highest combat power cannot tolerate the betrayal of the interests of the human race by the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Antal's view, even if the orcs colluded with the Holy See, they would only do so secretly. Involving Hudson in it was completely funny, as if he was afraid that the news would not be leaked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How do I know, anyway, you have read the secret letter. You must be careful when encountering anything at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't they also report a few people in the Holy See? It will be clear when they are found out. By the way, there are a few boxes that went in together, you can send someone to check it out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magister Yuli said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last time Hudson made him feel ashamed, I thought Yuli was so active because he caught him this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, the dog food was sprinkled as soon as it came up. If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, he would have suspected that the idiot opposite him would be able to show them on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you want to investigate, you can do it yourself, and I will not accompany you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a popular singer, she should have some savings. Unless you can find the Horn of the Blood Moon to prove that the contents of the letter are true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it has no meaning except to offend people. If you are not afraid of making enemies and revenge on your children and grandchildren in the future, then go ahead! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Antal turned and left directly, leaving Magister Yuli in a dilemma, and finally could only sigh helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong are also human beings. They are not afraid of offending others, but they have to consider the younger generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is necessary, normal people are unwilling to offend people to death for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught a romantic affair, if this can be counted as a handle, more than half of the nobles in the world have similar handles left outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone dies together, it can only be called \"Merry\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it happened before marriage, it was a little too much, but if the cover is lifted, the Holliser family, who is the victim, will definitely not appreciate him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unknowingly escaped a storm unintentionally, Hudson is still taking revenge. What surprised him was that he had clearly given the opportunity halfway, and Isabel in front of him was not in a hurry to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, you stare at the door from time to time, what are you afraid of?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the mysterious organization thinks you know too much and is in the way, wanting to kill you? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Isabel's astonished expression, Hudson called out from the bottom of his heart: Damn it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This **** plot was actually staged in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder he would rather be taken advantage of by him than leave in a hurry. Feelings are to avoid chasing and killing, so I have to stay here for refuge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    was exposed, Isabel did not continue to cover up, but asked suspiciously: \"You are not a necromancer, so what happened last time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just because I have a fiancée and I can't marry you, it is too vicious to try to slander my reputation just because I have a fiancée.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson held Isabel's chin with one hand, full of warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Isabel was dumbfounded. Such a shameless throwing away the pot clearly shows that he doesn't intend to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Love breeds hatred\", this is to let her bear all the notoriety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this statement is in line with mainstream thinking. On one side is a well-matched aristocratic fiancée, and on the other side is a beautiful singer, which one to choose is self-evident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deny?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See wants to silence her, but this seemingly lecherous guy in front of him may not necessarily want her to leave alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't directly attack, probably out of reputation considerations. Aristocrats can be passionate, but nobles cannot be ruthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the \"lover\" around him can be killed at will, not only will it make the followers feel insecure, but even the Holliser family will doubt whether this marriage is correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are blindly obedient, and many things cannot be avoided. Hudson and Isabel have been in contact so many times, and everyone has long believed that there is a lover relationship between them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Your Excellency, Viscount. My mind is a little confused, can you let me go first. You can easily make me stupid!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson is acting, she can only cooperate. Her intuition told her that whether she could escape unscathed depended on the next conversation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, what you said is insincere. You are obviously lying in my arms, how can you beat me back?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I need an explanation, an explanation that can make up for my damaged reputation. If my fiancée finds out, she will be upset. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson's hands became more and more aggressive. Tell Isabel with practical actions that if he continues to flirt, he will not be polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles will only make judgments based on their own integrity. A beautiful woman came to the door several times, and if Hudson said he didn't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid what people think is definitely not that \"Master Hudson\" has a high moral character, but to suspect whether he is not healthy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of loss cannot be eaten for free, and if you can't wash yourself off, then you can only make true rumors and enjoy a good fortune first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel, who is used to all kinds of routines and knows men very well, has already secretly complained at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This guy in front of him is really too sensible. Mingming's eyes are full of desire for her, but he still doesn't forget to take the initiative, as if he wants to play with her in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are all acting in front of you?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel asked in a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, Bingxue is really smart, and found the problem so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, today's loopholes are indeed too obvious. The guards let you in without any hindrance, and if you think about it for a while, you know there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the people from the mysterious organization have left with their things, and I have also received the traded items. Everyone is getting what they need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only hidden danger is you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be afraid, I am a person who loves fragrance and loves jade, and I still can't do it with a delicate beauty in my arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just for your safety, you will not be able to leave for a long time to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know that Miss Isabel is strong, and she definitely doesn't want to be idle. Why don't you show some value and let me see...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Isabel rolled her beautiful eyes, leaned directly against Hudson, and whispered in his ear: \"I'm already like this, what else do you want?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have limited knowledge about the mysterious organization. Tell you all, and there won't be anything substantial.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talent show, I'm afraid that before the performance is over, some people will not be able to bear the beast. Neither will other people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the truth. What the diva group seems to learn is talent, but in fact it is a means to deal with men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, now, Hudson is a bit overwhelmed by the **** scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After spending so long in a mysterious organization, I should learn something. For example: How to collect intelligence and train intelligence personnel?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it doesn't matter if you don't. Take out your means of serving others, my lord, I...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through speaking, Isabel's tears fell watery, and she lay on Hudson's neck and cried non-stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Professional acting skills let Hudson understand that the woman in front of him is not so easy to conquer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to embrace a beautiful woman by taking advantage of the void. It is not so difficult to want her to work hard. Being abandoned by a mysterious organization made Isabel wary of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he came out of that kind of place, and he is used to the scene of exchanging his body for survival resources. Now he would rather be taken advantage of by Hudson than get involved in new disturbances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson had already expected this scene. If he could be subdued easily, he would wonder if it was an undercover agent sent by a mysterious organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The adverse effects have already been caused, and the only thing we can do now is to follow the trend and reduce the effects as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the outside world thinks it is, then it is good. As long as there is no new big news, a mere affair will be quickly forgotten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Isabel's ability is not needed, then keep it as a vase to show his master Hudson's charm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talk about feelings, that is to bring shame on yourself. For a woman to be able to thrive in the Diva Group, her heart is already dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only trouble is that the fiancée needs to explain, but this problem is also easy to handle. As an aristocratic young lady, it is definitely not uncommon to see this kind of thing, and her inner ability to bear it will not be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gossip with the same diva is better than getting involved with other noble ladies. No matter how beautiful a diva is, the threshold of status cannot be crossed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opening of the auction disintegrated the eclectic atmosphere in the room. Looking at the lively melon-eating bears, he was lost in thought at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of bears, there is no such scene. When you meet a female bear you like, just go up to mate and it's over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him left Bear Stearns at a loss. With Xiong Sheng's experience, he can't understand the relationship between the two at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in order to attract more people to participate, the war horses were not sold in a package, but were auctioned in groups of one hundred horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This made the big bosses who secretly agreed to divide the horses very upset. After the dismantling, the little nobles also had the capital to bid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it will be a little difficult for a family to buy a hundred war horses, but when a few relatives and friends get together, it will not be a problem in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As more people participate, the price will naturally go up. After tentatively quoting a price of 1,500 gold coins, Hudson became a spectator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the price of the first group of war horses exceeded 2,000 gold coins, the number of people participating in the auction suddenly decreased a lot. In the end, it was sold at a sky-high price of 2,800 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's face gradually turned ugly, this price exceeded the market price. The cost-effectiveness of buying a war horse at such a high price is really too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he made a fortune from the mysterious organization, it still couldn't change the fact that he was poor. Instead of taking out a lot of gold coins to snap up war horses, it is better to go back and train infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching group after group of war horses being looted, Hudson knew that the previous agreement was void.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the people in the box, the little nobles below are the majority. Because the demand is small, it can afford a higher premium.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a family purchases ten and eight war horses, even if the premium is 50%, it will only increase one hundred and eighty gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson can't do it. If there is a shortage of thousands of horses, if all the horses are purchased at a premium, the excess budget will be an astronomical figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did Hudson not make a move, almost all the nobles in the box did not participate in the competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war horses fell into the hands of the small nobles of the counties, which also enhanced everyone's survivability on the battlefield. There is no need to compete with younger brothers to be a big brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the price is too expensive, and the strong financial resources are slowly accumulated by the ancestors, and the prodigal family is not allowed to toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the auction of the war horse, the atmosphere of the venue was also pushed to a climax. The sky-high transaction figures kept stimulating Hudson's nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder these businessmen like to hold auctions. If it was sold outside, without so many potential customers competing for it, these war horses would definitely not be able to sell at such a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you build an auction house, you can earn money from the handling fee alone...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, Hudson discovered that this profitable business had nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why so many people attended the auction is because this is Beida City. As the capital of the Southeast Province, it has the strongest purchasing power in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put it in the corner of the mountain, who is full and wants to go to the backcountry to trade?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The next auction item is our finale today, a magical wand—the soul of the water moon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that it was created by the number one alchemist in the mainland, Master Kempey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an eighth-level magic core inlaid on it, and it is also equipped with an energy replenishment device. As long as the magic power in the magic core is not exhausted all at once, it can be replenished with magic spar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When releasing water magic, it can reduce the consumption of magic power by 30%, and increase the original power by 20%, except for forbidden spells!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The minimum starting price is 8,000 gold coins, and each increase should not be less than 500 gold coins. Bidding starts now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The auctioneer's words instantly detonated the audience. A magic wand that reduces the consumption of magic power by 30% and increases its power by 20% is rare to see on weekdays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever has such a treasure in their hands will keep it for their own people. Even if it is not used now, there will always be someone who will use it in future generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was most likely because of the war that it ended up in the auction. A certain nobleman who treasured this object couldn't afford it financially, so he could only reluctantly part with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ten thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson raised his card without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a magician, it is really unreasonable not to participate in the competition when encountering such a high-grade magic wand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a bit tasteless to Hudson. But it is still very good to take out as a gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His fiancée is a water magician. Although it is used by a junior magician, it is pure waste. Who made Hudson feel wronged?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if this kind of gift is given out, it will still be brought back in the future. The meat is in the pot after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Twelve thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thirteen thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price went up slowly, and soon broke through the 20,000 mark, but it still didn't stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"20,500 gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Twenty-five thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising the card again, the price was increased by 4,500 gold coins at one time, which was already a low price in Hudson's heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To spend so much money, just for the Pomeranians to smile. Deep down in his heart, he couldn't help secretly complaining that he was crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it's not just Hudson who is crazy. The family with the water magician is the real madness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thirty-five thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this number came out, countless people on the field gasped. A one-time price increase of 10,000 gold coins is clearly inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The distinguished guest in the third box is offering 35,000 gold coins, is there a higher price?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the work of Master Kempey. Not only the power of the magic wand itself is valuable, but also the production method of the wand is of high research and collection value. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The auctioneer tried hard to encourage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, what everyone values ​​now is the practical value. As for researching the collection value, it is completely dispensable for a magic wand at this price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thirty-five thousand gold coins once!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hammer of the auctioneer sounded, and Hudson had become a spectator. If there is a water magician in his family, maybe he will fight hard, let's forget it now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thirty-six thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The distinguished guest in the second box, the price is 36,000 gold coins, and there are even higher...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forty thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle became more and more bloody. Watching the nobles in the box increase their prices wildly, Hudson suspected that his offer was not gold coins, but copper coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It rushed all the way up, and finally sold at a sky-high price of 83,000 gold coins. Seeing Hudson shouted: incredible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Hudson quickly accepted the reality. The price of magic weapons has never been lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This \"Soul of Water Moon\" magic wand can reduce the consumption of magic power by 30% and increase the output of magic power by 20%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Water-type magister takes this thing to the battlefield, and it is not a dream to fight two against one. If you play a sneak attack, you might be able to stun the enemy all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is equivalent to adding the combat power of an extra magister out of thin air, and it can still be passed on. Is 83,000 gold coins still expensive?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there are not many water system magisters in the southeastern province, otherwise this battle will probably be even more cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is brought to the imperial capital for auction, it is possible to rush up to 100,000 gold coins. For some veteran aristocrats who have accumulated a lot of money, maybe gold coins are really just a number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the climax, everyone's enthusiasm for the next auction dropped a lot. Several items in a row failed to sell for a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also took the opportunity to buy two excellent elf bows. As the famous \"Bow Knight\", it is really unreasonable not to prepare a few good bows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of elf bows that flowed out was not many, but it was not too small. It's not a magic weapon, and it doesn't have a magic power bonus. Everyone's enthusiasm for fighting for it is not high, and Hudson is cheaper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Now the second finale item of the auction is rightly these two beautiful elf ladies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many pure-blood moon elves in the entire continent. Take it out, it will definitely save face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the employer wanted to split the auction, but the two elf ladies were unwilling to separate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The employer is a great knight, and he is unwilling to do such a difficult thing. So this pair of fairy sisters put them up for auction together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The starting price is 5,000 gold coins, and each increase should not be less than 300 gold coins. The auction is now open. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the auctioneer said, Hudson almost sprayed Isabel with a mouthful of water. Slave traders can also be related to chivalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know where this auctioneer is the best from the Dalton family, but he is so shameless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, a thick skin is also a necessary quality for hosting an auction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the quality of the auction item, it must be blown out in order to be able to sell for a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Five thousand three hundred gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Five thousand six hundred gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Six thousand gold coins!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching a crowd of boxes constantly vying for cards, Hudson directly watched the excitement. The pair of elves and beauties on the stage were indeed beautiful, but this was not enough to make him join the bidding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson noticed something was wrong. The soul of the water moon appeared in the southeastern province, and it may be a collection brought out by the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world is easy to sell at a high price, and the outside world is also very dangerous. Ordinary nobles simply don't have the ability to bring home large amounts of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the flowers of the elf sisters are different, and they can't be sold at a good price in the southeastern province. The fighting on the front line is so fierce, even if you have money in your pocket, you can't squander it casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the active participation of the nobles, just look at the speed of the price increase. Everyone has no intention of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you buy it, the probability of taking it home and enjoying it for yourself is not high. Either take it out as a gift, or take it out to make a deal with others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, it is simply impossible to sell at a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A shrewd slave trader cannot fail to see this. But it still has to be sold in the southeast province. Isn't this a problem with money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 169": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 169: fiancée is not easy to mess with\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 169 Fiancee is not easy to mess with\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, after the price exceeded 10,000 yuan, the nobles stopped asking for prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The beauty of the elves, coupled with their innate aura close to nature, has always been popular in the slave market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Short supply often means huge profits. Ordinary elf slaves can be sold for thousands of gold coins, and high-quality goods can be as high as thousands of gold coins. It is not uncommon for tens of thousands of gold coins to be sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Huge profits gave birth to the prosperity of the slavery industry. There are countless slave hunting teams that go deep into the elf forest every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the elf kingdom is cracking down hard, it still can't stop the greedy people. No matter how strict the precautions are, there will be omissions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the slave-hunting teams never returned, but some slave-hunting teams succeeded in the end. Every year, there will be dozens to hundreds of elf slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there are a lot of them, but they are distributed throughout the entire continent of Aslante, and they become cherished all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With their unique temperament, elves almost meet the aesthetics of all intelligent races except Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't just humans who participated in the slave hunt, other races also contributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the elves have a good cultivation talent, coupled with a long lifespan, there are endless strong people in the clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the unique terrain of the elf forest, this blocked the peeping of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moon elves are relatively rare, and this pair of sisters is also stunning. A premium of 10,000 gold coins is still at the bottom line of everyone's heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was before the outbreak of war, the price could be increased by at least three to five thousand gold coins. Now everyone is tightening their belts to live, without the usual arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price was lower than expected, and the auctioneer was sweating profusely. Even if the customer refused to bid, there was nothing he could do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't deliberately arrange for someone to raise the price, right? If such a scandal really happened, the reputation of the auction house would be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who participated in the auction are not soft persimmons. They can kill people with swords when they make a rush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many aristocrats are involved, no matter how tough the backstage is, they can only admit defeat when they are wronged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere was not adjusted, and everyone's enthusiasm for the next auction was not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone always thinks twice before making an offer. Once most items approach the market price, no one will increase the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a melon eater, Hudson doesn't care about the transaction price of commodities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sluggish transaction price seems to be due to emotions, but in fact it is caused by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the auction, you will know that the final transaction price is not low for anything related to war or that can improve personal strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those that cannot be sold at a high price are basically luxury goods that have been highly praised in the past, and there have even been unsold auctions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the auctioneer is trying hard to shout, it is still futile to face a group of customers who are tightening their belts and spending rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The last auction item is a mysterious treasure map. According to the owner who sold the treasure map, the location recorded in the treasure map is a secret vault left by the Guangming Empire for the restoration of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to protect everyone's interests, we have identified the age of the treasure map. The treasure map has a history of at least 350 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows what the Bright Empire means. It is conceivable how valuable the treasures left by an empire to restore the country are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rumors about the treasure are also recorded in the history books. I don't think anyone would have made a fake treasure map to joke with us more than 300 years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this auction, there is no minimum starting price, and there is no limit to the amount of increase. The auction starts now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the auctioneer's voice fell, the hall erupted, and all the guests started discussing the treasure map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Treasure Map\" is almost a necessary way for travelers to make a fortune. Hudson is also extremely hot-eyed. It is just a treasure map that is difficult to distinguish between true and false, and it is really difficult for him to fight for it desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the treasure map is real, it does not mean that the treasure is still there. Putting it on Hudson, he didn't mind taking the treasure first and then selling the treasure map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the treasure is not taken out, it can only prove that the place where the treasure is buried is too dangerous, or the so-called treasure is a trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal people don't set up traps randomly, which doesn't mean that cult organizations don't either. Maybe the so-called treasure is an altar for evil gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the nobles below fight for it, Hudson silently mourned for them. Trying to get rich overnight through treasure hunting is not much more likely than playing the lottery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did Hudson not make a move, but all the nobles in the box did not participate in the treasure map competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits and risks are equal. In troubled times, the precarious little nobles can choose to gamble, but the old nobles with big families and big businesses cannot gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is cruel. Even if the treasure is real, it will be difficult for everyone to achieve a class transition again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a middle-class nobleman to a great nobleman, it seems that there is only one step away, but the threshold of this last step goes straight into the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not because of ability, let alone hard work, but because of illusory luck that we can cross over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the cake was made bigger, the upper layer had already been filled with radishes and pits. New radishes want to grow, unless the previous radish is pulled out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the existing rule system, unless the big nobles themselves have problems, or are cold on the battlefield, the latecomers will have no chance at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir, Viscount Oran invites you to the dinner tonight.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What should come will eventually come, but this efficiency is too high. As soon as the auction ended, the old man sent out invitations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood! Tell the person, I will be there on time tonight.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't hide, you can only face it. Whether a romantic affair is big or small, in the final analysis it is a matter of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, his father-in-law also has many lovers outside, and even has a few illegitimate children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is the same, no one is much higher than the other. The only problem is that the standards are different. The requirements for the son-in-law and the requirements for oneself must not be the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats inevitably pay attention to their cards and often go to Beda City for activities. Hudson also inevitably goes to the countryside to do as the Romans do, buying real estate in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the sky-high prices in the capital, the housing prices in Beida are much more harmonious. A house covering an area of ​​nearly three acres is less than a quarter of the price of the two elf sisters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mysterious organizations do things in a grand manner. Even the carriages that transported the boxes were left outside, directly benefiting Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, nominally, these carriages, coachmen, and several empty boxes that conceal people's ears belong to Isabel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of outsiders, this is Isabel bringing all her wealth to join Hudson. People and wealth gain both, a typical winner in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the envious eyes of everyone, Hudson and Isabel got into the carriage together, just like a pair of loving lovers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he is being targeted, he has to perform a full set of acting, and any omissions will bring unnecessary trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The carriage moved forward slowly, and there was an old man with a suspicious appearance in the crowd, but his face was extremely ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After painstakingly arranging for so long, the report letters were flying all over the sky, but nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, the old man had already greeted the whole family of the bureaucrats in the Governor's Mansion. It's too dereliction of duty, so many big things can be treated as if nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the convoy moving forward slowly, the old man quickly turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you can't do anything, you should get out of here immediately.\" This is the main reason why he has been able to live freely in the mainland for so many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hurriedly out of Beda City, several members of the Skull and Bones who followed the old man had very ugly faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of my own Holy Master is really too \"stable\". Nothing happened, and he fled out of the city as if desperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, what happened just now, why...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the young man finished speaking, the old man reprimanded: \"Idiots! Everything has been exposed, and you don't even know it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the officials of the Governor's Mansion did not take any action. Have you not noticed any abnormalities?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the gang of aristocratic gentlemen who reported this kind of report have always been wrongly caught and never let go, how could they stand still! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitating for a while, the old man reviewed himself again: \"I underestimated the enemy in this matter, and it involved a viscount with real power, how could it be handled the same as usual!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are all from the same road, and they must treat their own people differently. Maybe our letter has just been delivered, and someone else will receive the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    is laying out a big net, waiting for us to throw ourselves into the net. If I hadn't reacted fast enough, when someone else found it, you wouldn't be able to run away even if you wanted to. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man still had some lingering fears. It seemed that he was glad that he reacted decisively and did not fall into the enemy's plot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The members of the Skull and Bones Society behind them were also very frightened at the moment. They didn't know if they didn't analyze it. After this analysis, they realized that the world of nobles was too dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just mentioning the Viscount Hudson incidentally, he almost got himself killed, which directly refreshed everyone's perception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Master, people from the Holy See entered the auction house and never came out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those guards seemed to be about the same size, but they were actually replaced halfway through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them were mercenaries recruited temporarily. Could it be that they completed the deal and left over the wall with their things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel, who stayed behind, was only in charge of covering up for them in order to deceive others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis on the side exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is mixed in the Holy See, and he still has some understanding of some of the Holy See's habits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Involving the \"Blood Moon Horn\", this special mission must be to achieve the goal and use any means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to complete the task and send out a singer is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"brain supplement\" is the most terrifying, almost guessing the truth, but unfortunately their reaction is still a step late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few hours passed back and forth. For a master, such a long time has already been hundreds of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is air power to respond, maybe everyone has left the southeastern province by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't even know the direction the enemy is leaving, and even if you want to pursue them, you don't know where to pursue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Said it was an invitation to a dinner party, but Hudson didn't wait for the night to pass. As the sun began to set, Hudson's carriage appeared at Viscount Oran's house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the shabby little house in Hudson, this place is undoubtedly much more luxurious, covering an area of ​​only seventy or eighty acres.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The houses of nobles occupy a large area, which is also a feature of the Aslant continent. In almost every city, most of the land is the mansion of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a \"family member\", Hudson was still warmly welcomed by his servants. It can be seen that they are all professionally trained, and they are very clear about their duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the layout of the house, it can be seen that there is no sign of a banquet tonight. Inviting him over is likely to be a private banquet or a family banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host, Viscount Oran, has not appeared for a long time, and Hudson can't help feeling a little flustered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interpretation is impossible. He didn't dare to expose the transaction with the mysterious organization at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, Hudson didn't even track down the origin of the mysterious organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if deep down in his heart, he believes that the mysterious organization is the vest of the Holy See, Hudson is still a mysterious organization, and he is determined not to have anything to do with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon Horn\" does not exist, let alone transactions. Some are just him and Isabel falling in love at first sight and developing a relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now this is the truth, no matter who digs, it must stay at this step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this deal was given too much. Leaving aside those priceless knowledge, the value of the magic spar and magic core alone is as high as millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things cannot be bought even with money. It is not unacceptable to sacrifice your reputation for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stealing fish\" was caught by the old man, it is impossible to be honest. Just thinking of the bunch of illegitimate children of Viscount Oran, Hudson's hanging heart slowly fell again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, if you get scolded, just pretend you didn't hear it. Such a small matter has not yet reached the point of retiring the engagement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Melissa, why are you here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came out, Hudson regretted it. A typical proposition is to cheat yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is my home, why can't I be here! Could it be that I appeared at the wrong time and disturbed some people's romance...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Melissa could finish speaking, Hudson rushed up to gag her, and hugged her in his arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, to be reasonable, something big will definitely happen. Simply let it be presumptuous for a while, let's go through this hurdle first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"let me go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just struggling to finish speaking, Hudson kissed him again. The weak little magician couldn't break free at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original intrigue gradually turned into flirting. The servants in the room retreated silently. They should not be involved in such matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, if you do this again, I will call someone.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The anger is still there, but compared to the previous indifference, a little change has taken place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Call it! I've already set up a magic barrier, so you won't be able to hear your voice no matter how you shout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone sees it, with our relationship, who will come over and cause trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a magical sound-proof magic barrier enveloped the two of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa, who was originally aggressive, was instantly dumbfounded. A pair of big eyes stared at Hudson, as if saying: I am very angry, this matter will never end with you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all of this has almost zero lethality on Hudson. He was not polite at the moment, and directly checked the body for his fiancée.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop, don't mess around here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a trace of panic flashed in Melissa's eyes. After all, she is a young girl, how could she have seen this battle. Lest Hudson go one step further and directly put her here...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson stopped decisively. It's okay to pretend, but if you really play, big things will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the living room, and someone may come over at any time. Taking advantage, flirting, no one will say anything, if Viscount Oran goes further, he will have to go crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shall I go to your room?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa said in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, she no longer cared about trying to settle accounts with Hudson, but was thinking about how to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having a relationship with your fiancé before marriage is also considered indecent in the aristocratic world. Such a reputation has a bad influence on both parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that Hudson's reputation for flirtatiousness has already spread, and there is no hope of recovering it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When did you come back, why didn't you notify me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson changed his concerned face again. The process is not important, let's solve the immediate trouble first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a cold drink, the recovered Melissa couldn't help mocking: \"Some people promised me when they were in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, he was given to the mansion. If I come back later, can I attend your wedding? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wedding\" does not exist. If you dare to get a singer to get started, it is estimated that the Koslow family will get the fryer first. Maybe Baron Redman will hold a whip and find Hudson to settle accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that the younger brothers will also switch sides. Everyone knows that following an unreliable boss has no future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A mere diva, how can she compare with you? She delivered it to her door by herself, can I be blamed for that?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for an accident, some people would have passed through the door earlier, how could these things happen now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson held Melissa in his arms again, and continued to walk around her with his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong, Melissa hurriedly pushed away and said, \"Don't mess around, father is still waiting for you in the study, don't make him wait.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting this answer, Hudson looked at the blushing Melissa, and burst out laughing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the two of them were going to have a conflict, he asked his daughter to come over to interrogate him. The father-in-law was probably not prepared to let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But considering that the flag of the Viscount Oran's house did not fall, and the colorful flags were flying outside, there was nothing wrong with it, maybe he really didn't take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood! But someone still needs to prepare. If you go out in this appearance, I'm afraid everyone will think I did something to you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smirk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that if he really messed up, there was a high probability that he would succeed today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether he will be hunted down by Viscount Oran afterwards, it is hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an exciting thing, Hudson thinks it is better not to try it. Even if you want to steal the forbidden fruit, you have to change the place, and it can't happen under the nose of your father-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to try inviting Melissa over?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, Hudson decisively killed it. There is still a singer in the family who has not been dealt with, so it is not a Shura field to let the fiancee go there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you Taoist Qing Jin, leader of South Street Liquor! Jia Geng owes first, and arranges later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    IOU: On September 23, 2022, Haiyue owes readers 2 chapters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even so, they barely held the line of defense with the help of reinforcements from the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Participating in the first round of the battle, he was beaten so badly. There is no doubt that all the nobles in Fengyun Province must have suffered bad luck this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no miracle, many noble families will inevitably decline or even perish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old neighbor, it is also necessary to help care and express condolences, and there is absolutely no other meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is difficult!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the frontline battlefield, anything can happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Hudson, are you ready for the challenge? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Viscount Oran who expressed his feelings, Hudson really wanted to reply - no!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war preparation work has been carried out so far, and it seems to have achieved initial results. In fact, everyone knows that this is still far from enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The all-out war launched by the orcs has never been a wave. The Alpha Kingdom has reinforcements, and the Orc Empire also has reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the orcs will not stop unless they consume all the tribes in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a race disappears from the Orc Empire because of the war, don't be surprised, this is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe in a few years, the disappeared race will reappear. In the interracial promiscuous orc empire, not to mention that new races are born every day, but some races must be added every month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These races usually come and go in a hurry. Most of the rare races came to this world in a daze, and left the world in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War at this level is a competition for the comprehensive strength of both sides, which cannot be changed by the efforts of one or two nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well prepared they are, they will only be an insignificant member on the battlefield, at most affecting local wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can have no confidence in your heart, but you must be confident in your mouth. Every outstanding nobleman is a qualified king with a strong mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everything is unfolding step by step. If there is no accident in the middle, I will bring at least 20,000 elite soldiers to the battlefield when I join the battle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-spirited voice, as if he already has 20,000 elites, ready to go to war at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the entire private army of the Koslow family, plus the private army of all the nobles in the county, could not gather 10,000 elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Twenty thousand elites are not a small number. I just want to get through this war and gain something. I'm afraid it's still not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from the front-line army, the total number of casualties in the noble private army in Fengyun Province has exceeded 70,000, and the number of casualties alone is 30,000, among which more than 1,000 noble children were killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an exaggeration to say that the family of Fengyun Province contributed half of the casualties on the front line. It is said that in order to treat the wounded, many chaplains accompanying the army were tired and collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had no way out and no way to surrender, they would have collapsed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the consequence of poor preparation! But as long as they put their heart and soul into training, this situation will not happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poor Liufeng family, meeting an arrogant patriarch, this time I am afraid it will be ruined!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the Fengyun Province have also been tricked by this guy. With so many nobles dead, this account is bound to be settled with them after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liufeng family, which has been passed down for thousands of years, is afraid that this time it will be completely devastated, and the inheritance may even be cut off directly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intelligence is Hudson's shortcoming. Even if he wants to send people to the front line, he can't get ahead in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just ordinary noble officers, that is complete cannon fodder. Don't say that he passed the information from the front line back in time, and he was lucky if he didn't die on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Able to obtain detailed casualty battle reports, it is clear that the children of the Holliser family placed on the front line have a high status in the army, and may even be in a core position in the headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran is now talking about the Liufeng family, and he may feel the sorrow of the rabbit dead and the fox in his heart, but there is a high probability that he will not be so kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the map, you can see that the west of Qiaomu County is Fengyun Province. Something happened to a good neighbor, and it is necessary to care about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, such opportunities are rare. It is not only the Liufeng family that is unlucky, all the nobles in the Fengyun Province have been trapped in a wave, and they are bound to fall into a period of weakness after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is dominated by the Dalton family, and there is no room for the Holliser family to go further. It is understandable to cast their eyes on their neighbors who are doomed to decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a powerful existence among the middle-level nobles, as long as there is not too much loss in the war, the Holliser family has a high probability of success if they want to take over Fengyun Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for Hudson to worry about how to operate. After all, his ancestors were also great nobles, so he didn't believe that Viscount Oran didn't know the rules of the upper-level political game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has little interest in the planning of the Holliser family. No matter how the Fengyun province changes, it will not be his turn to take a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even ignoring the geographical difficulties, the Koslow family is unable to expand in Fengyun Province. Of course, there is still hope for just planning a knight collar or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just meaningless, any territory in peacetime is precious. It was different during the war, when unclaimed territories were born almost every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to sighing, Hudson only has admiration. I have seen a prodigal, but I have never seen such a prodigal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this battle, the head of the Liufeng family had a high reputation in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As among the feudal nobles, there are few families that can obtain the title of duke. The Liufeng family has always been the mainstay of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Oran, but has there been an accident on the front line? Under normal circumstances, as the defender of the city, the loss of noble officers should not be so great!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing tens of thousands of soldiers so quickly, he felt that the contemporary Duke Liu Feng was a \"talent\". Changing a pig to command, as the defender of the city, may not cause such heavy casualties all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did the soldiers suffer heavy losses, but even noble officers lost thousands of people at once. This is not just a matter of \"talent\", it is clearly a \"genius\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Besides taking the initiative to attack out of proportion and being caught and beaten by the elite orc troops, can you think of a way to lose so many troops in a short period of time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said with a look of contempt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom does not advocate taking the initiative to attack. It is not impossible to take the initiative, but the premise is that you must win, and the worst is a tie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Windy Duke is obviously a negative example. I don't know which nerve is wrong, but he actually led the troops out of the city to play field battles with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Liufeng family is powerful. After being defeated, they managed to hold the line of defense with a group of provincial nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, without waiting for the internal reckoning of the nobles after the war, the kingdom will now hold him accountable for the unauthorized attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Viscount, the nobles of Fengyun Province didn't dissuade them, and just looked at Duke Liufeng as confused?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, everyone should be very resistant to this kind of order to voluntarily die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the southeast province is left behind, if the governor dares to issue such an order to send him to death, he can only attack with his cronies, and the rest of the nobles will not ignore him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Administrative leadership cannot change the fact that the feudal nobles are all independent princes. Even the governor of a province has limited restrictions on the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obeying orders is established within the scope of the rules, and it cannot damage everyone's core interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military order of \"send to death\" is obviously beyond the scope of everyone's tolerance, so it belongs to \"random order\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's \"random order\" may be dismissed down below, not to mention the \"random order\" of a governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation in Fengyun Province is different from our southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, the Liufeng family has expanded rapidly, occupying more than 40% of the land in the province. Most of the county guards are from the Liufeng family, and it is purely the only one in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this battle, Duke Liufeng performed very well. In terms of personal prestige, it is far above our Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the county guards in various places are his cronies, and in Fengyun Province, they almost have everything they say. Even if other people found a problem, they didn't dare to confront him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to take the initiative to attack, Duke Liufeng is not completely messing around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall quality of the army in Fengyun Province is not good, but there are still many elites among them. Under normal circumstances, encountering an army of orcs shouldn't be so miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that their luck was very bad. They encountered a Beamon army as soon as they solved the army of a ratman tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they have an advantage in military strength, they cannot make up for the gap in strength. Facing the Beamon Legion with over 10,000 troops, the coalition forces of the nobles in Fengyun Province soon suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, I know that your military ability is good, but you must always keep in mind the lessons learned from the blood of the Liufeng family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extraordinary as a last resort, don't go head-to-head with the Beamon Legion. Even the most elite troops in the Kingdom would have to muster several times the strength of the Behemoth Army before they dared to fight them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Beamon clan has a limited number of people, and the chances of encountering their main force are small, otherwise the war would not be able to go on at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Viscount Oran who was still in fear, Hudson instantly let go of his hanging heart. It's good to know how to be in awe, but to be afraid is to be afraid of the kind of people who are obviously not good enough, but still think they are awesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom does not allow unauthorized attacks, perhaps it was also forced out by this kind of nobleman who thinks he is awesome. A Duke of Liufeng has deceived Fengyun Province. If there are more, the Alpha Kingdom will be left alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Viscount, Fengyun Province has suffered such a heavy loss, so the achievements should not be small?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't hold out much hope, he still hoped that a miracle would happen. If the Behemoth Legion can be severely damaged, it will not be a loss for the entire kingdom to pay these losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't fantasize! The casualties of the Beamon Army are less than four digits, and even fewer were killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as thousands of Behemoths can be killed, then this battle will be an epic victory in the human race's counterattack against the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a Behemoth army of ten thousand people can be wiped out, even if Duke Liufeng loses all the troops in Fengyun Province, the kingdom will take care of him! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Viscount Oran's words, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. Annihilating a Beamon army of ten thousand people is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past hundreds of years, there have been only two cases in which the Beamon Legion was established and wiped out, all of which were completed after the arrival of reinforcements from various countries in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price paid, there are only two words left in the history books - miserable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Duke of Liufeng can do it, now he is a hero admired by hundreds of millions of people, not a negative example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the group of soldiers who have not completed their training and rushed to the battlefield. Even if they were replaced by the Kingdom's standing army, it would be difficult to defeat a Beamon army without ten times the strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight a war of annihilation, unless Beamon foolishly rushes into the trap. Otherwise, if you can't win, can't you run?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the human race, Bimons are all twins, one is a \"human\" and the other is a \"beast\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Zhan Beast and Behemoth are brothers, they grew up together since they were young, and their cooperation is completely intimate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of speed, it surpasses most human cavalry. Only a small number of high-quality horses can compete with them in speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fast speed + strong fighting power, this is the reason why the Beamon family can occupy the head of the five royal families with a small population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the five royal families of the Orc Empire are not constant. If a certain race falls into decline, it is also possible to be replaced by the following races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five imperial families continued to launch southern invasion wars, not only to clean up the excess population in the country, but also to take the opportunity to weaken the powerful races in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After one battle after another, the dominance of the five royal families was established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the five royal families, the number of Ding populations of other powerful races has always been kept at a low value, and it is difficult to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the nobles of the Fengyun Province have already lost a lot of strength, and it is estimated that after completing the garrison mission, their strength will be further weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there will be a second call and a third call later. I am afraid that before the war is over, they will have exhausted their vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Liufeng made another big mistake. After the war, he is bound to be separated from the nobles in the province. A major reshuffle in Fengyun Province is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a once-in-a-century opportunity, does the Holliser family have any ideas? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked straight to the point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After chatting with the map for so long, Hudson didn't think that his father-in-law just wanted to discuss the situation on the battlefield with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they really wanted to discuss it, they would discuss it slowly after giving him a slap in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He even missed the chance to catch his pigtails. It was clear that there was an important matter to discuss, so that Viscount Oran didn't care about pursuing his little things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The topic is all around the Liufeng family. It is clear that the Holliser family sees that the southeast province is difficult to expand, and wants to find opportunities in the Fengyun province to return to the ranks of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Liufeng caused too much trouble this time, and the Fengyun Province is bound to fall into chaos after the war. In order to prevent the chaos from spreading to the southeast province, I will pay close attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if the situation in Fengyun Province after the war cannot be stabilized for a long time, the Holliser family is still willing to share the worries of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said with a look of concern for the country and the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson felt that he had learned it again. Obviously wanting to take advantage of the opportunity to expand, but insisting that it is to relieve the kingdom's worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that if you want to get along well in the noble circle, you must develop a thick skin. A red face and a black heart are the correct way to open up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an ally, the Holliser family wants to expand abroad, and Hudson must support it without compromising their own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holliser family returns to the ranks of the great nobles, it will be a good thing for Hudson, and it will only be the Dalton family that needs to feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, looking at Viscount Oran's style, it is estimated that there will be no conflicts with the Dalton family at the threshold of wanting to take over Fengyun Province, and maybe the two families will conduct secret transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, the nobles in the southeastern province must be careful. Without the support of the second family in the province, the original political balance is bound to be broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the powerful Dalton family, the remaining mid-level nobles may not be able to form an alliance and continue to contend with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation where one family dominates is definitely not a good thing for the mountainous territory that is accumulating strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While thinking wildly, Hudson suddenly woke up. All the private nobles in the southeast province have not yet entered the battlefield. Who knows what will happen on the battlefield?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky, you will be beaten up by orcs like Fengyun Xingxing, and it will be too late to protect yourself, so there is no need to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not bad for everyone to be damaged together, just to pull down the horizontal line together, and the balance can still be maintained. In order to block outside peepers, everyone can join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case only a few lose heavily and the others don't, that's real trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, everyone may look at it for the sake of allies, and feel embarrassed to attack their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time goes on, the emotion will gradually fade away. Driven by interests, conflicts are inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is uncertain, but Hudson is not worried. Compared with other nobles, the mountain leaders don't have so much to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core interests are the mining area and the opened up wasteland. It is not so easy for others to come and grab it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he is alive and Bear Stearns is in charge, there will be no problem in keeping his foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation is not lost, and it is easy to restore military strength. As long as the soldiers are not wiped out by an established army, it will take a year or so to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Viscount, you are really a role model for us. The feeling of worrying about the country and the people is worth learning for everyone. If necessary, the Koslow family can also help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately issued a bad check. As for whether to honor it, and to what extent to provide support, it depends on the development of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remarks: Noble children are not equal to the noble family head. A family can have multiple children serving in the service. When the nobles are old, their sons can also serve instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's a pity that the defenders in the city have long been frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big defeat ahead made everyone lose their confidence in going out to fight in the field. Now they just want to survive the final period of service and return to their hometown alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An army with no morale can persist until now. Apart from the factor of defending the city, the most important thing is that there is no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those with two legs could not run with four legs. Without the protection of the city wall, the infantry could not escape the pursuit of the orc cavalry at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A frightened army does not have the courage to take the initiative to attack. Even if a fighter plane does appear, it can only watch in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Supervisor team, go up and separate these bastards!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex ordered angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time he led troops after becoming the crown prince. Leading the Beamon Legion with the strongest combat effectiveness, the performance can only be said to be unsatisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battle, Alex led the Beamon Legion to defeat the noble coalition forces in Fengyun Province head-on, but because of a small mistake in command, the noble coalition forces slipped into the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon Legion, which is invincible in the field, is also very weak in the face of the Bauhinia Pass in front of it. Siege has never been Beamon's strong point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Siege warfare is a process of exchanging lives for lives. Crown Prince Alex is reluctant to spend his own elite and the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, such battles that require a lot of human life are completed by vassal races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Beamon Legion, which prioritizes logistics support, the logistics of the vassal races can only be said to be better than nothing. If you want to survive on the battlefield, the corpses of your companions are the best food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are particular and unwilling to eat the same kind, they can be exchanged with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is not enough food for a long time, in order to make up for the food gap, it is common to attack weak races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the orc tribes participating in the war, the enemy is not only the human race, but also other orc tribes of different races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you go to sleep, you have to keep an eye on it, otherwise you will be on the grill when you wake up, and it will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have an order, you have to run as fast as possible. When there is no danger, allies are the greatest danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Military discipline\" is really too extravagant for a group of orc soldiers who can't get enough to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commanding a chaotic army to attack the city, naturally there will be no good experience. Crown Prince Alex also felt the pressure after being unable to win the Bauhinia Pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I painstakingly arranged such a means in the imperial court, but before I could use it, I was thrown to the front line by an order from Emperor Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Alex very doubted whether his old man had noticed something, so he quickly disrupted his layout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't preside over the overall situation in person, if you want to set off a coup in the imperial court by remote control, the possibility of success is infinitely zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if everything is ready and launched according to the plan, the probability of Alex successfully seizing power will not exceed one-third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the chance is not great, but for the imperial power struggle, this is already a very high success rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well prepared, the success rate cannot be 100%. In many cases, as long as there is 10% hope, everyone will give it a go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everything is in vain. If I don't personally sit in charge, even if the coup succeeds, I don't know who will sit on the throne?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Bimon Royal Court, there are not a few people who are qualified to compete for the throne. Alex didn't want to risk his life and went to make wedding dresses for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the defenders in the city are like birds frightened by bows and arrows, no matter how tempted they are, they refuse to come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nearby castles are the horns of each other. If you don't win the Bauhinia Pass first, other castles will not be easy to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days of strong attacks, the losses of all tribes are not small. If we continue to attack, I am afraid that the morale of the army will be unstable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to stop the attack first and look for breakthroughs elsewhere. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agustin army leader persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He never had any confidence in this crown prince who was good at eating, drinking and having fun. Alex's performance on the front line has greatly exceeded previous expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely because of this that Agustin was even more worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A dude who only knows how to eat, drink, prostitute and gamble has limited destructive power; but a crown prince with some ability can often break the sky when he does things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Alex is not young. If it was a hundred years ago, who would have doubted his military command ability, he would definitely be served by a whip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is the best weapon, Alex's edges and corners have long been smoothed. After decades of being a playboy, he has already been able to face up to his own shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"General Agustin, what suggestion do you have?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a father who wants him to die early, and a group of nephews who want to seize the throne. For Alex, whose crown prince is not secure, winning the war comes first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the frontline defenses of the Alpha Kingdom are too tight. Even if they break through the defense line of the Bauhinia Pass, they will not be able to advance far, and there will be a new defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One line of defense after another, the enemy clearly wants to use these castles to continuously bleed us and consume our strength step by step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to attack all the way, I am afraid that by the time we hit King Alpha, we will already be exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the usual method used by the enemy. In previous wars, we used too much consumption in the early stage, resulting in the lack of sufficient explosive power in the later stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the situation of the other two Terran countries is much better. As long as they break through a few lines of defense in their front line, the resistance behind them will be much weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the map, as long as we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Agustin finished speaking, Alex interrupted: \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, similar plans have been formulated in the empire long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that we are not responsible for the implementation, but the eagle family with the highest mobility. The specific plan will remain unchanged and disclosed, as long as you know there is such a thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are implementing a feint plan to attract the attention of the human race as much as possible. Of course, if you can find a chance to break through the previous levels, that would be even better! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly trustworthy performance, Alex is also forced to. As the crown prince, you must have a few cronies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pretending to be too successful in the early stage, now that he wants to accept the younger brother, Alex must show more sincerity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the general of the army, Agustin undoubtedly has a high value of attracting. Deliberately revealing part of the secrets is Alex's way of winning people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Augustus, as the most important part of the Principality of Moxi's defense against the orcs, has always been heavily guarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war broke out, this place directly became the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the guard, Urbis had a pretty good life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the war, he has sent troops to attack the orc army outside the city seven times, all of which have achieved good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the king's strict order, he would have organized the eighth surprise attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although all the kills were miscellaneous fish, compared with his colleagues who were passively beaten, Urbis could be called a great military exploit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, there is a high probability that Urbis will be able to win the title of Marshal. And not only the marshal of the Principality of Moxi, but also the marshal recognized by all the nations of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also a means of the Human Race Alliance to encourage everyone to fight against alien races. As long as they have made great achievements in foreign wars, the titles and military ranks they have won will be recognized by the entire Human Race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a title, it can be enjoyed in all human nations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Urbis has been immersed in glory, as if he has become a hero of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bang, bang, bang...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boulder that fell from the sky directly stunned the officers and soldiers defending the city. The crossbow arrows, magic crystal cannons, and trebuchets deployed on the city wall were destroyed immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Urbis, who received the message, hastily ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the signal quickly, let the Griffon Cavalry come for reinforcements!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Command the archers to immediately organize a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire army has officers who have flying monsters, and immediately take off to disrupt the formation of the Eagles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the magician group, wait for the opportunity to initiate...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Urbis still has some ability. After encountering an enemy attack, immediately use all the power at hand to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it's too late, there are too many Eaglemen who launched a sneak attack. In addition to ordinary Ying people, there are also many Ying people offering sacrifices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the power system is different, the attack method is similar to that of a magician. The only difference is that these guys can fly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the magician group made a move, they were attacked by eagle magicians and archers in the sky, causing heavy casualties in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scattered noble officers who took off into the air were powerful, but the number was too small. Under the siege of the Yingren masters, they soon fell into a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the archers below, except for a few sharpshooters, most archers couldn't shoot the high-flying Eagles at all, but the falling arrows accidentally injured many of their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chaos on the city wall created an opportunity for the orc army outside the city. Taking advantage of this chaotic opportunity, countless orcs have climbed the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the cover of air power, the city walls were quickly captured. When the griffin cavalry from the Principality of Moxi arrived, the situation was already one-sided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the number, the Griffin Cavalry was unable to compete with the Eagles for air supremacy, and quickly withdrew after a short fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lacking air power support, Urbis could only command the defenders to retreat to the inner city, using the buildings in the city to cover them and resist steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time went by, the competition around Fort Augustus became more and more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side is a continuous orc army; the other side is the defenders who have no way out and can only fight to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most heroic scene since the outbreak of the war kicked off in Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small number of strong men who evacuated with the surviving magicians, all the defenders broke out with human blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With flesh and blood, he performed an inch of mountains and rivers and an inch of blood, and wrote the tragic song of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the capital, Chris IX, who received the bad news, was so angry that he fainted on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was already evening when I woke up. Although the fighting in Fort Augustus had not yet ceased, everyone knew that it was only a matter of time before the fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst situation really happened. The orcs fought fiercely in Alpha, after all, it was just a conspiracy to lure them to relax their vigilance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War still has not escaped the law of \"pinch the soft persimmon\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Augustus is just the beginning. As the weakest of the three kingdoms of the human race, the Principality of Moxi will usher in the worst orc beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Chris IX slowly asked:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where has the situation on the front line collapsed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why did the accident happen in Fort Augustus?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When will our reinforcements be able to go up? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seemed to be a soul torture, and the faces of all the ministers were very ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, although everyone had guessed that the orcs would break through from them, they still had a glimmer of hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Alpha Kingdom was under fierce attack, everyone was still secretly glad that they had finally escaped a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the flames of war suddenly came to their heads, they realized that the preparations of the Principality of Moxi were not as sufficient as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that there would be no surprise attack by the orcs if the griffin cavalry patrolled non-stop. But the reality was very embarrassing. The orcs, who had been prepared for a long time, assassinated the patrolling griffin cavalry immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the news of the orc army's actions, even the news of the enemy's surprise attack, did not have time to send out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught off guard, Fort Augustus lost a large number of defense equipment in an instant under the attack of the Eagles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal cannons and magic crossbows that could have threatened the orc air force were directly destroyed by huge boulders without firing a shot or an arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost the anti-aircraft firepower, and the Griffin cavalry responsible for pinning down the enemy's air force also failed to play their due role due to their numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the frontline defenders resisted bravely, and the enemy was temporarily dragged to Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after the incident, we sent reinforcements, but encountered the main attack of the enemy's Eagles on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troops in charge of reinforcements suffered a lot of losses, and their marching speed was also greatly affected. I am afraid they will arrive later than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the overall consideration, we have begun to strengthen the second line of defense. Even if the enemy broke through Fort Augustus and seized the first line of defense, they would not be able to drive straight in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surviving magician group has been withdrawn, and we have successfully preserved our vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the principality is united, the war situation is still within the controllable range. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins said impassionedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the front line is not a big defeat, but just being stared at by mosquitoes, which is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking words that he didn't even believe, Martins, as Minister of Military Affairs, was also forced to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who would have thought that the orcs played their cards out of common sense, and the Eagle Legion, one of the five royal families, all entertained them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the eagle people, but also the flying races among the orcs all appeared above their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's huge air force is simply not something that the Principality of Moxi can compete with. What's more, the enemy doesn't talk about Wude's sneak attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When did the Principality of Moxi encounter this kind of battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the nobles and lords fought among themselves, and they were limited to the fighting stage. It was all an appointment time and place, and there was enough pomp to fight in groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal fighting among the great nobles may be more intense, but since the addition of orcs as neighbors, the great nobles of the Principality of Moxi have also learned to behave, and they are no longer playing Rush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Battle experience is mainly due to the orcs coming to rob. This kind of scene happens almost every year, and it's all small fights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People just want to rob money, food and goods, and they don't even bother to attack the castle. No matter how the front line is fought, Wangdu always receives good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All-out war, this is the first time the Principality of Moxi has encountered it. Most of the understanding of orcs comes from previous unreliable experiences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line has been able to hold on until now. Apart from the **** battle of the defenders, there is still no hope of escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can running on the ground compare with flying in the sky?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the cover of the buildings in the city, they will only die faster. Those who are captured will be reduced to food. If there is no way to survive, then they can only fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the north, Chris IX sighed helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the defense line was broken, it is indeed a happy event that the frontline officers and soldiers can persist until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now he is really not happy. The Minister of Military Affairs seems to be talking beautifully, but in essence he has given up the troops that are fighting and directly put his strength into the second line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with doing this militarily, but it cannot be justified logically. Especially the blow to the morale of the army is huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Chris IX can't do anything yet, and forcibly ordering rescue will only make things worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have the people along the way evacuated yet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came out, the atmosphere in the room suddenly became dignified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bad news has just come out, everyone is busy with military deployment, who cares about evacuating the people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the notification from the principality, we can only see the respective performances of the noble lords ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reaction speed is fast, you can gather people in your own castle to stick to it; if the reaction speed is slow, it will be purgatory on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you still doing in a daze, hurry up and implement it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he loves the people like his son, it's that the war has progressed to this point, and in the subsequent war of attrition, even the serfs are a force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evacuate and stick to the castle, even if you can't stop the orcs' front, it can buy time for the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beda City, I played with Melissa for several days, and finally uncovered the \"singer incident\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson, who was about to return to his territory, received a notice of an emergency meeting from the Governor's Mansion before he could say goodbye to his fiancée.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The orc army attacked Fort Augustus, and the reinforcements could not arrive in time. It was only a matter of time before it fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Augustus is the northern gate built by the Principality of Moxi with a lot of money, and it is also the core of their first line of defense. It has always been guarded by heavy troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the kingdom's past experience, even in the worst case, our first line of defense can stop the orc army for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war broke out only for more than four months, and our family was responsible for the main battles in the early stage. The defense line of Fort Augustus fell so quickly, and the high-level officials of the kingdom were very worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific loss of the Principality of Moxi has not yet been clarified, but it is estimated to be a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the main attack is Yingren Imperial Court, and it is too difficult for the main force to withdraw under Yingren's nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi responds properly, it may be possible to use the cover of night to evacuate some knights to the second line of defense to preserve their vitality as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the final result is, it is certain that the direction of the next invasion of the orcs will change, and the bitter days of the Principality of Moxi are coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the weakest family among the three kingdoms, it would be difficult for the Principality of Moxi to persevere in the event of an all-out attack from the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The capital is discussing whether to send troops to reinforce the Principality of Moxi. This matter involves a lot. As one of the most important provinces of the kingdom, we should also make our voices heard! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having the right to speak should have been a good thing. But the current situation is really not happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the Principality of Moxi can persist is of great significance to the Alpha Kingdom, and it can even affect the situation of the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the map, once the Principality of Moxi falls, the adjacent Alpha Kingdom and Warhammer Kingdom will directly open their flanks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although some fortifications have been prepared on the border, they are not at the same level as the defense lines in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the line of defense can't stand it, then you can only rely on the noble castles along the way to resist and delay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can hold on, the western provinces are bound to suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the tragic war, all the provinces of the kingdom could not escape. Once a new front is opened, it is inevitable that the southeastern province will enter the battlefield ahead of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky and don't last until reinforcements from various countries arrive, it will be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the order of the Alpha Kingdom is not handled properly, it will be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no compromise in race wars. Without the unified dispatch of the kingdom, nobles from all over the world would have to fight on their own, and the situation would be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sending troops to help the Principality of Moxi defend the line of defense\" is also not so easy to complete. Not only will it disrupt the military deployment of the Alpha Kingdom, but it will also strain its military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is whether the Principality of Moxi can withstand it, which is still unknown. If their local nobles are not strong enough, relying only on the reinforcements squeezed out from the Alpha Kingdom, it will be just a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, according to the kingdom's estimation, how long can the Principality of Moxi last?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When will the reinforcements from the human nations arrive at the earliest? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran was the first to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is too little information in hand, and it is too difficult to make a decision that will determine the future destiny of the kingdom based on that bit of fragmentary information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The most optimistic estimate is that the Principality of Moxi can last for a year and a half; the pessimists believe that they can last for at most half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, there are endless disputes. The generals on the front line have different judgments on the strength of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people think that the Principality of Moxi still has strength, and it can rely on its fortresses and geographical advantages to spend a period of time with the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people think that the Principality of Moxi is just an empty shelf, and the orc invasion has pierced their disguise, and it may fall at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation in Fort Augustus, the Principality of Moxi was obviously insufficiently prepared for this war. If it is left in the kingdom, there will be absolutely no problem that the reinforcements cannot arrive in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the reinforcements from the Terran countries, we have to wait for the alliance meeting in July. The most optimistic estimate is that the reinforcements will be next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation, the specific time for sending troops by various countries may have to be delayed for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many issues that the Terran Alliance needs to worry about. It is not only the orcs who threaten the safety of our human race, but other alien races are also ready to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the orcs have made a breakthrough in the front line, the stimulation to all races will be even greater. If other alien races take the opportunity to attack, the situation will be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to external threats, we must also consider internal issues. The restless Holy See has always been a major hidden danger for the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this cancer has penetrated deep into the bone marrow, and it is difficult to pull them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First we had a conflict with the Holy See, and now it is the turn of the Frankish Kingdom to have a conflict with the Holy See. It is simply not for a moment to let the people live in peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for them wearing human skins, I would have suspected that they were pretending to be aliens, infiltrating the human race to stir up civil strife. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Pierce's words, the temperature in the room dropped by ten degrees. Even though the fiery red sun was scorching the earth outside, it still couldn't blow away the chill in the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assessment of the strength of the Principality of Moxi is polarized, which means that the uncertainty is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be fine if the strength still exists as estimated by the optimists. The Kingdom sent a dozen or two hundred thousand reinforcements to relieve their urgent needs, and they will be able to recover later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it will be over. If the Principality of Moxi is not strong enough, even if it sends a million reinforcements, it can only send heads to the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of high uncertainty made Hudson hesitate to send troops to reinforce the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is even more pitiful is the reinforcements from various countries. At present, the three northern countries still have certain strengths. As long as one family of each country dispatches tens of thousands of elites, the custody can teach the army of orcs to be human again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these guys with their own ulterior motives just want to preserve their strength, and they don't want to work hard in this kind of pure public welfare activities with no profit at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the evaluation of the Holy See, Hudson directly chose to ignore it. The anti-Holy See is politically correct in the kingdom, and if Earl Pierce can speak well of the Holy See, then there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the Holy See really wants to see the human race in distress, but what they want is to turn the tide and restore the glory, not to kick the human race into the abyss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the kingdom, what the Holy See is doing is indeed a betrayal of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, in addition to the Kingdom, the Kingdom of Warhammer, the Duchy of Orton, the Duchy of Fick, the Earl of Ruilin... these countries bordering the Duchy of Moxi should also make a choice now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone can act together and send troops to reinforce the Principality of Moxi, the situation should be much better. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested bluntly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality of Moxi collapsed, and other human nations can wait and see, but these neighbors cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows where the orc army's next target will be. If you don't pay attention, the flames of war will burn to your own home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which is prepared, can at least resist for a while. Countries that are not prepared enough will really become meat on the orc chopping board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A family gathered tens of thousands of reinforcements, which is not a weak force. There is no guarantee that the situation will be turned back, at least it can be done to buy more preparation time for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson's proposal is good, and I will respond to the kingdom. It is estimated that there will be considerations in this regard in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What decision each country will make, I am afraid it will mostly depend on the kingdom's choice. After all, among the neighboring countries of the Principality of Moxi, apart from the Kingdom, only the Kingdom of Warhammer has some strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining bunch of small countries have very limited military strength. The military strength of some countries is even inferior to our southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to pull all countries to send troops together, the prerequisite is that the kingdom send troops first, so that they can follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle on the front line cannot be delayed, and the kingdom must express its position as soon as possible. Considering the war factor, the Kingdom Noble Council could not be held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As members of parliament, let's vote now! The voting result is not only everyone's position in the parliament, but also represents the position of my southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the future destiny of the kingdom, and it also involves the future destiny of everyone. This time, we must express our position, either support or oppose, and we cannot abstain neutrally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who support sending troops to rescue the principality of Moxi, please raise your hands! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to fall into the endless wrangling, he directly played \"cutting the mess with a quick knife\". Opinions can be put forward slowly, but voting must be carried out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results come out ahead of time, and the wrangling loses its value. After summarizing the kingdom's capital, the will of all powerful nobles is the kingdom's choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem unbelievable, but it is actually the best choice. As a shareholder of the kingdom, at such a critical moment, one must show a sense of ownership.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decisions made by everyone together, no matter whether it is right or wrong, everyone can face it calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you act arbitrarily, the pressure on the king will be great. It is right to make the right choice, and you have to bear the responsibility for the wrong judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little carelessness is a political disturbance. Facing the army of orcs, the Alpha Kingdom needs to be united now, and it can no longer withstand the internal toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Hudson raised his hand first. It is better for the flames of war to burn in the Principality of Moxi than to spread to the territory of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the southeast province is in the rear of the kingdom, so it is safe to fight over. But once the western provinces are corrupted, the burden of providing supplies for the frontline army will all fall on the eastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, not only money and food will be needed, but soldiers will also be provided, and everyone will even have to lead the troops to the front line in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the family property of the mountain land, bankruptcy is a matter of minutes. There is no hope for the great cause of land reclamation, and the supply of money and food at the front line must be given priority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many nobles who have similar concerns. Hudson made a start, and then everyone followed in twos and threes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's interesting is that the sheriffs of the Dalton family also raised their hands in unison. Obviously, Governor Pierce also supported the issue of sending troops to rescue the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone has seen the results, and I will report the truth to the capital. After all the nobles who are eligible to vote have voted, the final aggregated results will be the final decision of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is getting more and more difficult, and I hope everyone will put more effort into preparing for the war. The more you prepare now, the more likely you will come back alive in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Together, I don't want to see someone shrouded in horse leather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remind everyone, in view of the current complicated situation, the time for our recruitment may be brought forward! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is concern, but more is seeing the tragedy of the losers, and I don't want to follow in the footsteps of those unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the establishment of the kingdom, once the noble private army in the southeastern province is reorganized, each county guard will be appointed as the head of the army, and the governor will be the commander of the group army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the same organization system, when performing tasks, there is a high probability that they will act together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the younger brother is not good enough, he will be implicated as the boss. The orc army doesn't care so much, and they will beat them hard if they find a weakness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to survive on the battlefield, the best way is to increase the number of troops as much as possible, and turn the troops in your hands into elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's military service tasks, in addition to specifying the minimum number of troops to send, also encourage everyone to bring more troops to go out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the legion of 10,000 people is overstaffed to 100,000 people, the Kingdom's logistics department will distribute supplies according to the actual number of people. In a word: I am not afraid that you have many soldiers, but I am afraid that you have no soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The larger and more elite the army, the higher the probability of completing the task, and the safer the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as all the nobles complete the task, the orc army will never be able to enter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the actual situation, it is impossible to read the history books.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles stationed in the early stage were able to barely complete the task with the help of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the strength of the army is tight in the later stage, reinforcements cannot be in place in time, and that is when the defense line collapses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous wars, it was only a matter of time before the defense line collapsed. The difference is limited to when it crashed and in whose hands it crashed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't panic if you lose a battle, because when the battle line collapses, everyone is often losing the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the record is good, there is no need to worry about accountability. The ones who will be held accountable are usually the ones who haven't completed the task, and haven't even caused effective damage to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worried that his subordinates are too powerful, that is purely overthinking. No matter how awesome a character is, on the battlefield, he has to behave with his tail between his legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too active, that's what the orcs are targeting. After being beaten by the most ruthless orcs, even if one life can be saved, heavy losses are inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why the Alpha Kingdom can maintain balance for a long time. No matter how powerful the nobles are, once the war breaks out, they will be beaten back to their original form.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the five great nobles of the Northland who were so awesome before, returned to the same starting line with the kingdom's great nobles after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the fief area is larger, the losses they suffer are more serious. Not only the army lost a lot, but the serfs under his command also suffered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the evacuation and transfer of the orc army, they can only transfer to the nearby castle fortress. If they want to evacuate to the rear, even if the kingdom is willing to come forward to organize, the old and weak body will not allow long-distance travel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of the Governor's Mansion, Hudson's whole body became heavy. The changes in the Principality of Moxi were like a heavy burden on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending reinforcements, can the decadence of the Principality of Moxi be restored?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can answer this question. In short, the footsteps of the war are further approaching the mountainous territory, and the time for participating in the war may have to be advanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, it also means that this war is more cruel and difficult to fight.

If you want to regain Fort Augustus, now is the best chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I'm afraid I will disappoint you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi was shocked by this sudden bad news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to asking for help from various countries, they are busy transferring people and deploying a second line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few military generals who proposed to take back Fort Augustus, most of the nobles were in awe of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the resistance of the Augustsburg defenders is still tenacious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of evacuating under the cover of night, they stayed and entangled with the orc army, buying time for the Principality of Moxi. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Cassidy said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing on the standpoint of the Warhammer Kingdom, they naturally hope that the Principality of Mosi can regain its lost ground and rebuild the defense line of Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is different from the standpoint of the Principality of Moxi. What they need is to preserve their strength and deal with the orcs as much as possible, instead of fighting with the orc army with the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it will be a blast, and there is hope to retake Fort Augustus from the orcs, but what should we do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dilapidated defense line after the baptism of war can hardly stop the attack of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The line of defense recovered after paying a heavy price, but it couldn't stop the orc's soldiers. Instead, it is better to directly activate the second line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for where the orcs will fight after they capture Fort Augustus, the Principality of Moxi doesn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they can abide by the rules, and if they can't, they retreat all the way. If you can't withdraw, you get into the castle and become a nail house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing many noble castles, time does not allow the orc army to pull out one by one, everyone can gamble on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of the Alpha Kingdom in resisting the invasion of the orc army, as long as the tortoise shell is strong enough, the orc army will attack with another target after the attack is frustrated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Survive the most difficult time, the reinforcements from various countries of the human race will come, and then everyone will fight out of the castle to recover the lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can hardly take care of myself, and allies are naturally out of their consideration. If the orc army turned their troops around, they might even hold a secret banquet to celebrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Start the backup plan. Immediately deploy heavy troops in the northeast region of the kingdom, and be sure to block the orc army from outside the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, I will personally invite the old marshal out of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, only he has the ability to keep the orcs out of the country for more than half a year! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said physically and mentally exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out. The Alpha Kingdom couldn't break through, so it turned around and attacked the Principality of Moxi. Obviously, the orcs also knew that the persimmons were picky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same is true for the next battle. Whoever shows fatigue first may become the focus of the orcs' next attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single orc empire cannot be the opponent of the entire human race. To win the war, they must involve more alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the reputation of the orcs, it is almost impossible to fool everyone into joining the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only way is to use a good record to tell all races that the overlord is corrupt and the time is ripe to overthrow this mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to have a good record, you can only pick good bullies and beat them hard. Continuing the previous style of play and fighting against the Alpha Kingdom will definitely have no future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, Joseph II could only let go of his prejudices and invite the most prestigious marshal in the Royal Army to come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Marshal Borg is old and has retired for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now go to trouble his old man, I'm afraid it's a little bad, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Guy reminded vaguely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political struggles cannot be avoided by any country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in peaceful times, there are more such things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg, the pillar of the kingdom, is a victim of political struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the morality of the Warhammer Kingdom has not yet fallen, and the political struggle still abides by the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the highly respected old marshal, Joseph II only tried to drive him home for the elderly, and did not kill them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no right or wrong in political struggles, it is all caused by power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg's prestige is too high, which affects the royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king wants to be in power, driving him home is just normal operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that it is needed, it is understandable to invite people out again. Only in this way, the dominance is in the hands of the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Retired once, but it is not in vain. It is inevitable to take the opportunity to raise conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Marshal Borg is selfless and doesn't ask for anything, his faction will not be willing to be lonely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For vested interest groups, it is imperative to cut flesh from themselves to appease the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little carelessness caused another political disturbance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Needless to say, Marshal Borg is the pillar of our Warhammer Kingdom. Now that the country is in crisis, he will definitely not refuse!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Warhammer, Marshal Borg is a legend. He once tried his best to save the kingdom from the brink of danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a political competitor, it will not affect Joseph II's respect from the heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Orton, looking at the request letter from the Principality of Moxi, King Orton XIX is in a bad mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good neighbor, the Principality of Orton is only five hundred miles away from Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may sound like a long distance, but this is the magical world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi collapses, the fastest wolf cavalry of the orcs will be able to kill them at their door the next day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mighty Principality of Moxi can't stop the orcs' attack, and the Principality of Orton is even more hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building defense lines?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Principality of Orton never expected that the war would be so close to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous orc invasions did not affect them. The Principality of Orton didn't take the orc invasion to heart at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the three northern countries were at the forefront, and they followed suit, shouting slogans and the war was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Three Kingdoms can't stand it, it will be in the middle and late stages of the war. At that time, the reinforcements from the various countries of the human race will almost start, and they only need to take the army along with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the strong strength of the human race, they can reap countless flowers and applause if they are crushed all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Principality of Moxi, what a bunch of trash!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a performance, he still dares to be called the first principality of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really don't know how this name fell on them. It is simply a shame to my human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at the Alpha Kingdom next door. After fighting with the orcs for so long, they are still entangled on the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom on the side also performed a hundred times, a thousand times better than them...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chattering curses exposed Orton Nineteen's inner anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a quiet melon eater, Orton XIX has been known for his stability since he succeeded to the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has not carried out internal reforms, and has not provoked neighborhood conflicts externally, let alone waged wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My biggest hobby is to watch other people fight and comment on it along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a king is not good, but he is not a prodigal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting a king who doesn't make a fuss, the Duchy of Orton has lived a pretty good life these years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no conscription for military service, at least the living standard of the nobles in the country is rising in a straight line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that noble lords can make a fortune even if they guard their fiefs and farm land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a law-abiding king is rare in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that people sit at home, and disaster comes from heaven.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The approach of the orc army and the letter of help from the Principality of Moxi, when the two are added together, it means that the war is coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the matter has developed to this point, and the strength of the Principality of Moxi alone may not be able to stop the attack of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX personally wrote a letter of appeal for help. The situation on the front line may be even worse than what their envoys said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Principality of Moxi cannot sustain itself, the Principality will soon be dragged into the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best to help them stabilize the battle line and block the orc army from outside the country. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own king is good at everything, but when things happen, he tends to panic easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs is coming, it's really scary, isn't it coming yet?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's the use of complaining about the incompetence of the Moxi Principality, the key is to find a way to solve the problem. According to past experience, the orc army was fierce in the early stage of the invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cannon fodder race is not exhausted, the five imperial courts of the orcs will not care about casualties. A war that ignores casualties is naturally very cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries of the human race delayed the dispatch of troops because they did not want to exchange their elites with these cannon fodder. Leave this cruel war of attrition to the three northern countries to complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of reinforcements, Orton XIX woke up instantly. In the previous battle, they had provided supplies to the Principality of Moxi once, and even the army was worried about this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have no objection to sending troops to help the Principality of Moxi stabilize the front line. But the question is, do we have the strength?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the force of the whole country is pressed, or only tens of thousands of reinforcements are sent, I am afraid that it is not enough for the orc army to charge! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orton XIX spread his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient strength, this is the biggest problem for the Principality of Orton. They are also principalities, so they are divided into three, six, and nine classes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A big country like the Principality of Moxi has a population of 8 million and a territory of 700,000 square kilometers. It can mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the Principality of Orton is only one third of that of the Principality of Moxi, with a population of just over 2 million and a standing army of just over 10,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the whole country is mobilized, it will be difficult to play much role in the face of the menacing orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, of course we can't do it alone. However, when something happened to the Principality of Moxi, it is not only the Principality of Orton that is threatened, other countries also need to contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's all act together. If you have money, you can provide food, if you have food, you can provide people. It is still possible to gather a support army to reinforce the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received news from the Alpha Kingdom that most of the nobles in their country are inclined to send troops to rescue the Principality of Moxi, and there may be results soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need is to do a good job in the work of neighboring countries, and try to attract as many countries as possible to participate in the rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not far from the Terran Alliance meeting in July.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to be authorized by the Principality to join the lobbying team formed by the Alpha Kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom, and the Moxi Principality to jointly promote the Terran Alliance to join the war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dubs suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king is weak, the ministers are strong. This is a set of seesaws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King Orton XIX had no response plan. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dubs had to stand up to share the king's worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diplomatic affairs are left to you. The moxi principality's **** may not last long, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will implement it as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, a war mobilization order is issued. If the Alpha Kingdom is willing to take the lead in sending troops to rescue, the Principality must follow up as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orton XIX said cheerfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One's own power alone cannot solve the problem. It would be best if more countries could share the burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this kind of proposal has a very high probability of being supported by neighboring countries. After all, no one wants to be the next target of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar scene was staged almost at the same time among the neighboring countries of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific details may be different, but among the topics discussed, \"should we send troops to rescue\" is absolutely indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The court is discussing, and the people are not idle. The tense atmosphere of the war began to spread, spreading from the three kingdoms on the front line to the hinterland of the human race for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More and more countries are participating in the discussion, but in terms of specific actions, the slowness still cannot be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no threat of life and death, and the mobilization speed of the countries in the hinterland of the human race is completely incomparable with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the results of the votes of the nobles in various provinces were gathered in the hands of Caesar III, the topic of discussion in the Alpha Kingdom was no longer whether to send troops, but how many troops to send?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who to send there?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When to act?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military mobilization can affect the whole body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous military deployments of the Alpha Kingdom were aimed at defending against the orc army that invaded from the north. Although Xi Mian is not completely unprepared, it is certain that it is insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly wanted to reinforce the Principality of Moxi in the west. In terms of troop mobilization, the rhythm was obviously disrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the standing army cannot move. Although the orcs have changed their attack direction, there are still a lot of troops on the front line. No one can guarantee that they will feint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, given the situation in the Principality of Moxi, even if we send reinforcements, we may not be able to help them hold the line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Augustsburg defense line has little direct impact on us, as it is blocked by the Parhati Mountains, the local terrain is not conducive to the deployment of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If their follow-up line of defense is not secured, the blocking effect of the mountains will not be great. Our western front will soon be exposed to the iron heels of the orc army, and the kingdom must prepare for the worst in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the only troops that can be drawn are noble private troops, and they must also be noble private troops from non-western provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the logistical problems that may be brought about by the labor expedition. The military department suggested that the first batch of reinforcements should not be too many. After arriving in the Principality of Moxi, it will be decided whether to send further reinforcements according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the first batch of reinforcements, it is best to control the strength between 50,000 and 100,000. The kingdom only needs to mobilize the noble private army in one province to complete the rescue mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or from the several provinces in the southeast, each of the aristocratic private troops from a county can be dispatched to form an expeditionary army to complete the task. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Afiero, shared his worries worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from his expression that he is a pessimist and has no confidence in the Principality of Moxi at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending troops to rescue is just doing what people can do and obeying the destiny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern front is already a battlefield, and the western front may become a battlefield at any time. There are actually not many options left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces at the top of the mobilization sequence must not be moved now. They were all ready to send troops to the northern border, but if they suddenly changed direction, coordination alone would be a hassle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the several provinces behind the kingdom, Caesar III also fell into hesitation for a while. After a long while, he slowly said: \"Tune it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rescue pressure is all on one province, and it is easy to disrupt their mobilization steps. If only the noble private army from one county is mobilized, the pressure on everyone will be much less. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is just an excuse on the surface. The deeper reason is to rescue the Principality of Moxi, which is to fight in a foreign country, and the risk is much higher than performing tasks in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not careful, you will be killed by your allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the pressure is placed on a province. In case of an accident in the Principality of Moxi, unfortunately, an entire army is wiped out, and the entire organizational system of a province will be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very unfavorable for the mobilization of the late kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, big nobles are not easy to mess with. People may not buy this kind of high-risk mission. A little carelessness can also set off political turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is not defending the country, but rescuing the Principality of Moxi. It is still a bit far-fetched to insist on military obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within the rules of the game, even if it refuses to execute, it is justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But it was another matter to send troops to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobility is realistic, and you must weigh risks and benefits before doing things. Obviously this mission is a typical high risk, low reward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unfamiliar transnational combat is a challenge for both noble officers and low-level soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of accidents, it is necessary to coordinate reinforcements, and the object of dealing with them is the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort August defense line, such an important strategic location, the reinforcements failed to arrive in the first time, which is enough to prove the level of internal coordination and mobilization capabilities of the Principality of Mosi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden changes on the battlefield will most likely not count on allies, and it is self-evident how high the risk is to solve it with one's own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High risk, yet not high return. Fighting for others is also a big problem in the verification of military achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the good words now, the statistics of military exploits are the same as those in China. If you really made a contribution, it will definitely be greatly discounted in the final evaluation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can be the same is the military merit brought by killing the enemy. The strategic significance and strategic value increase brought by the battle are basically negligible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the evaluation of military merit, these strategic values ​​occupy an important proportion. For a strategic victory, I don't know how many enemies have to be killed to be worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many disadvantages, but it is not completely bad. As a guest army, you don't need to live and die with the Principality of Moxi. If you can't win, you can wait for the opportunity to make a \"strategic transfer\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite is: be able to slip away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not only a test of reaction ability, but also who the enemy is. At least facing the army of the Eagle Court, it is very difficult to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there is an errand that no one wants to do, it means trouble is coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom assigned tasks, and Earl Pierce encountered this problem. After all the good things have been said, no one has taken the initiative to sign up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly assigning tasks does not exist. Those present were all capable factions, and the Viscount Sith was the only one who insisted on being soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The softest persimmon has a big daddy behind it. As important ministers of the same kingdom, even if you don't give face, you can't do too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that Viscount Sith has no one under his command. Except for the hundreds of elites of his direct line and a group of serf soldiers, he can't command the nobles in the county at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task was put on him, but he couldn't carry it out in the end. Forcing an army to deal with it, the kingdom can't explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just to mobilize the military power of a county, but not let the entire southeastern province bear it all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the southeast province should bear all the responsibility, Earl Pierce himself would be the first to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves vital interests, and it is not acceptable to be unrealistic. This kind of rescue mission is not a mandatory obligation that the noble lord must perform, and it is normal to be emotional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the audience, Governor Pierce said to everyone with a gloomy face: \"Since everyone is unwilling to take the initiative to sign up, let the Lord of Dawn decide all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, prepare fifteen wooden sticks and engrave one of them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's understandable to be in a bad mood. There were a total of fifteen sheriffs present, and there were not a few of them from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decide by lottery, the probability of this unlucky job falling on me is not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if this kind of thing cannot be done fairly, no matter who is forcibly assigned, it will be strongly opposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't rely on force to force people to go to the battlefield, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing that violates the rules of the game, once done, will inevitably cause a strong rebound from the small and medium nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to be the next unlucky guy. The small and medium-sized nobles in the province made a fuss together, and no one was going to carry out the task, not to mention, maybe the civil strife would be detonated first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a governor to do his part, leaving as soon as possible is the right way, staying will only bring disaster to the country and the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of lottery, the nature changed suddenly. Everyone has the same chance, with a one-fifteenth chance, it would be unlucky if they could all be drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficiency of the guards was very fast, and they brought in a bamboo tube containing fifteen wooden sticks in no time. Seeing this scene, Hudson very much suspected that Governor Pierce had prepared it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar gameplays are leftovers from his play. It's just that Hudson can play black box operations, which is aimed at the little nobles in the county who are easy to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big table in front of me is not a fuel-efficient lamp. Even if it is a lottery, everyone will not easily believe that Governor Pierce is fair and fair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Here are fifteen wooden sticks. Fifteen county guards draw lots on behalf of their respective counties, and each draws a wooden stick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever draws the engraved wooden sign will bring the army in his county to participate in this rescue mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the specific details, we will continue to discuss after the county responsible for dispatching troops is determined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid suspicion, the members of the Dalton family please stay at the back, and the drawing will be done after you have drawn lots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wooden sticks are all here. After the drawing is completed, if you have any doubts, you can check it under the witness of everyone. Now all the county guards are invited to come forward and draw. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Governor Pierce's words, Hudson found himself connoted. Repeatedly emphasizing the \"sheriff\", isn't it just telling him not to come?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a representative, but he alone does not participate in the lottery, which is obviously blatant discrimination!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson realized something was wrong. This is not just discrimination, it is clearly to exclude him, the lucky knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't do it by luck, you can still do it by cheating. The wooden signs are all the same, so there is a slight weight difference between the wooden sign with engraving and the wooden sign without engraving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Bear Stearns playing gravity, it is a breeze to avoid abnormal wooden signs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if he doesn't participate, the key is that the bad luck knight corresponding to his good luck knight also happens to be in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Viscount Sith step forward to draw lots, Hudson closed his eyes directly. That guy is fine in normal times, but luck will go wrong at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just take a look at his tragic experience. He is also the son of the Duke, but Sith is an illegitimate child, and he lost the first wave when he was reincarnated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not very clear about how he is doing in the Northland. Anyway, in the southeast province, when the two counties were choosing one of the two counties, they happened to bump into him, a traverser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Setting up a business center to hold events can catch up with the tragedy of nobles fighting and hammering people to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when more than 100 nobles drew lots for the material delivery mission, he was able to draw the worst one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of luck, which is comparable to the possession of a mold god, really makes it difficult for Hudson to have confidence in him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone put their wooden sticks on the table and let everyone be a witness together. If the sheriff who draws the carved wooden sticks has any doubts in his mind, he can come up and check now.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said with a smile on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his expression, it can be seen that this unlucky job did not fall on the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a happy expression is definitely not what a mature politician should have, unless he really can't help it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Viscount Sith who picked up the wooden stick to check and compare one by one, Hudson called out from the bottom of his heart: Damn it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I had a bad premonition in advance, this premonition was too accurate. There is a one-fifteenth chance of being hit, and I don't know what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Viscount Sith fiercely, Hudson turned his head directly. The governor asked for an inspection, but he actually went forward to inspect it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I was fooled by my own luck, or if my head was flooded. Even if there is such a black-box operation, it can only be admitted with gritted teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he drew the lottery himself. Even if someone marked it, if it wasn't for Viscount Sith's bad luck, he wouldn't have just drawn it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lottery not only avoided the mission, but also put the nails of the Northland nobles behind the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Viscount Sith's current luck, the probability of returning from the battlefield alive is really not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to do anything, you can pull out this nail, and you can leave Grand Duke Kavadia speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Viscount Sith didn't find the problem, Wright County will be responsible for supporting the Principality of Moxie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have any comments, you can raise them now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said kindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that I am really asking for everyone's opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson resolutely said: \"Your Excellency, as we all know, Viscount Sith is weak and sick, and does not have the ability to lead troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better complete the task, I suggest that Wright County be replaced by a more capable nobleman who is responsible for leading the army in the county to participate in this operation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the voice fell to the ground, everyone's eyes were on Viscount Sith. That burly figure does not look like a weak and sick person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that Hudson was talking nonsense, everyone nodded in agreement, as if Viscount Sith was really weak and sick, and didn't have the ability to lead troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** decides the position, and the identity of the same local nobles determines that everyone must support \"our own people\" on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the scene in front of him, Viscount Sith gritted his teeth angrily. He has never been insulted like this in all these years since he was a child.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to **** military power, at least find a suitable excuse. Directly slandering him for being weak and sick, and not being able to lead troops, is clearly confusing right and wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shut up! Hudson, you, you, you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the words came to his lips, Sith suddenly found himself unable to speak. Arguing on someone else's territory, he, an outsider, was doomed from the start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wins the quarrel, it's useless. It's not a day or two since he, the empty sheriff, has been emptied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task was given to him, but he couldn't carry it out. In the end, it is necessary to hand over the dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is to fall out with everyone here, for the sake of everyone's face, maybe he will really become \"weak and sickly\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many secret methods to assassinate people in the continent of Aslante. Sith didn't think that the people present who turned black and white would have a high level of moral integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Sith, don't get excited. We all understand what you mean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, everything is based on the overall situation of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare that Viscount Sith is so high-minded, so this time, Viscount Hudson will be the head of the expeditionary force to support the Principality of Moxi, and will be responsible for leading the expedition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the kingdom's regulations, the limit for our southeastern province to send troops this time should not be less than 15,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Hudson, is there any problem? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce's words left Sith completely speechless. There is no point in struggling. Even if he wins the battle, he will not be able to gather an army of fifteen thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is not difficult to assemble an army according to the kingdom's regulations. However, the military obligations transferred from my Koslow family must also be included.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the expedition of the army, the recruitment tasks in the kingdom can no longer involve Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering practical issues, all the nobles and lords led troops to the expedition, and no one took charge of the overall situation. Now the monthly material delivery task also needs to be taken over by the governor's office.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the adjustment of the supply of front-line materials in the later period, and we must wait for our return to discuss. Until then, Wright County's obligations can only be reduced but not increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the expedition of the army, the security issues in the county also need everyone to pay attention, and the cult organization should not be allowed to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to specific matters in the county, it is best to sit down and discuss slowly after we return. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson put forward the conditions unceremoniously. Although the unlucky job was brought back by Viscount Sith, he couldn't go on an expedition in such a vague way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, Wright County is still representing the southeastern province this time. Some necessary rights and interests still need to be fought for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, please rest assured. These are all due meanings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the expedition of the army, any trouble encountered by Wright County, the Governor's Office will not sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present can supervise. If there is a problem with the Governor's Mansion, everyone can impeach the king. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce promised with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Help to stabilize the rear is a must. If this cannot be done, how can the aristocrats feel relieved to lead troops to the expedition?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who dares to do something during the army's expedition will be severely punished by the kingdom. Even the great nobles dare not try their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this kind of matter, once the board is laid down, the charges will be: colluding with the orcs, betraying the human race, and intending to bring disaster to the rear of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is it impossible to mix in the Alpha Kingdom, but it is also impossible to mix in the entire human world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the kingdom made a big fuss, but it happened in history, and it once caused heavy losses to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the event, everyone learned a lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to define whether orcs have been bought or not, so we can simply make a one-size-fits-all approach and label all those involved as betrayal of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearing this kind of crime, he directly enjoys the hunting package of the Human Race Alliance. In all human nations, they are treated as the most wanted criminals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strict to almost abnormal punishment, established rules for the nobles of the kingdom. Only then will everyone be able to lead troops to the expedition with peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great people have big families and great careers, and they are reluctant to try their own methods, but it is hard to say whether the little people in charge of execution will fish in troubled waters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson raised it here, seemingly making a fuss over a molehill. In fact, it is to attract everyone's attention. As long as the big shots show a little concern, the executives below will be extraordinarily disciplined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson finalize the result in a few words, Viscount Sith, who was ignored, said angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you don't need me, you can solve everything. I, the sheriff, are an eyesore if I stay here, so I suggest to the kingdom to get rid of me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he is angry, but he is actually forced to do nothing. An expedition to the Principality of Moxi is about to take place, and Sith doesn't want to die young yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the title of sheriff, not only does he not have the right to command the army, but he must also accept the command of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blocked the way of others, and fought under the command of others. If there is no accident on the battlefield, it will be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, Viscount Sith didn't need to worry about it, because there was a grand duke father, and no one dared to lay hands on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the current situation is different. From the outbreak of the war to the present, the northern nobles have received a large amount of supplies supported by the southern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of other people's soft hands, the northern nobles can't stand up to the logistics nannies who provide money, food and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the southeast province dare to treat him like this now, it is clear that the deterrent power of his grand duke father is not enough to make everyone continue to buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't take advantage of his father's influence and find a way to step down from the hot-handed position of sheriff, he might be killed on the battlefield at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Viscount Sith fiercely, Governor Pierce responded angrily: \"Okay, very good!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Viscount Sith feels that his ability is limited and he is not qualified for the position of sheriff, then submit his resignation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that they want to drive away the nobles of the Northland, but according to Earl Pierce's plan, this is not the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith withdrew, and Hudson must be in charge. For the Dalton family, it is the best choice for the two to drag each other down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not for the outbreak of war, there is no time to provoke infighting. Pierce had already fanned the flames between the two and kept them fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the resignation of Viscount Sith, it is impossible to approve it. For his own benefit, Earl Pierce would not let this resignation appear in front of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the Dalton family, the best destination for Sith is to die on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then they can take advantage of the trend and fuel the flames behind the scenes, so that the Koslow family will have a blood feud with Grand Duke Kavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by interests. Who made Hudson rise too fast and aroused the fear of the Dalton family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of the war, it is inconvenient for Earl Pierce to do something. It is still feasible to secretly guide the development of the situation, wait until after the war to ignite, and create a few enemies for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While selling favors, while stabbing a knife. In the aristocratic world, it is really normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaintly aware of the conspiracy, Hudson shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anything, once the calculation is overdone, is the time for backlash to break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resignation under the watchful eyes of the public seems to be an act of anger, but it is not Sith who sensed the danger and sent him a political signal for peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The poor hand got a bad luck lottery, and all the nobles in the county had to perform the task of narrowly dying. Even if everyone didn't say anything about this account, they would definitely remember Sith in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Offending so many people at once, it is quite dangerous on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is impossible not to vent your anger when encountering such unlucky things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Viscount Sith got it cheaply, many people are still unwilling to accept the reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Criticism is indispensable in the bottom of my heart: Why didn't Hudson smoke it, but let the unlucky Sith get it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Hudson's difficulties, they ignored them directly. It cannot be expected that every nobleman is a smart person who can see through the essence of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lucky character design, although it brought countless benefits to Hudson, but it also brought negative effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, when drawing lots, those old foxes just kicked him out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, they didn't go out. You can't just fight the boss in the province just for a lottery, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military obligations must be completed sooner or later, and there is no way to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running to fight in the Principality of Moxi, there is no obligation to defend the land. For Hudson personally, it may not be a bad thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Hudson fell into the pit with the nobles of Wright County, but in fact it was the ordinary nobles who were really unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no obligation to constrain, and in a critical moment, Hudson can run away without pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal safety is guaranteed, which is why Hudson can quickly accept the reality and face the task calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Sith, why didn't you come?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, send someone to remind you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could he, the sheriff, be absent from such an important meeting! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be concerned, as if without Sith, the sheriff, today's meeting would not be able to proceed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respected Viscount Hudson, the convoy of Viscount Sith left the city of Beda two days ago, and the direction is north.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not surprised by this result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military power was snatched away, and all the nobles in the county were offended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't run away quickly, you might have to follow the army to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Really think nobles are easy to mess with?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge for revenge, retribution for grievances, is the true portrayal of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to follow to the Principality of Moxi, with Sith's luck, it's only a matter of time before you are killed by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hatred has already arisen, and this cannot be resolved by sending out a political signal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Funk is out of the question, Sith aren't that stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, he should take his own initiative to sign up for the front line and join the kingdom's standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the face of Grand Duke Kavadia, the military should still buy such a trivial matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the loss of hundreds of elites, Hudson doesn't feel bad. Being able to get rid of this bad luck is the key.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the relaxed expressions of the nobles, it is clear that everyone has similar thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Bazel, are you sure you read correctly, Viscount Sith really took someone away?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, how dare I talk nonsense about such things?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to confirm the authenticity of the news, I also went to Dadir City on the way here. Viscount Sith is indeed not in the city, and it is his butler who is in charge of the affairs of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I learned from the butler that Viscount Sith was urgently recruited by the front line. Because of the rush of time, it was too late to say goodbye to everyone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Bazel replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he wants to betray Sith, but that everything has happened, and there is no way to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, everyone has been away for two days. Even if everyone is angry, it is impossible to lead the team to catch up now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the time, Viscount Sith took people away almost as soon as he returned from Beda City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This decisiveness alone is not comparable to ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farewell is impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have made everyone so miserable, if you dare to come to the meeting, you will be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An empty sheriff can't deter everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Get angry, beat people up, and beat them up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I can come back alive. Who cares about the face of a grand duke who is thousands of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waving his hand to stop everyone's discussion, Hudson said slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since the governor of Sith accepted the call of the kingdom to leave, I will be in charge of the next affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task of rescuing the principality of Moxi has now fallen on us in Wright County, and it is meaningless to say anything else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the kingdom's regulations, the minimum number of troops sent should not be less than 15,000, and they must be elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no room for negotiation, and without the Sith Sheriff, the task still cannot be discounted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assignment of tasks is still the old rules, and everything is carried out according to the rules of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Special circumstances can be considered as appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Underage nobles are not required to go to the battlefield. However, other military obligations must continue to be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elder nobles can be replaced by the heir to the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These rules, I think everyone knows it well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What I want to emphasize is the quality of the soldiers, they must be elite, and all **** cannot be stuffed into them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if I don't pursue it, the Kingdom's test will not pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, I will be caught and embarrass everyone. Don't blame me for being ungrateful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to be too pessimistic!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed dangerous to go to the Principality of Moxi, but it is not a must-do mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that you want to preserve the strength of your family, but the premise is that you yourself must survive first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously he could come back alive, but if he lost his life in vain because the soldiers under him were unqualified, it would be a joke! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the little brother can fight is directly related to whether he can win the battle. Leading an army for the first time, Hudson didn't want to be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to erect a character set, but it is very simple to destroy it. As long as he loses a few battles, the reputation he has worked so hard to earn will be ruined directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to lose the battle, you must create a tragic heroic image of \"crimes other than war\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the number of enemies killed is enough and the record is impressive enough, even if the entire army is wiped out, everyone will help find the reason why they have to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the Alpha Kingdom has done a very good job. When evaluating the merits of famous generals, they always look at the record and casualties together, not just judging heroes by victory or defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out by orcs. As the weaker side, if they were held accountable mechanically based on the theory of victory or defeat, the kingdom would have no generals to use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of the enemy's absolute strength, if he can persist for a few more days, or if the defeat is not so ugly, he is already at the level of a famous general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the frontline generals are required to defeat the strong with the weak, that is purely a disease of the brain. Forced to succeed will only create a group of adventurers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A kingdom that is full of resilience and survived countless wars is destined not to be an adventurous kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to gambling on a chance, everyone prefers to play it safe. Even if you keep losing battles, as long as you delay enough as planned, it will be a strategic victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on this sound guiding ideology, the strategic deployment of the Alpha Kingdom has always been conservative, and all campaigns must serve the strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only sacrifice is the reputation of the frontline commander. Almost all the main generals of the kingdom are piled up in a series of defeats, and even the number of defeats is far more than that of victories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"famous general\" can only be talked about within the kingdom, and it is not recognized by the outside world at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people even attribute the fact that the Alpha Kingdom has been passively beaten because of the lack of \"famous generals\" in the Alpha Kingdom, as long as there are a few \"famous generals\", the occupation can be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson completely dismissed this statement. Being able to stand still after being beaten by orcs for hundreds of years is enough to show that the strategy implemented by the Alpha Kingdom is correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the playing methods of the mainland countries, either win a big victory or suffer a big defeat. The Alpha Kingdom has long since disappeared in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the absolute difference in strength cannot be reversed by winning one or two battles; but as long as the bet is lost once, the kingdom will be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, the time for this mobilization mission is too urgent. Can you ask the kingdom for it and wait until after the autumn harvest?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler's proposal was also what everyone wanted. According to the normal mobilization sequence, next year will be the fastest time for everyone to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden recruitment mission not only disrupted everyone's planning for the territory, but also disrupted everyone's military training plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at what Hudson said before, asking everyone to bring out elite soldiers. In fact, Wright County can't gather 15,000 elite soldiers at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Koslow family is added, at most half of the elite can be gathered, and the rest can only be filled with serf soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation, it is impossible for the Koslow family to play stud, and the nobles cannot come out in full force, and the number of elite soldiers will be even smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elite soldiers are not trained in a day, but the autumn harvest can be seen immediately. Even if it is going to the battlefield, everyone can't forget the food in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a pity, Baron Kettley. The battle situation in the Principality of Moxi is tense. The orc army has completely occupied the defense line of Fort Augustus, and the soldiers are pointing directly at the city of Terence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the power of the Principality of Moxi, no one can guarantee how long it can last. In order to help our allies stabilize the front line, we must set off as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can rest assured that Wright County is not the only one who sent troops to reinforce the Principality of Moxi. The six major provinces in the southeast region of the empire will draw troops from a county to participate in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other neighboring countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also coordinating. At least the countries bordering the Principality of Moxi will not sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the total strength of reinforcements from various countries to the Principality of Moxi will not be less than 500,000. Coupled with the existing military power of the Principality of Moxi, it is still very hopeful to stop the orc army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson worked hard to paint the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom's reinforcements are certain, but whether or not other countries will send reinforcements, and what kind of troops will be sent, are all unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called 500,000 reinforcements are just a random number made up purely to increase the confidence of the younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    True or false is not important, the key is that everyone needs a heart to comfort. Only the strength of Wright County is a drop in the ocean when it is put into the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not careful, the whole army will be wiped out. Even if the well-prepared Alpha Kingdom's front lines were completely annihilated, it was not unheard of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the Principality of Moxie, the army stationed at the defense line of Fort Augustus, except for a few noble officers who escaped, were unexpectedly taken over by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a prodigal behavior has to be shocking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is special. Facing the army of Ying people throwing stones, reinforcements cannot arrive in time. That is just the self-consolation of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the preparations in advance were still insufficient, and the reinforcements failed to arrive in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the defense line is regained, the city defense fortifications are used, and the magic crystal cannon and magic crossbow attack the Eagle Air Force fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rescue of their own people is so ineffective. Once the guest army encounters a similar situation, who would dare to expect the reinforcements from the Principality of Moxi to arrive as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After appeasing everyone, Hudson directly assigned their respective tasks. Without Sith, the unlucky guy, everyone's responsibilities have been passively increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing everyone's desire to kill Viscount Sith, it got a little more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this unlucky guy knew the seriousness and ran away by himself. Otherwise, an accident happened on the battlefield, and Hudson didn't know how to end it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that killing Sith is very relieved, but once a precedent is set for things like Xiao Qiang, there will be endless troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few nobles who have hatred in this team in Wright County. If they pinch each other on the battlefield, this army will be directly abolished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sending away a group of younger brothers, Hudson also took action. As the head of the legion, he is also not exempt from military obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The branches of the Koslow family, the mountain leader, have a lot of military obligations to bear this time. Even if Hudson used his power for personal gain and reduced his own task quota as much as possible, he would still have to send more than 5,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the family's private army goes to the battlefield, it must be arranged who will follow and who will stay behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are nobility with fiefdoms in each branch, so there is nothing to say. Just pack up your things and go out with the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a clear military obligation, and there is no way to hide. More than 70 people were involved, and Hudson didn't dare to cover up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, you don't have to go to the Principality of Moxi this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a big family affair, someone has to be in charge of staying behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Involving major branches, there are too many affairs that need to be coordinated, and Nelson and Evora may not be able to control them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying behind is just an excuse. The centripetal force of a family connected by blood is far more reliable than that of an ordinary alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in this critical moment of life and death, everyone knows the importance of grouping together. Even if someone wants to do something, he will be hindered by other members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, playing to check and balance Hudson is professional. The children of the family who defected here seem to be reused, but in fact everyone's power is restricted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has selfishness, and Hudson is no exception. The future of going to the Principality of Moxi is uncertain, so he is naturally unwilling to take Baron Redman to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of danger, he can leave others and run away, but he cannot leave Baron Redman alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is not good! Everyone goes out with the army, and I specialize alone, I am afraid it will easily cause...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Baron Redman finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Don't worry, the excuse is that I have already figured it out for you, and I said that I hurt my vitality during cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone has an opinion, let them come and talk to me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, we are not failing to fulfill the kingdom's military obligations. If you don't go to the front line, Nelson will do it for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some trivial matters, even if someone goes to the Governor's Mansion to file a complaint, the provincial government will not delve into this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are a lot of complicated things in the mountain area. I am not in charge of the territory. If you leave with me and something goes wrong, who will be responsible for it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell the truth, the only one he can trust unconditionally is Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others, even brothers, may not want to come back. After all, the foundation of the Mountain Territory is still very memorable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is a troubled time. Even if someone wants to think about it, they know that without Hudson, the Koslow family will not be able to keep this foundation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay! Since you have made arrangements, I will stay behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just to go to the Principality of Moxi, and the journey in the middle is two thousand miles away. Fighting in unfamiliar places is not as simple as suppressing rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, I know that your military ability is good, and you have always acted prudently, so I still want to remind you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy you are facing now is a ferocious army of orcs. Be careful in everything, and don't be a hero on the battlefield! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has many sons, Hudson is the only one who has really emerged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even his eldest son Nelson, whom he is most optimistic about, can only say that he has great ambitions. The problem is that ambition is one thing, but being able to get up is another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who can really counterattack are not only capable and ambitious, but also need luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are many capable people in this world. But most of them fell on the way, and few survived to the end, let alone successfully ascended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic sons like Hudson who have emerged at a young age are rare in the entire Aslant continent. The weight in Baron Redman's heart is naturally different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, father. This is not our war. The main purpose of going to support the Principality of Moxi is to help them stabilize the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, this war should still focus on defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a guest army, our military tasks will not be too heavy. For some of the most important fortresses, the Principality of Moxi will only allow its own troops to garrison them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fall of Fort Augustus was just an accident. They won't make the same mistake a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we don't go out of the city without authorization to fight the orc army, the risk is actually controllable. Even if the line of defense collapses, there is still a chance to retreat. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidence is a very mysterious thing. Even if he has no confidence in himself, he must have confidence in everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persuaded Baron Redman, Hudson's attention quickly shifted to the deployment of troops. The elite must be there, but the left-behind forces cannot be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traveling long distances to rescue, the most important thing is the mobile force, and cavalry is definitely indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just thinking of the pitiful number of horses in the territory gave Hudson a headache. The entire Koslow family added up to barely make up a thousand war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it is impossible for all these horses to be equipped with cavalry. The mounts of knights and gentlemen must be guaranteed first; the horses of signal soldiers and scouts must also be deducted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people must be one person and two horses, and the number of war horses is directly halved. For the remaining horses, Hudson could barely make up a cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking out of the room to relax, looking at the cattle grazing on the hillside in the distance, Hudson suddenly came up with the idea of ​​being a cavalry soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is not a real bull rider. Although the mutant cows in his own territory have strong genes, they can't run like war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called bull cavalry is mainly considered for heavy infantry. Traveling in summer in heavy armor is a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marching without armor, if you encounter an enemy suddenly, you will become light infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
