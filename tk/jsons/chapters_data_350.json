The war had just ended, and everyone was busy taking over the fief, so the Minister of Military Affairs came to the door, and this efficiency was also leveraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's normal to think about it. Things like the dragon's estrus are full of uncertainties. If you don't communicate in advance, if you miss it, you don't know when the next time will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refer to the practice of the Frankish Kingdom. People always prepare the female beasts that need to be bred in advance, and wait for the dragon to go into heat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the kingdom did not come to the door, probably because they did not have time to prepare the female beast. After all, although the dragon's genes are powerful, the female beast's genes are equally critical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The minimum requirement is to be a monster. Even if an ordinary beast is bred with a giant dragon, the potential of the sub-dragon beast born will not be high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it doesn't matter if the monster level is too high, not to mention that the probability of genetic mutation is too high, and the sub-dragon beast's fertility will also be limited, or even directly lose its fertility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, what everyone wants is an army of monsters that can be mass-produced, not a talented cub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the most basic thing for a female animal to be able to give birth. It is best to have one litter and one litter, and the growth cycle should not be too long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these restrictions, the attributes of Warcraft should also be considered. Maxim is a giant fire dragon, so it is undoubtedly the best choice to choose a fire monster to borrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many restrictions, even the great nobles can't handle it for a while. After all, borrowing seeds is also full of uncertainties, and one or two female beasts cannot succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ask him to the living room, I'll be there right away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representing the Kingdom's Minister of Military Affairs to visit in person, it must be taken seriously. The main thing is his Warcraft Legion, which will be there soon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the ability of the Koslow family, God knows how much time it will take to find a suitable female animal to breed with Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rational Hudson would naturally not do such a waste of time and energy. With a kind of dragon in hand, you can wait for everyone to come to your door to discuss cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no free lunch in the world, and there is a price to be paid if you want to borrow seeds. Collecting gold coins is too tacky, and it is easy to hurt feelings, it is better to share the results directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to potential female beasts. After all, the Warcraft Legion has never been better with as many races as possible, and that would add a lot of intangible costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most economical way is to devote the power of the kingdom to cultivate one or two excellent war beasts, and build a monster army based on this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the successful cases, it is basically played like this. Although the Yalong beasts that everyone has cultivated are all kinds of strange, there are only one or two that can be used as mounts for the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing also requires a certain amount of luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The Kingdom of Iberia has done it many times, but so far it has not produced sub-dragon cavalry suitable for the air force. It can only be replaced by giant eagle cavalry and griffin cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly due to the limitation of the dragon's estrus time, the first mating was unsuccessful, and the second mating did not know how long it would take.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the dragon knight's lifespan was exhausted, the giant dragon ran away directly, and the experiment had to be suspended. In the years of owning the dragon knight, no one can say for sure how many times he can experiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The tea is very good. It seems that the Earl is also a person who loves life!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the aristocrats who eat meat as their staple food, tea, which is oily and greasy, has long been a necessity in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to tea tasting, Hudson is an amateur. This kind of drink from overseas is a proper luxury in the continent of Aslante. Only rich nobles are qualified to pick tea varieties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pot of tea brewed in front of me was sent by Isabel, and the tea variety Hudson chose was completely unknown to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't know, since the customer said it is good tea, it is really good tea. Anyway, this meeting is not for drinking tea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Haha... That's natural. I didn't expect that Your Excellency is also a person who understands tea. If you like it, you might as well take some back with you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is so natural, as if he really understands tea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then thank you Earl for your kindness!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I took the liberty to visit, in addition to reminiscing about the past, there is also a major event involving the future development of the kingdom, which needs to be discussed with Your Excellency! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From that serious expression, Hudson understood everything. Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately asked cooperatively, \"I don't know why the Grand Duke is here this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is like that, you can't be too smart. The play that should be performed must go through the process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you personally commanded the troops to participate in this war, and you have a deep understanding of the military strength of the countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially their Warcraft Legion has shown impressive combat effectiveness. I wonder if Your Excellency the Earl has any ideas? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the vigorous development of the Warcraft Legion, there are actually differences within the Kingdom's military. Some people support it, while others are against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have their own reasons, especially after Hudson proposed to build the magic crossbow and magic crystal cannon army, which pushed the controversy to a climax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with monsters that may have accidents at any time, lifeless magic crossbows and magic crystal cannons are obviously much easier to control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now within the Ministry of Military Affairs, an agreement is barely reached: vigorously promote the construction of the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wants to develop the Warcraft Legion well, he must first win the support of Hudson, otherwise the plan will not go ahead at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To tell you the truth, the Warcraft Legion of the major forces is indeed very powerful. In my opinion, once the problem of the cost of Warcraft is solved, the Warcraft Legion will definitely become the mainstream of the mainland army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the Tyrannosaurus Rex of the Frankish Kingdom, with the help of magic potions, only needed seven years from birth to battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pterosaurs were cultivated for a little longer, but not more than ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This growth time, although much higher than that of a war horse, is already acceptable. If the research continues, this time may be further shortened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cost is not considered, they already have the ability to cultivate monsters on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The progress of the other big forces is slightly slower, but the gap is not too big. Perhaps it will be a matter of decades before the popularity of the Warcraft Legion! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These messages are public in the coalition forces. As the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's army, Hudson naturally pays attention to the messages of his allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the authenticity of the news, it is actually not that important. Since Grand Duke Affiero came to the door, it was obvious that the Kingdom wanted to develop the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty and Your Excellency the Earl share the same view, and both believe that the Warcraft Legion will be the mainstream of future wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only the human race that has conducted in-depth research in this area, but many races among other races have formed the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one that has gone the farthest in this field is actually not the Frankish Kingdom, but the ancient elves. Compared with us humans, elves have the natural ability to get close to nature, and it is obviously easier to get close to Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which step they have reached is still unknown for the time being. But what is certain is that the Franks are already preparing to form a large-scale Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected by the kingdom, Charles III had privately announced that he would form eight tyrannosaurus rex legions and five pterosaur legions within five years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number of people in the establishment is unknown, but based on the cards of the first kingdom in the mainland, a legion they form must have at least a few thousand monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Vatican, the Kingdom of Iribia, the Black... and more than a dozen major family powers have similar plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining human race forces have also taken actions secretly, but the progress is not yet obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is seriously behind in this respect. If you don't hurry up to catch up and wait for the major forces to complete this military reform, you will be in big trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the words of Grand Duke Afiero, Hudson cursed shamelessly. Having said so many reasons, it is not for the purpose of growing dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing Wang Guoyi to justice was nothing more than telling him in a subtle way: Don't try to cheat at such a time, it will cause public outrage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if the kingdom forms a monster army, I will definitely support it 100%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that although I am also a magician, I don't know anything about cultivating Warcraft. Even if you want to contribute, you don't know how to start! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson deliberately pretended to be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to knock the stick, but you still have to fight for the initiative. As Minister of Military Affairs, Archduke Efiero is still very busy and has no time to spend time with Hudson, so he immediately cut to the chase and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can definitely help me with this matter. Judging from the monster legions formed by the major forces at present, they are all dominated by sub-dragon beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the seeds for cultivation and research come from giant dragons. As the fourth dragon knight in the mainland, the future of the kingdom rests on you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Hudson's face almost darkened. What does it mean to rely on him? Obviously, it depends on Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the red dragon Maxim who wants to mate with the monster, not Earl Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He hesitated for a while, but in the end he didn't open his mouth to refute. It was just a slip of the tongue, nothing to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is useless to persuade me, the key is to cooperate with the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know that the dragon's estrus is not regular at all. Although theoretically speaking, adult dragons can actively enter estrus, but such successful cases are too few.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the other three dragon knights were unable to convince their own dragon to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a newly promoted dragon knight, I know less about the habits of giant dragons. I am afraid that it will be quite difficult to persuade the red dragon to actively enter the estrus period! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be afraid of \"difficulties\", but afraid of not being able to do it. It doesn't matter if you cheat or buy it, Grand Duke Affiero doesn't care about the process as long as the red dragon contributes the seeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst result is nothing more than waiting for the dragon to go into heat naturally. If it can be opened in advance, it is worth paying a certain price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if you have any difficulties, feel free to mention them. As long as the Kingdom can solve them, we will definitely help you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Efiero rubbed his forehead helplessly and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he got involved with interests, he immediately felt a headache. But this kind of thing can't be refused, after all, it is too difficult to artificially control the dragon's estrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one has thought of drugging secretly, but the problem is that the dragon is not easy to fool! In case the goofing is discovered, it will be a major accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom just wanted to borrow seeds from the dragon, but it wasn't going to make enemies with the dragon. What's more, Hudson, the dragon knight, would definitely not agree to such an immoral thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Grand Duke is serious! It's not that I have difficulties, but that Mr. Maxim, the red dragon, has difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't know how big the appetite of the dragon is, my pasture is almost running out. However, Maxim is very picky eater, he must have fresh cattle and sheep, and they must be raised by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to solve this problem, most of the earldom's land has been turned into his pasture, but it is still not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the earldom is too scattered, the area where the lord's mansion is located is mountainous, and it is still dominated by mining areas, lacking suitable pastures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the territory can be replaced and the scattered fiefs can be gathered together, this problem will be easily solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Maxim is very affectionate, even if it is a borrowed seed, it is his descendant. The offspring born by the monster can't be taken away, but a little bit of thought must be left for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wants to take away the offspring he doesn't like, it's okay, but sufficient compensation must be given. His Excellency the Grand Duke also knows about the giant dragon's hobbies! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson's embarrassed expression, Grand Duke Afiero cursed shamelessly deep in his heart. He is obviously seeking benefits for himself, but he is using the banner of the giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that giant dragons are greedy for money, but to let them sell their \"seeds of life\" for money would be too underestimating the arrogance of giant dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with trading, the dragon obviously prefers to use grabs. For the giant dragon, problems that can be solved with fists have never been a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, regarding the issue of fief replacement, I can only promise to persuade the king as much as possible. But the parliament will probably encounter trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the group of northern nobles, they never cared about the overall situation of the kingdom, and often did ridiculous things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other two troubles, as long as Mr. Maxim doesn't have a big appetite, there shouldn't be any major problems. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inadvertently, Grand Duke Afiero hacked the nobles of the Northland again. Obviously, the royal family has already torn skins with these guys, and the suppression is too lazy to cover up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to act as the opposition in the noble council, but the resolution does not need unanimous support, and some opposition votes are also feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the family that has a relationship with Hudson, everyone else is preparing to join the \"borrowing\" team. At this juncture, everyone will only choose \"trading\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't need to worry too much, my Alpha Kingdom is not what those guys in the North have the final say on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, today is different from the past, the internal disputes alone are enough for them to toss for several years, how can they have the energy to come and make trouble?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next biggest trouble is convincing Mr. Maxim. You must have heard about the arrogance of the giant dragon. If you want to persuade him to agree, it will take several months at the fastest, and you don't know how much trouble you will encounter during the period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this period, the kingdom must first prepare the female beast. After all, we have no experience with dragons in heat. If the duration is too short and you miss the opportunity and want to come back again, you will be in big trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said bitterly.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If there are too many times, he will definitely find problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current aphrodisiac potion is mainly aimed at giant dragons, the duration is too short, and it is not enough to complete the dragon breeding plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom wants to build the Yalong Legion, which is already lagging behind other countries. If they want to catch up in a short time, the only way is to get more female beasts to mate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the giant dragon has strong fighting power, if it has to face hundreds of female beasts in a short period of time, it is estimated that the real dragon king will have weak legs when he comes over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of a vested interest group, Hudson still has a strong sense of belonging to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Kingdom really falls behind in this round of military reforms, there is no telling how much it will cost in the future to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't catch up at this moment, you will be like a fool who still insists on taking the pure infantry route when cavalry is popularized on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the kingdom's research and development capabilities, magic crossbow and magic crystal cannon technology, Hudson has always been skeptical about whether it can catch up to the top level of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the technology catches up, mass production is still a big problem. Importing the core components from the Dwarf Kingdom is the deadliest flaw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top powers in the mainland like the Holy See and the Frankish Kingdom, although they also need to import some parts, they can also make them themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the cost of making it yourself is more expensive than buying dwarves, the production capacity is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there were more alchemists in the southern countries, and their technology went further. What did the kingdom do to catch up in a short time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap is not limited to these, including the magic transformation of transport vehicles during the war, and the technology also comes from the southern powers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The advantages of the northern countries are only the strong folk customs, but in the extraordinary world, these advantages are really insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resisting the extraordinary troops of various countries with flesh and blood, anyone with a little brain knows how hard it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shoot the first bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the emerging coach in this war, if a major foreign war breaks out in the kingdom, especially a war where the enemy is strong and we are weak, there is a high probability that Hudson will lead the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to shirk it. The stronger the ability, the greater the responsibility is not a joke. Otherwise, why would the kingdom give him such a high treatment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things are not prepared in advance. If it really happens, it will be too late to cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the mainland is still in a period of overall balance. The existence of foreign races restricts the internal struggle of the human race. The major forces have no intention of starting a war for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brainwashing work against the Red Dragon must begin. Otherwise, it would be embarrassing when the kingdom had all the female beasts and he hadn't dealt with Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson never doubted the military sensitivity of the nobles of the kingdom. As long as the royal family takes the lead, all parties will definitely choose to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The joint-stock country is like this, where money gives money, and where there are beasts, beasts. In addition to the share of the kingdom's standing army, everyone will also get a share of the cultivated monster mounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for running the Warcraft Legion alone, it's not that Hudson looks down on people, but because of the strength of the kingdom's major families, no one really has the confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the aristocrat's network of relationships is intricate, and it is not ruled out that someone can obtain a World of Warcraft mount from abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the probability of this is very small, at least at this stage it is difficult for a large number of war beasts to flow out. Even if it can be obtained, the price to be paid will not be smaller than supporting the kingdom itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, Pius VII was looking at the newly released map of the mainland with anxiety. This wave provoked the invasion of the orcs, and the Holy See suffered a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alfa Kingdom was indeed hit hard, but it was still far from the expected decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Didn't you say that you have succeeded? Why is Caesar III still alive after so long? Could it be that your plan is to let him live until the end of his life?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Caesar III is alive, the plan against the Alpha Kingdom cannot be implemented. No matter how much internal conflicts are provoked, it is useless. There is no chaos at all if there is a backbone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original partner, the orc was beaten to death, struggling to survive in the crevice. The northern aristocrats who placed high hopes on the Cholera Alpha Kingdom wanted to kill themselves, and the Holy See didn't know where to start if they wanted to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the war is over, the situation in the Alpha Kingdom has stabilized, and Caesar III is still alive and well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, it may take a few years before he can get out of his weakness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, this staunch anti-Holy See kingdom will most likely come out to make trouble again. In the eyes of Pius VII, Charles III and Caesar III were the biggest heretics in the whole continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these two heretics are not easy to deal with, even the Holy See does not dare to take action against them easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation may have changed. The Alpha Kingdom is a big country after all, and it still has some heritage. It is also normal to have some treasures that prolong life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III is still alive for the time being, but his body is already broken. Relying on some treasures to extend life span also has its limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in two or three years, he will be able to hear the news of his death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, it's good to procrastinate like this. If Caesar III died too quickly, everyone would link his death with the assassination case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, all major forces in the mainland will do their best to investigate. Although we have done a covert job and arranged multiple scapegoats, we still cannot guarantee that it will be foolproof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, some heretics still have a certain ability to predict the past and future. Paying a certain price, it is still possible to track us down! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulise hastily explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received the credit for assassinating Caesar III, and had to bear the consequences. No matter how nonsense the reason is, he will make arrangements for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether Caesar III will die after two or three years, we will discuss it later. Anyway, the longer the delay, the more difficult it is to verify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally a task that was forcibly forced, but deep down in his heart, Ulises was extremely resistant. If he really left a loophole, he would 100% become a scapegoat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leaving aside the issue of Caesar III, what about the issue of the great magister of the undead?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your holy hands keep saying that the Earl of Hudson is pretending to be a great undead magister, but the reality is that he has no problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of this incident, we couldn't hold our heads up in the coalition forces, so we had to give up the dominance to the Franks! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because he believed what the intelligence organization said, in order to attack the Alpha Kingdom that day, he confidently revealed the matter of the great magister of the undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that the Alpha Kingdom would be ashamed in front of the coalition forces, but I never thought that the clown would be me in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when he raised this question at this moment, Blake really didn't add insult to injury, but seemed to be helping Ulisse out of a siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to Caesar III's delay in meeting the Lord of Dawn, the small intelligence error is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, there may be another story behind this incident. The people we sent that day saw it with their own eyes: Hudson released undead magic, and it was instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the strength of magic, only the great magister of the undead can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't check it out in the coalition forces, it can only mean that you met the Earl of Hudson himself, and the last time we dealt with us was a great undead magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest increasing the monitoring level of Hudson, and dig out the undead magister hidden behind the scenes as soon as possible, maybe there are other blasphemous organizations hidden in it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse explained with serious political discourse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, there is only one core: everyone is fine, the problem is that the enemy is too cunning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the skill of throwing the pot is so good, no matter how slippery he is, he can't hide it from Pius VII above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all left over from his playing tricks. If he believes so easily, how can he be the Pope?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you are all right, it is my fault. It is right to keep you in the holy mountain for the elderly, and you should not be arranged to go out to perform missions!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Pope's voice fell, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly became solemn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The faces of Blake and Ulisse were even more gloomy and terrifying. It is really wrong to screw things up and blame the enemy, but they have no choice!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of adults, there is no right or wrong, only pros and cons. There are many things that you can only bite the bullet and do even if you know it shouldn't be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, heresy organizations have been really rampant in recent years. In Frank, Iberia... these big countries, they even dare to show their faces publicly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the heretic Charles III is in contact with them, planning to form an arcane academy and invite these guys to give lectures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once their plan succeeds, the achievements of the ancestors' painstaking efforts for thousands of years will be destroyed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that it is still necessary to change the topic of Dafa at the critical moment. Compared with the forthcoming Arcane Academy, the previous ones can only be regarded as pediatrics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Bishop Sauron's words came out, Pius VII couldn't care less about continuing to curse. If the truth-seeking Arcane Academy really appeared, the impact on theocracy can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The necromancers, wizards, arcanists, fortune tellers who have been hunted down by them for many years... will all revive and become active on the mainland again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous territory, after completing the personnel adjustment, the first high-level meeting of the territory also quietly kicked off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good leader, Hudson will naturally not make any distinctions. The \"important ministers\" who were sent abroad were also called back to participate in the meeting, and jointly offered advice and suggestions for the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The main purpose of calling everyone here this time is to discuss the future development of the Earldom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is an important manager of the territory. Before formulating a development plan, I want to hear your opinions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, everyone looked a little excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eligible to participate in the formulation of the future development plan of the territory, undoubtedly entered the core decision-making level of the territory, which obviously regarded them as \"our own people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was also very helpless to make such a decision. Winning people's hearts is second, the key is to develop the territory now, he must rely heavily on the people present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of loyalty, as long as they can serve the territory now and don't betray immediately, then let's count them as loyal ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some information is passed on occasionally, Hudson can turn a blind eye and close one eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development route of the territory is too obvious, and it cannot be hidden from the experienced old fox at all. It is doomed not to keep it secret, so simply keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original mountain collar was a flat boat, but now the mountain collar is a luxury ship. Also sailing in the sea, the ability to resist risks has been greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can still withstand a little wind and waves. Even if the outside world knew about his development plan, it would be difficult to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, our territory is too scattered. To formulate a reasonable development plan, it can only be carried out according to the actual situation of each region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the limited resources of the territory, it is impossible to take into account multiple aspects. The best option is to exchange land with nearby lords and gather the fiefdoms together as much as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Andrea first proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the original intelligence organization, after a new round of personnel adjustments, Hudson was appointed as the lord of Xueyue City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be reused, but it is also far away from the center of power. But he can't say anything yet. After all, the intelligence organization is in his hands. It can only be said that the basic structure has been completed, and it is not efficient at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Information is all effective, and if it cannot be obtained immediately, it will lose its due meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not Andrea's responsibility that the development of the intelligence organization lags behind. After all, it is not a matter of overnight if you want to install spies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that Hudson does not have so many talents in his hands, so he uses them for intelligence. Most of the people sent out to collect intelligence are not very capable of management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the spies placed by other nobles in the territory, they are not at the same level at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention entering the decision-making level of others, there are very few people who can sneak into the camp of the old and big aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, their task is just to collect major developments in various places. It's all news on the surface, and more in-depth information, that's something I dare not even think about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no result that can be presented, naturally there is no right to speak. It is already considered lucky to be able to get a high position outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But no matter how good Xueyue City is, it can't change the fact that it is far away from the Lord's Mansion. And it's not so far away, directly out of the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, one radish and one pit. Although most of Hudson's territory is in the southeastern province, there are still a few enclaves that have left the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's always difficult to mix outsiders. If it weren't for his limelight, he might have been attacked by various conspiracies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to complete the territory handover smoothly is because the local snakes are afraid that he will run over secretly to beat Sap. Similar things happen from time to time in the aristocratic world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that a certain nobleman is unhappy, or has an enmity with a certain nobleman, he will lead someone to beat him up in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as no one is killed, even if someone finds out and takes revenge, at worst, he will be beaten back again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The methods are indeed a bit out of date, but this is also part of the noble struggle. As the saying goes, the more high-end the fight, the more unpretentious the means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, I have already made arrangements for this matter, but the coordination cycle may be relatively long. In a short time, everyone still needs to develop the territory well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a territory replacement, the value of a prosperous territory and a depressed territory is not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need now is to formulate a short-term development plan. The time period can be determined according to the actual situation of each region, and there is no need to pursue synchronization across regions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only two prerequisites, namely:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    1. For enclaves far away from mountainous territories, strive to develop the territory in the shortest possible time; the core area of ​​the territory pursues long-term development;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second, control budget input. The plan must be carried out according to the actual situation in each place, and cannot be divorced from the reality, and the funds invested should not be too much. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said frankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that he wants to replace the fief is not a secret in the kingdom at all, and naturally there is no need to conceal it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all part of the dragon planting plan deal, and the following political public relations are just a formality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the main nobles in the kingdom do not object, the rest will not be able to make waves. What really needs communication and coordination is the parties involved in the land exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a big problem, as long as they take advantage of a small advantage when changing land, and then subsidize everyone's moving expenses, the matter will basically be solved.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you don't know the situation, you naturally have no right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory development meeting that was agreed upon will inevitably turn into a special show for the heads of various places in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comprehensive development plans of all people can be summed up in two words—conservative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the plans are mediocre. Those who grow potatoes grow potatoes, and those who grow rye grow rye, almost all planing in the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if raising livestock is proposed, it is to meet the needs of arable land, and by the way, to meet the meat needs of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those with a bit of an economic mind just proposed to grow flax by themselves. This thing is very popular, flaxseed is used to extract vegetable oil, and flax stalks can be spun for weaving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Economic development is something only cities need to consider. It is enough for small towns in the countryside to do a good job in agricultural production, and at most they need to maintain and repair roads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development plans of the only two cities, or three cities, are quite conservative. Copying a law from a neighbor and strictly implementing it is considered a measure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is quite standard, nothing new. I can't find any bright spots, and I can't find any major problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without experience in urban governance, the best way is to copy your neighbors. It is necessary to develop everyone to develop together, and it is necessary to make it bad for everyone to do it together. As long as they reach the same level, they will not fall behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not in a hurry to comment on the content of the law. These are the governance experiences summed up by good neighbors. Perhaps there is an even more bizarre story behind the seemingly bizarre decree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Copying it may not necessarily achieve brilliant results, but at least it can guarantee that the territory will not be messed up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to being unique and directly establishing a new political system, Hudson prefers to improve the original political system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, this is the compiled territory development plan, please have a look!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Kane has handed over the sorted documents. On the front page is the \"Draft Three-Year Plan for Territory Development\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time period can be extended by three years, obviously it will not be an enclave. Starting from the determination to change the land, the requirements for the development of the enclave are: to see benefits quickly, and stability is paramount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reform does not exist. After the territory replacement deal is concluded, a major relocation will be carried out. The original social structure has all been disrupted, and everything has to start from scratch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running to carry out reforms at this moment is purely a waste of administrative resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the people in the territory were basically composed of serfs and there were not many free people, a relocation of this scale would definitely cause a big mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three-year plan is very simple, and it is recorded on only one page, so it is doomed that there will be no specific planning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, it can be divided into two modules: economic and military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for high-profile politics, this group of people is not qualified to get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, Hudson himself is mixed with others, and there are really not many political issues to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the political system of the entire kingdom, his right to speak is actually not very high, except for the military field, basically he has nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics and diplomacy, that is what the ministers in the capital need to consider. Everyone has their own economy, and lords everywhere have enough autonomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the king can collect some taxes from the local governments, the tax rates and types of taxes are fixed, and most places still use the old tax system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to charge an extra copper coin, you have to get the approval of the noble council. Unless it is a time of war, there will basically not be a pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military: Continue to improve the reserve level system, and gradually reduce the size of the standing army to less than 3,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Establish a 500-man bow and crossbow troop within three years, mainly equipped with magic crossbows; establish a thousand-man knight order to lay the foundation for the formation of the Warcraft Knight Order in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, in terms of military development, the Mountain Territory is also on a path similar to that of the nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind of war mode with large armies and large numbers of people, accompanied by the decline of the orc empire, is likely to be difficult to appear again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around the Alpha Kingdom, there are no big alien forces at all. For a long time to come, if a conflict breaks out with the outside world, it will be a human civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic war with a lot of constraints. Massacres seldom happen, and we cannot hope that in the civil war, everyone will be able to fight the enemy to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The era when serfs were given weapons and they could go to the battlefield and fight the enemy to the death will never return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the new war mode, if you continue to let serfs go to the battlefield, there will be a high probability of \"three braves\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in an aristocratic war, it doesn't matter who wins and who loses the serf or the serf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they win the battle, at most they will be rewarded with a few meals of wine and meat; if they meet a stingy lord, they may have to continue eating black bread that can smash people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The general environment is such that Hudson dare not make big moves. The most important thing is that serf soldiers really can't beat extraordinary troops, even if they are well-trained, they will suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that an extraordinary force hadn't been established yet, he would have planned to abolish the national reserve system, and only select those with cultivation talent to train them from an early age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly due to the limitation of productivity, it is impossible to equip magic crossbows on a large scale, otherwise, even an army composed of ordinary people can cause certain damage to the Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is in the defense of the city. If there is an encounter in the wild, with the power of the current magic crossbow, it still cannot stop the charge of the knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Economically, the development plan of the Mountain Territory is simpler. To sum it up in one sentence: \"Great land reclamation, digging canals, and developing the industrial economy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no specific content. The first two are very straightforward, and it is clear at a glance what this is doing, and the development of the industrial economy in the future can only be explored slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Up to now, the pillar industry of the Mountain Territory is steel. Regardless of whether it is the pots and pans produced, or the heads of swords and guns, they are all inseparable from steel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The oil industry created by Hudson earlier, due to the large increase in population, finally became self-use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extend the industrial chain, which is also established under the self-sufficient lord economic system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Developing commerce is pure nonsense. The largest group in the territory is serfs, followed by orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Free people plus nobles, there are only a few thousand people in total. With this little purchasing power, the mining potential is really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current trading subjects are still nobles. Unless the serf system was broken, it would be difficult for industry and commerce to develop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are organizations similar to the July Society that shout the slogan \"Down with the nobles and liberate the serfs\", they are all classified as cult groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the aristocratic group, Hudson naturally wouldn't foolishly jump out and kill himself. Even if political reform is to be carried out, it is a matter of the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention all the subordinates, they are all masters who have received traditional education, and each of them is a staunch supporter of the current system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After briefly reading it, Hudson said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing such an answer, everyone was very surprised. All the plans were discussed together by them, covering almost all major matters in the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a short time, it is not easy to come up with an outline, and no one can figure out the specific implementation details so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please show the earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane said nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a laborer, and the status is also divided into high and low. Kane, who has faintly become the head of the staff, has to be the first bird at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The development of the territory is inseparable from the population. You should know how high the land limit of the earldom is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reclaiming the swampland and Salam, the total area of ​​the territory definitely exceeds 40,000 square kilometers. Even if half of the land is used as arable land, it can feed millions of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is our current population?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How big is the gap between them? You should know in your minds. Why is there no policy to encourage births? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of feudal lords, if you want to increase the population, it mainly depends on the attitude of the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the nobles are willing to spend money and food to support them, everyone can live with confidence and boldness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era without entertainment and contraceptive facilities, making people at night is the eternal mainstream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marriage rate, what is that?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the age is not matched, the officials of the Lord's Mansion will directly give the allocation object. Serfs didn't even have the right to personal freedom, so naturally they didn't have the right to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the free people, there are not many in the territory, and it doesn't matter whether they are active or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, we have already announced the release of birth control, so there is no need to repeat it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane bit the bullet and responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Encouraging childbearing\", this is the first time he has heard of this word. According to tradition, when the lord needs to increase the population, he will issue an announcement to release the birth control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After that, as long as a newborn is born, the Lord's Mansion will increase the corresponding material ration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the mountainous territory is also playing in this way, adopting the traditional material rationing system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that in order to encourage land reclamation, Hudson took part of the land proceeds to share with the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who get up early, as long as they are honest and willing to work, now have some extra income, and they can be regarded as wealthy households among serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for letting go of childbirth, it seems that since Hudson moved into the mountain territory, he has never restricted everyone from making humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you put it on the earth in the previous life, the population fertility rate of the mountainous territory, it is the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, due to medical conditions, while the birth rate is high, the death rate is also high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These are not enough, relying solely on natural population growth, this rate is too slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must come up with more active population incentive policies, for example: provide better medical facilities for the citizens, or provide some in-kind rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can we meet the needs of medical resources in the territory with only a few priests?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priest training period is too long, and it is impossible to train a large number of priests in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is to train pharmacists. They don't need to be too proficient in alchemy, as long as they understand pharmacology, can mix some herbs, and can deal with some minor daily problems. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words fell into everyone's ears, no less than a thunderbolt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pharmacists are not popular in the continent of Aslante. In the era when the Holy See was prosperous, they were classified as heretics, and they were caught and sent to the stake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See is not behind, under the influence of traditional concepts, pharmacists are still a partial profession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly high-ranking nobles who don't need pharmacists to serve them. There are priests for injuries and illnesses. Even if you don't want to receive magic treatment, there are more advanced magic potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, it is so hierarchical. The magic potions used by great people are orthodox, but ordinary pharmacists are heretical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, all this is caused by interests. In order to monopolize medical resources, the pastor deliberately discredited and suppressed competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See is powerful, Hudson would never dare to do such a deviant thing. But this is the Alpha Kingdom, a place where priests want to look at nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priests in the territory may be dissatisfied, but there will be no major disturbances. Even if they don't want to do it, the family behind them will let them be honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The right to speak is only qualified for the great pastor. Those in Hudson's territory are all low-ranking priests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't want to do it, there are a lot of people out there waiting to take their place. Just to meet the medical needs of nobles, not many people are really needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, although this change has had an impact on the status of priests, the overall impact is not great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The declining pharmacists, even if they revived in the mountains, will only be able to provide medical services to serfs for a long time to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic gentlemen cannot be trusted with these guys. Their current competitors are still those magicians who are proficient in alchemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, as long as there is no war. The nobles don't have much demand for medical resources, and every master knight is in excellent health.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Physical problems occurred, and that was also in old age. Usually when the old disease relapses, it is time to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the healing technique used by priests and gentlemen to stimulate the potential of life is a life-threatening talisman for the nobles in their later years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can live a few more days if you die, and there is a high probability that you will be sent away directly after treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, there are not many good people among these out-of-the-ordinary pharmacists. Letting them in may cause trouble. Especially their reputation, maybe they will attract...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the administrative officer Jacob finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Whether they are good people or not, I just need them to train more pharmacists for the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you're worried about them, send someone to keep an eye on them. What you need is to help me solve problems, not simply ask questions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the wind and rain outside, I, the earl, are in front, and you don't need to bear it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the benefits, Hudson feels that some risks can be taken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The church in the Kingdom is in disarray, and has long been dismantled by the nobles. The bishop of the Mountain Territory was appointed by Hudson himself, and it is purely a decoration politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This caused the dissatisfaction of the Holy See, so let them be dissatisfied. The boss of his family is a heretic in the eyes of the Holy See, and there is no problem for the younger brother to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he started his family by killing the cavalry of the Holy See and gaining the glory of political correctness. Hudson didn't mind letting his anti-Holy see mark deepen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing the day's work, Hudson returned to the gentle township again. I have to admit that Isabel, who is proficient in singing, dancing, chess, calligraphy and painting, is indeed very attractive. He has been staying here recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time went by, Hudson also felt a sense of crisis in his heart. Especially the letter from his fiancée made him feel dizzy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, he assured Melissa that he had nothing to do with Isabel. In this state, he has no way to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, he admired his father-in-law, the red flag at home did not fall, and the colorful flags outside fluttered. There was even a pass where Hudson found Orlan bringing his lover home to play with his wife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same thing, Hudson can't guarantee that he can do it himself. At the very least, his ability to coax women is completely inferior to that of his father-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can attract women is brought by Maxim. The identity of a dragon knight is born with a halo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe she felt something, Isabel, who was lying in his arms, suddenly turned around, stared at Hudson and asked, \"Hudson, what are you worried about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is there anything that can stump you, a dragon knight? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's nothing serious, it's just a little trouble in the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I plan to train a group of pharmacists to provide better medical security for the people in the territory. Now I am worried about the collective opposition of the pastors in the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said flicking to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible to tell the truth. If the jar of vinegar is overturned, it will be difficult to obtain this top-level enjoyment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, Isabel served him too comfortably, and Hudson didn't want to destroy the current relationship between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't consider external influences, and it's just the pastors' objection, you send someone to communicate with them in private, and everyone should give you face, the Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the suspicious eyes that Isabel does not believe the reason given by Hudson. It's just that, as a smart person, she didn't expose it directly, but instead took it as real to help make suggestions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Hudson secretly complained. Deep in my heart, I couldn't help but think that it's better for women to be a little bit stupid. It's really not easy to fool a woman who is too smart!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Isabel is very virtuous, but is this what a lover should have? It was obvious that this was a pretense for him to show, in order to magnify his inner guilt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If she really had the same status and played tricks, she guessed that ten Melissas would not be her opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are not so many ifs. Some things are born with something, but it is impossible to have it without it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, men still have the opportunity to change their lives against the sky on the battlefield and complete the leap of status and class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Women want to make a leap, and they can only choose potential stocks and invest in advance before men make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: for a potential stock like Hudson, it is only possible to marry a singer before he gets the title, or when he has just got the title and is poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson at that time could not have caught Isabel's eyes at all. The little nobles who were fascinated by her were able to line up to the capital from here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marriage with the Holliser family was also the result of Oran, who was still a Viscount, having a unique vision and investing in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must be known that when the two sides started contact, Hudson was still a young baron, at most, his military strength was stronger than that of ordinary barons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing an olive branch offered by an established expensive brand, the Koslow family, who didn't know that Hudson could rise rapidly, couldn't think of rejecting it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the dust settled, Hudson started his real rise. It can be called a classic case of perfect timing and betting on potential stocks in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hmm! That's a good idea, I'll arrange it later!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While talking, Hudson has already kissed her...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Add monthly tickets, the more the better! always love you Haiyue\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I don't want to cause trouble.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson was taken aback by a sentence that cut off the beginning and the end, and asked anxiously: \"Hudson, you don't know how to carry out religious reforms, do you?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Religious Reformation\", this is a new term popular in the continent of Aslante after the decline of the power of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who dares to carry out religious reforms is a well-known hero on the mainland. If ordinary nobles go to join in the fun, there is a high probability that they will not survive three episodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently the most active religious system reformers on the mainland are Charles III and Caesar III. The former wanted to pull the Holy See down from the altar, while the latter touched the foundation of the Holy See's existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The anti-Holy See's political correctness can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the Alpha Kingdom, and Caesar III has made great contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the important appointments of the kingdom and the canonization of nobles, you will know that the first prerequisite is to be against the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not about shouting slogans, but about taking practical actions. The kingdom's nobles had contacts with the Holy See, which could only be done in secret. On the surface, the Holy See had become a taboo in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He reached out and patted Nelson on the shoulder, Hudson laughed loudly and said, \"Don't worry, Nelson. I do things with a sense of proportion and know what not to touch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is really necessary to carry out religious reform, it is a proposal to His Majesty the great king, and it will be carried out with the nobles of the whole country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time it is just to train a few pharmacists to solve the problem of the serfs' difficulty in getting medical treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the priests refuse to agree, then let them provide medical services to the serfs for free. If you kill someone and get beaten to death, just don't come to me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a strong sense of threat, Nelson was very worried about whether he would be typed out if he really said it in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The religious influence in the Mountain Territory is not strong, mainly because it is a new territory, and the power of the church has no time to expand here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the church is the church after all, even if it was split up by the nobles in the Alpha Kingdom, it is still a huge group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you offend these people, it will become a big problem for you to seek medical treatment after being injured. With the technology at hand, the senior priest still has a high status in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are you sure there will be no problems if you do this?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all on the same boat. If something happens to Hudson, he, the eldest brother, will certainly not escape being purged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for picking up the ready-made and directly inheriting the title, let's go to sleep, there will be everything in the dream. In reality, the Koslow family without Hudson would not be able to keep this foundation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I just received the news that the Frankish Kingdom's Arcane Academy has officially recruited students.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the regular magic, knight, and alchemy majors, many weird majors have been added to the subjects offered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: For the first time in the magic major, undead magic is included in the teaching scope, and there are also wizards, arcanists, fortune tellers...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that His Majesty is also very interested in this, and is currently discussing with the Mage Association. If it goes well, these majors will be added to the Kingdom Academy of Magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these generous efforts, I trained a few low-level pharmacists, which is nothing at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plan before acting, but his code of conduct. If there is no boss in front, he will not easily touch the sensitive nerves of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are really entangled, even if you are not afraid, the development of the territory will be greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then I will go and talk to them, if there is no external interference, there should be no big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, Hudson. Father asked me to remind you, pay attention to restraint recently, and don't make any illegitimate children at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has approached the Earl of Oran to formally discuss your marriage with Miss Melissa. The Holliser family is about to move, and you must get married before then! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. Is he such an unreliable person?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Play is fun, business still needs to be distinguished. Although it's not a big deal for a nobleman to have a few illegitimate children, it's still very rude to do this before the wedding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this also reminded Hudson that he should really restrain himself. In any case, the face of the fiancée still has to be given.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson is very grateful to his father-in-law. It is the flower that his old man plays, so Hudson has less pressure on this aspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this is not an exception. The late Duke of Cavadia had illegitimate children before his wedding. When he was young, he even declared to the outside world: This is true love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar strange love affairs in the kingdom. Almost every great noble has more or less legends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not sure whether it is true or not, but the number of illegitimate children in the aristocratic circle is indeed quite a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you set your sights on the Southern Continent, the aristocrats over there will be even more exaggerated. In order to pursue excitement, people have played with men and women... In addition to insisting on keeping the blood pure, its excitement is comparable to that of a romantic city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one day the aristocratic group declines, Hudson thinks it must be from the hands of these illegitimate children. Except for the nobles, only these people have the opportunity to get in touch with the most advanced knowledge of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In many cult organizations, illegitimate children of nobles can be seen. Everything is for the sake of profit, not reconciled to the fact that their identity has not been seen in the light, and there are not a few who choose to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these pioneers all ended up miserable. Such embarrassing things, the aristocrats with good face will never admit it, and usually deal with it directly as a cult member.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is more likely that the new nobles will replace the old nobles. At most, just change a noun, and the essence will not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Hudson's suggestion, the three-year plan was smoothly added to encourage childbearing. Not empty slogans, but actual incentives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the inherent allocation of living materials, from now on, the first child will be rewarded with five pounds of meat, the second child will be rewarded with ten pounds of meat, and the third child will be rewarded with fifteen pounds of meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, there are irregular animal milk subsidies. As for the specific milk, it depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current number of livestock in the territory, it is still impossible to provide milk to all the children in the territory, and can only occasionally distribute some to make up for the lack of nutrition of infants and young children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, maternity leave has also been taken out as a matter of course. Although it is only one and a half months, it is a great progress in this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, I hadn't heard of maternity leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is okay to produce during the slack period, the lord does not need so much labor, and it is okay to rest at home for a few days;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't proposed it himself, everyone would never have thought of maternity leave. After all, there is no such thing as a \"holiday\" these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not just maternity leave, but no leave at all. Whether the serfs take a rest depends purely on whether there is work in the field, or on the mood of the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, in well-developed territories, serfs have more rest. If you encounter a territory that is under development and construction, it will be difficult to have a rest time all year round.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long to rest depends entirely on God's mood. In places like the southeastern provinces, where there is plenty of rain, it is normal to rest for ten or twenty days in a row during the rainy season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only advantage is: no need to work overtime. Fully adhere to the work and rest law of \"work at sunrise, rest at sunset\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to solve the problem of raising children, Hudson also instructed his subordinates to improve the childcare system, to be precise, to further improve the Baojia system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the original basis, Baojia Chief has an additional duty: persuading to have children. This time the rules are much more gentle, there is no fixed task target, but if there are more children in the jurisdiction, they will be rewarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each A shall have women who are dedicated to take care of infants and young children, and the specific number shall be determined according to the number of infants and young children. On this basis, each insurance company has at least one midwife who is responsible for helping deliver babies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for medical insurance, it is a pity that the training of pharmacists has not yet started, and there is really no way to popularize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Pastor, just ignore it. These guys are indeed highly efficient in treating diseases, but the probability of directly taking people away is not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The average life expectancy in Aslante is less than thirty-five years old, and the medical system with priests at its core must definitely bear the main responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, except for such special occasions on the battlefield, most nobles are sick in normal times, and most people prefer to go to a magician to prepare potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the professional quality of this group of people is also very average, and the curative effect is not so guaranteed, as long as they don't drink the medicine that stimulates the body's potential, they won't die directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why many priests study magic potions in private. After all, if you are always playing krypton life therapy, sooner or later, you will persuade all the customers to leave with your strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all for the time being. When new problems arise later, we will try to solve them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, territorial governance is a process in which problems continue to arise and problems are solved. All systems are gradually perfected after going through one problem after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development plan has not yet been implemented, but the big wedding has been put on the agenda first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is in a hurry, it's mainly because the Holliser family can't wait. After confirming that the strategic center of gravity moved to the north, they started the relocation work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current progress, in a few months, the Earl of Oran will go north to preside over the overall situation. Before that, it would be good for everyone to arrange the marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, once the Holliser family moves, Hudson will have to travel thousands of miles to take people to the north to meet the relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention wasting a lot of time, the increased overhead alone is enough to make Hudson feel pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, the budget for Hudson's wedding exceeds one hundred thousand gold coins. And it's just an ordinary standard for marriage between big nobles, the extravagant style of nobles is vividly reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is Hudson spending a lot on this side, but the Holliser family on the other side will only spend even more. Anyway, the bride price prepared by the Koslow family is definitely not as much as the dowry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the face of the two families, and no one will be stingy in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with it specifically, the Koslow family is completely blind. The marriage between the nobles is not to say participation, even if they were guests in the past, they could only stay in the corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Holliser family sent someone to help, otherwise the corresponding etiquette specifications were mistaken, and the society would die!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is Hudson busy, but members of the entire Koslow family are not idle. A group of elders from various branches rushed over from all over to help Zhang Luo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Completely overemphasized the scene, Hudson made a slight comment on this, but was caught and criticized by Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was really hard to resist, Hudson simply chose not to see. Pay attention to it, after all, this grand scene is also the highlight moment in Baron Redman's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to be more decent, he even passed on the title in advance. There is no other way, the earl's father is better than the baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the elders of the major families retire, they will choose to pass the title to the next generation in advance. In principle, this is not allowed, but for the great nobles, it is still no problem to open a back door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is for the sake of face, which makes Hudson very speechless. But as the person involved, he really couldn't refuse everyone's kindness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Baron Redman writing the invitation with great interest, Hudson really wanted to remind him that no one would look at this thing carefully, and just arrange his subordinates to handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally held back, such a good opportunity, not to show off to relatives and friends, reckoning that he would hold back something wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, who else do you think is missing from these invitations?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this voice, Hudson's scalp tingled. There are not many other things in the Koslow family, but the number of relatives is very large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just his own family members, Hudson can't recognize them all now, let alone relatives and friends who are far away from each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, don't forget His Majesty the King and all the great nobles in the kingdom. For others, please check with your uncles slowly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, there is no need to invite the Lochnard family. The other four big families in the Northland don't have a good relationship with me, so I don't need to invite them at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson bit the bullet and responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How to write the king's invitation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Redman asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This question belongs to the blind area of ​​knowledge, including Hudson himself. Anyway, he knew that the big nobles were getting married, so he would send invitations to the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III will definitely not come in person, but there is a high probability that the royal family will send an important member to come to congratulate him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Alpha royal family wants to invite, but even the Moxi royal family cannot be left out. The circle of contacts that has been expanded with great difficulty cannot be easily lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't know, I have never seen anyone send an invitation to the king!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Write it according to the normal invitation letter. If you are worried, you can ask the Holliser family. They should have experience. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied as a matter of course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The news of Hudson's wedding came out, reminding his son that it was time to start a family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the top family in the mainland, Crown Prince Caesar has been a favorite since birth, and there are many people who want to marry him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if unequal status is excluded, the range of choices is wide. It is precisely because there is too much room for choice that it actually drags things down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Crown Prince of the Alpha Kingdom, this marriage is doomed, full of political factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the outbreak of the orc invasion war, Caesar III did not make up his mind. After such a delay, the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An experience that was supposed to be a military achievement, unexpectedly exposed his shortcomings to his son who was almost perfect in the eyes of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter was settled by Caesar III, but it is an indisputable fact that the crown prince's evaluation in the eyes of the outside world has plummeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blessings are unparalleled, but misfortunes never come singly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal abilities are questioned. Political marriages often give more consideration to the power behind them, and the ability of the parties is a secondary factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, at this juncture, the strength of the Alpha Kingdom has also been severely damaged, and it will not be able to recover without rest for more than ten or twenty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If that's all, Crown Prince Caesar is still a high-quality marriage partner. Originally, the investment in marriage is the future, and it is not a loss to wait ten or twenty years to obtain a strong ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in the international competition, the Alpha Kingdom has shown signs of decadence. Not only is it lagging behind the countries in the south economically, but it is also lagging behind in military technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many factors are superimposed together, and the marriage value of Crown Prince Caesar will inevitably decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Caesar III planned to marry the Kingdom of Franks, and the two great powers of the South and the North echoed each other, but now he can't speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I just received news that civil strife broke out in the Warhammer Kingdom. At present, we don't have much information, and we are temporarily unable to determine where the situation will develop!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the severely injured Alpha Kingdom needs most is time. The turmoil in the Warhammer Kingdom at this time is bound to stir up the situation in the North Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what happens next, it will be a disaster for the Alpha Kingdom. Even if the best opportunity comes to your door, you can't grasp it if you don't have enough strength in your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stay neutral and wait and see. For a long time to come, we will not be able to interfere in foreign affairs!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Caesar III couldn't help but sigh. Faced with such a change, there are not many options left for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has made up his mind to marry the Principality of Moxi. The two countries have been turned into \"bad brothers and bad brothers\" by the war, and the situation is a little bit better than that of the Warhammer Kingdom. At this time, they just hold together to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took until now to make up my mind, mainly because the problems faced by the Principality of Moxi were more serious than the situation in the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone borrowed money together to survive, and walked on the verge of bankruptcy. Caesar III knew better than the outside world how big the financial hole of the Principality of Moxi was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected in his hands, he can easily conclude that the Principality of Moxi at this moment has embarked on the road of repaying the old with the new.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a \"debt repayment tax\" is introduced, they will not collect much tax until production generally resumes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a choice, Caesar III is definitely unwilling to choose an in-law full of \"trouble\" for his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that at this point, he can't care so much anymore. No matter how troublesome the Principality of Moxi is, it is also one of the important countries in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to quickly stabilize the situation in the Northern Continent and not give other human forces a chance to intervene, the two join forces is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, after contacting all the large and medium-sized nobles in the kingdom, we have initially reached an agreement on the issue of building the Warcraft Cavalry Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is highly motivated. At present, we have recruited 586 female animals. After screening, there are only 317 females left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number is still growing, and those who have the conditions are forming animal traps and doing their best to build the Warcraft Cavalry Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson has also coordinated, and there is no problem. Let's see when his red dragon can enter the estrus period! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order for this plan to proceed smoothly, he, the Minister of Military Affairs, was exhausted. In a short period of time, it is not so easy to coordinate the relationship between dozens of nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, no matter how much he did, he still could not satisfy Caesar III. More than three hundred female beasts seemed to be a lot, but they actually came from multiple races, and they were all low-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are no middle-level and high-level Warcraft Kingdoms, but these races with high intelligence are not suitable for breeding beasts at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Warcraft Cavalry Legion\", just by hearing the name, you know that the scale is not small. If you want to scale up in a short period of time, it is doomed to force ripening manually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the issue of input cost, the ripening magic potion used on a large scale is obviously not a high-end product, and the side effects must not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay for the female beasts to be low-level, but the key is that after subdividing them into details, the number of the same kind of monsters is actually not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these magical beasts are very fertile and can produce litter by litter, if they want to scale up, it will take time to settle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering possible accidents in the middle, we still don't know when we can really produce results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have already said hello to the Mage Association, they will send people to help. Now send these female beasts to the mountain collar, so as not to miss the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aphrodisiac potions are also prepared, in case the red dragon's estrus period is not within the year that Earl Hudson said, maybe it can still be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is for Earl Hudson to decide for himself. Don't make up your own mind and offend the dragon to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister, for the Earl of Hudson's wedding, you will go there on behalf of the royal family, and communicate the relevant details in depth by the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason why the Kingdom is so eager to recruit female beasts is the news provided by Hudson: the red dragon Maxim's estrus may be at the end of the year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a \"possibility\" has kept the kingdom busy, which is enough to prove that everyone attaches great importance to this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Moxi, news of Hudson's wedding came, and the impact it caused was no less than that in the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is second that everyone has resisted the gun together. The key is that the Mosi people also miss Maxim's waist. There is no way, the seeds of the dragon are so sought-after.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the group of monsters, there are indeed some that can rival the dragon in single combat power. However, these equally talented and powerful races do not have the talent to be a stallion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for giant dragons, which can cross races and release their own seeds as much as they want, most of the other warcraft aesthetics are very specific.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is occasional interracial reproduction, it is only a very small number and does not have universal representation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of forming the Warcraft Legion, compared with the research of the Alpha Kingdom, the Principality of Moxi has actually gone further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, most of the research they conducted was theoretical research, and even if there were experiments, it was a small-scale breeding of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the results, let's not mention them. If there is a big result, it won't be so badly beaten by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Two months later, Marshal Hudson will have a big wedding. This is a good opportunity. I plan to go there myself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as George finished speaking, there was an uproar immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there are too many things involved in your personal visit, and according to the etiquette process, you should go to the capital to visit the host Caesar III first, and the time can't be arranged!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg hurriedly persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's visit is a big event. After a set of cumbersome procedures, let's not say that he is going to attend a wedding. Maybe the time will be next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right. It is indeed too late to set off at this time. So be it, Count Renato, and go there for me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, find an opportunity to communicate with Caesar III, and test whether we can join their Warcraft Legion plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Warhammer Kingdom is in civil strife at the moment. Otherwise, if they join, the probability of the Alpha Kingdom agreeing will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a big problem. In the past few years, the Alpha Kingdom has been focusing on the issue of fighting the orcs, and there is no energy to distract them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now starting from scratch, to build a Warcraft Legion, the problems faced cannot be solved in a day or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our joining, although we can't guarantee how much earlier this time will be, at least we can help them share the cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs seized the time to contact the northern countries and strive for everyone to reach an agreement on this issue. If you want to catch up with the southern countries, joining forces is the best choice, and Caesar III should not refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato, this time your mission is heavy. If the Alpha Kingdom rejects us, then you have to find a way to convince Earl Hudson to help us secretly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing the orc invasion, the principality of Moxi attached great importance to the development of military affairs, and it was almost to the point of madness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing the power of the Warcraft Cavalry, George came up with the idea of ​​building his own Warcraft Cavalry Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the gap between ideas and reality is always so great. The Principality of Moxi, whose vitality was severely injured, was clearly at a disadvantage in this arms race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to join hands with the Alpha Kingdom at this moment is also a choice of last resort. But when there are better options, no one is willing to give up the dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Principality is out of money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the tax collection situation in various places, the result is quite unsatisfactory. Many noble lords used the war bonds issued by the Principality to offset their taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the credibility of the bond, and the tax department cannot refuse this kind of offsetting behavior. It is expected that there will be a huge deficit in this year's fiscal revenue, and it is very likely that there will be difficulties in the next bond redemption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, it is difficult for the Ministry of Finance to squeeze out a large amount of funds. So in the next…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing George's face darken, the Chancellor of the Exchequer also looked helpless. It wasn't that he wanted to pour cold water on the king, it was because the financial hole of the Principality of Moxi was too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the war, not only is the government in short supply, but most of the nobles in the Principality have financial problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is using war bonds to offset taxes, which is actually a last resort. The territory is in the midst of a waste of time, and the life of the nobles is not easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other taxes are easy to say, if there is no tax, there will be no tax. Only the \"repayment tax\" is apportioned according to the fiefdom, regardless of whether the territory is profitable or not, it has to be paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is still good to be able to use war bonds to offset. In some areas, nobles and lords even collectively resisted taxes, asking the principality to suspend tax collection on the grounds of lack of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of really poor nobles, the Ministry of Finance is helpless, and can only passively accept the tax arrears of the noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, didn't I ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to bring in other countries to act together! Everyone will share the cost together, and the initial investment should not be too large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a large investment is really needed, or when it is popularized on a large scale, there should not be too much pressure in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Government's financial pressure problem, then continue to discover bonds! Now that the war is over and the principality is in a period of ruins, the newly issued bonds are called construction bonds! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he first took over the throne, he also didn't think about eating and drinking because of the debt problem. I tried everything, but in the end I couldn't solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After an accidental communication with Hudson, George started his bad career. As long as you don't want to solve the problem, then there is no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a change in his thinking and concept, George suddenly found that the troubled debt problem was not so difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to borrow if you have no money, and use the funds raised from the new debt to redeem the interest on the previously issued bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the credit does not collapse, this model of borrowing new and repaying the old can continue forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heavy debt cost expenditures may lead to financial bankruptcy in the future, which is better than financial bankruptcy now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the most difficult moment has been overcome and the principality's economy recovers, things may still turn around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the wedding day approached, Hudson became more and more busy. He got flustered, and at one point he even suspected that monogamy was prevalent in the continent of Aslante because getting married was too troublesome!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that becoming a great nobleman would be able to break the shackles of the rules and gain a higher degree of freedom. I didn't expect that this was just coming out of one besieged city and entering another besieged city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Freedom\", just think about it. If there is a joke at the wedding, the title of nouveau riche may be difficult to remove in this life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't care, no matter how everyone criticizes secretly, no one dares to run in front of him to make a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Koslow family can't afford it. Whatever the strong do is easier to be understood and accepted. But the backlash caused by this will fall on the children of other families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly a matter of mentality. If one's heart is strong enough, one can completely ignore the opinions of the outside world. It's a pity that most people are ordinary people and cannot bear the pressure of public opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How did you get here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Isabel entering the new house, Hudson was speechless. Although the bride has not yet started, it is obviously inappropriate for the lover to come to the wedding room first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid trouble, the lord's mansion that Isabel had already moved out of was arranged in a house in the west of the new town.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But moving away doesn't affect her coming to visit. In fact, most of the time, Isabel still stayed in the Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one takes such small things seriously. No one, including the Holliser family, expressed any objection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a mistress. In their view, if there is no accident, Hudson will have many mistresses in the next few years, but there is always only one wife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how favored a lover is, he can't stand the ravages of time. When the face gets old, everything will return to normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I can't be the hostess here, I'll come and visit the hostess' residence, it's okay!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel's coquettish tone made Hudson lose his temper. It was obvious that she felt threatened and came here to invite pets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, people come and go here, it's not good for people to see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the temptation to deliver it to his door, Hudson, a little overwhelmed, hurriedly spoke to dissuade him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I greeted them, no one dares to spoil the good things of you, the earl, at this time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked seduction, Hudson finally understood Isabel's purpose. Feelings want to come and enter the bridal chamber early, and I have to admit that a woman's jealousy is really terrible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't make trouble, Isabel. If this kind of thing gets out, I'm afraid you will suffer in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't let jealousy blind you. Believe it or not, if you dare to play like this, after Melissa passes through the door, she can arrange a bunch of sisters for you to come in, and maybe even pull you to play with her...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care, it's all about enjoying anyway. It will be miserable for some people, and it may be difficult to even get out of bed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's half-joke made Isabel turn pale with fright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never see newcomers laughing but old ones cry. If the main wife really keeps pushing people around her husband, all the lovers will be exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Vaguely, she felt that she was a little out of control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing cannot be said to others. The outside world doesn't know how many people envy and hate her. If she can't grasp it, there must be a large group of people who are willing to grasp it on her behalf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss, the time is coming, it's time to get ready!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid's reminder pulled Melissa out of worrying about gains and losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Know it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smile on his face revealed the joy in his heart. In any case, from the current point of view, she is undoubtedly successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was also a manifestation of her vision that she was able to pick out a dragon knight from among the many marriage candidates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The earl is a dragon knight, and the dragon will definitely appear later. I have never seen what a dragon looks like. Miss, have you seen what a dragon looks like?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid's chirping words made Melissa roll her eyes. She also wants to know what the dragon looks like!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perseveringly, the two families began to discuss the big marriage as soon as the big battle ended. According to the rules, when the wedding is approaching, they are not allowed to meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic education from a young age does not allow this kind of pre-marital disrespect. Even if Hudson came over, she could only hide in the dark and peek.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the hurry, won't you see it in a while!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the eyes that she has a special feeling for the chatty maid who grew up with her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be an aristocrat, but it is even more difficult to be a noble lady. Behind the rich clothes and fine food, there are cumbersome noble etiquette rules and a family that lacks warmth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Oran loved her very much since he was a child, but that was also based on the premise that her family was valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially with the continuous improvement of Hudson's status, her status in the mansion also increased. Simple family affection is worthless here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of illegitimate children and sisters are examples. They are also young ladies and masters in the mansion. It is difficult to say a word to Earl Oran in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a dragon chant, and everyone knew that today's protagonist had arrived, and the guests went out to watch the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's huge size has attracted a lot of attention. If you look closely, you will find that he has grown a little more than he did a few months ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a big guy is still growing and developing, if it is placed in the Dragon Clan, it will definitely cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is a human race, and most people's understanding of dragons is limited to legends. For Maxim's big man, everyone directly attributed it to strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, according to the rules, Hudson should bring the wedding party here. However, the strong always have privileges, riding Maxim to come is the biggest card, so the wedding process was simply modified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large team of people to welcome the relatives must still be indispensable. It's just that their task has changed, instead of welcoming the bride, it has become the delivery of the dowry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the task of picking up the bride, Maxim is enough! Riding a giant dragon to get married is much more exciting than riding a horse-drawn carriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, this unique wedding can be passed down in the southeastern province and even the entire Alpha Kingdom for countless years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, today's wedding was a show of force, so Hudson naturally let Maxim show off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only restriction is to let him gather his momentum. After all, it's your own wedding, and you can't just throw it up for the sake of pretending. If the dragon's aura is too strong, and you accidentally take away a few guests, it will be embarrassing if the wedding turns into a funeral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no need to order, the people below tacitly gave up a huge open space for Maxim to settle down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who jumped off the dragon, attracted countless eyeballs as soon as he appeared on the stage. Envy, jealousy, and admiration of all kinds of eyes, that's the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having no time to pay attention to everyone's thoughts, Hudson started the process with a smile on his face according to the pre-rehearsed script.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing and tossing for several hours, the exhausted Hudson finally received the bride.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go, Melissa!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson didn't care about the etiquette and rules, and directly picked up the bride and walked out of the new house, and flew tens of meters into the air to land on the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the surprised and envious eyes of the guests below, he directly greeted Maxim to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, can you slow down your dragon flight?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing below, Melissa hugged Hudson tightly and said in a little panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Maxim's flying speed is not fast at the moment, it's just the first time he's set foot at a height of 100 meters, and Melissa isn't used to it yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I released the magic shield, you won't fall!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson deliberately reached out and pinched Melissa's tender little cheek.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marrying a wife is not easy. If it weren't for the privileges of the strong, which simplifies most of the procedures, the wedding alone would take at least a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the wedding lasts for a long time, but that the journey to meet the relatives is too long. There were too many relatives and friends along the way, and the time passed after socializing all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current arrangement is the best for both families. Bringing a giant dragon out to pick up the bride, this thing is the most powerful in the mainland. It not only saves face for both parties, but also saves a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the dowry items, they can be thrown to the wedding reception team and slowly transported back. Anyway, in the name of Hudson, no noble lord dares to block the road and rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hmph! You know how to bully me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Melissa pinched Hudson's waist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who is bullying you, tell me quickly? Be sure to show him how powerful Dragon Knight is!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be confused and teased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flirting between the two did not affect the young single bear, but it affected the adult single dragon below, and there were faint signs of estrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Restricted by traffic, it is not easy for nobles who are scattered all over the world to meet. The marriage of great nobles is not only a celebration, but also an opportunity for everyone to exchange feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is different from the past is that this time the gathering also involved the \"Warcraft Legion Project\" that has caused a lot of trouble in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the great nobles of the kingdom sent important members, but even some big forces abroad also sent important representatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representatives of many forces gathered in the Mountain Territory, making this already legendary wedding even more unusual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson's castle is large enough, otherwise it would be embarrassing if there is no place for the guests to settle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the big figures who were rarely seen in the past, frequently entering the hall, Cheers couldn't help but sigh: \"The Earl of Hudson has a big face, not only the kingdom and all the powers will not fall, but also the northern countries. Almost all of the representatives from here have come!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think back when Hudson was just a fledgling, he was the one who took it with him. In just a few short years of effort, the two sides have widened the qualitative gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of tossing around, he was still a small nobleman, but the ignorant boy in the past stood at the top of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dragon Knight naturally has a lot of face, and now everyone is waiting for the earl's dragon to be in heat and breed! Isn't this wedding the best place for everyone to get closer?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He smiled happily, but deep down he was bleeding. He also made a lot of achievements in this war, not to mention crossing the threshold of the middle-class nobles at one time, at least he should get another fertile fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the family behind him was deeply involved in the case of reselling military supplies, which caused damage to the interests of the kingdom. His background as an aristocrat in the north directly made him miss the post-war rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible to make a fuss. If it weren't for Hudson, the boss, and without family support, they wouldn't even be able to stay in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of blows has long smoothed his arrogance. No matter how talented you are, you can't get ahead if your luck is bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still many children of nobles in the Northland who have encountered similar situations. The original team that the Duke of Kavadia prepared for his son was all cheaper than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they have hard bones, it's just that these unflexible guys have paid the price of their lives in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley is very knowledgeable, and he can see the essence of the problem at a glance. It seems that Earl Hudson has a lot of talents under his command!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden addition of Kayo changed the flavor of this conversation. Regardless of their original background, they all hang out with Hudson now, and the Viscount Cayo in front of him is a core member of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no sign of the two families turning their faces at the moment, everyone present is very good, and they know very well that this kind of harmony is difficult to maintain for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you are planning to change jobs, as a younger brother, if you get too close to the high-level hostile forces, obviously there will be no good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Your Excellency, Viscount, for your compliment. Speaking of the abundance of talents, I still recommend your family in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has only been a few months, and I heard that the nobles have completed the Crimson Knights. This strength background is the most precious wealth we are chasing! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson's words saved everyone from embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he didn't come here to mess things up, and the reality didn't allow him to be self-willed. After some business bragging, Viscount Cayo quickly disappeared into the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a hall dedicated to the activities of the great nobles, it became lively at the moment. As the outside world guessed, coming to attend the wedding was just incidental, and the real purpose was to borrow seeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grand Duke, we came here this time to seek cooperation with sincerity. I have to admit that compared with the big forces in the central and southern parts of the mainland, the development of our northern continent is too lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orc war that just ended, everyone seems to have reached a consensus: the future battlefield belongs to the Extraordinary Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Franks, the Holy See, the Kingdom of Iberia, the Black...all these major forces have formed their own army of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to catch up with them in a short period of time, no matter which one of us can do it alone, the best option is to join forces! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said with a serious expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the \"union\" is in the interests of all countries is still unknown, anyway, it is enough that it is in the interests of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this proposal, the first reaction of the Grand Duke of Newfoundland was: it is not normal, there is a conspiracy, how can there be such an advantage in the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately, he felt relieved again. The current Principality of Moxi does not have the capital to engage in conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, it is a joint investment in research and development, and the final research and development results are shared together. In fact, the same results can play very different roles in the hands of different forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the results are achieved, with the size of the Alpha Kingdom, it will be no problem to form a few full-staffed monster legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how fertile the land of the Principality of Moxi, it can at most maintain half of the military power of the Alpha Kingdom, and the other countries are even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Renato, I personally support your proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all countries in the North Continent. It is undoubtedly the best choice if we can twist together and join hands to catch up with the countries in the South.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is a big matter, I have to report it to His Majesty the King before I can give you an accurate answer! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not in charge of your family, you don't know how expensive firewood is. As the Prime Minister of the Alpha Kingdom, he spends half of his time worrying about financial issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now someone is coming to help share the investment, and he really can't find a reason to refuse. As for the possible exodus of the cultivated monsters, he didn't take it seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exodus of the cultivated monsters is bound to happen. Once the troops are equipped on a large scale, it is impossible to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Frankish Kingdom as an example, the Tyrannosaurus Rex they cultivated painstakingly is sold in some **** markets, but the price is a bit scary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grand Duke, this kind of thing must pay attention to efficiency. It is said that Hudson's red dragon is about to enter the estrus period. If this opportunity is missed, it will be a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best for everyone to reach a cooperation agreement as soon as possible, send all the female beasts to the mountain collar, and wait for the red dragon to come into heat! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said a little impatiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the Alpha Kingdom has already started to act. On the way they arrived at the mountain territory, they encountered a convoy transporting female beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cooperation is not reached as soon as possible, the Alpha Kingdom may complete the first experiment alone. If you have achieved certain results and want to join in later, the price you pay will not be a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when the Grand Duke of Newfoundland had a headache, how should he respond, a dragon chant came from the sky, attracting everyone's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is human nature to like to watch the excitement, and no one needs to organize it. All the guests left the hall as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better achieve the pretentious effect, Hudson deliberately let Maxim circle around in the air a few times, so that the guests could feast their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Habitually reached out and squeezed Melissa's face, Hudson said intimately: \"We're here, let's go down!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

She had so much fun last night that she accidentally made the bride unable to get out of bed now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was also very helpless about this. The physical strength of the magician was really inferior to that of the knight. He didn't try his best, and Melissa couldn't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Take a good rest, I will arrange for someone to deliver the food. There are too many important guests here this time, and I have to go to receive them, so I won't be here with you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said in a soft voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just an ordinary marriage of great nobles, it would be nice to be able to invite one-third of the great nobles present. After all, the Koslow family has no friendship with everyone, and an upstart is not worthy of people's support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the reason was, Hudson had to be careful with the gathering of representatives of the major forces in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the next thing is handled well, then his network of contacts will extend to the entire Northern Continent; if he messes it up, it may be a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not uncommon in aristocratic circles to destroy if you can't get it. From the very beginning, Hudson never thought of trying to protect himself and occupy the Yalong Warcraft Legion alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats are not stupid, how could they watch the mountain leader family dominate. Once he finds out that his arrangement may be threatened, what greets him is a thunderbolt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is for everyone to do it together. When everyone has a Warcraft Legion, the Warcraft Legion in the Mountain Territory will be inconspicuous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the other three dragon knights in the mainland, we know that none of them monopolize the descendants of the dragon. Of course, there have been exceptions in history. For example, if the mount is a female dragon, no one will make any decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone has high integrity, but the main reason is that the dragon's ability to reproduce is really pitifully low. It is impossible for ordinary monsters to impregnate dragons, let alone human beings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In history, someone offended a female tyrannosaur because of this, and then attracted a group of suitors of the female dragon to besiege, and the end was miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get busy first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A good aristocratic education prevented her from being willful. From the beginning of her memory, the words \"the overall situation is the most important\" have been imprinted in her bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sensible wife can always cause pain. Nodding in response, Hudson stepped out of the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Dragon Breeding Project\" involves too much. You can see how many forces are interested in it by looking at the number of nobles who participated in the wedding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Domestic, foreign, and the network of relationships involved behind it, Hudson can't figure it out at all now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing deeply, he knew that the next thing could only be left to the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the opportunity to make a fortune, just think about it in your heart. If you really do it, there is a high probability that you will be choked to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a nobleman contacts him in private, he can use whatever he wants, and no one can say what you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem now is that everyone should form a group together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no formal contact has been made yet, from the information he has collected, he already knows that all major forces in the Northern Continent have proposed to the kingdom to join this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking up at the sky, Hudson suddenly realized. Since you can't get rid of it, then simply sell a wave of favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money can be done at any time; but if you want to build a network of contacts, it is not that simple!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the more forces involved and the more resources invested, the greater the probability of achieving results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson sensed a business opportunity. A large number of monsters gather in the mountain territory, and they have to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys are not something that can be done with a few pieces of black bread. Most of Warcraft are carnivores, or omnivores, only a very small number of vegetarians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some of these female beasts are vegetarians, their offspring will switch to eating meat. Hudson has no doubts about the genetic influence of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of big stomach kings gathers, killing thousands of cattle and sheep every day is a breeze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the breeding business in the mountainous area will get a great opportunity to flourish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft must be consumed, and those involved in R&amp;D management must also consume it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among these people, there are many well-known \"big men\", plus guards and servants, there must be at least tens of thousands of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this model is followed, the Mountain Territory will immediately become the largest breeding base of monsters in the northern continent, and may even have the opportunity to develop into the largest breeding base of monsters in the entire continent in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft is jointly owned by the major forces, but Hudson himself is the beneficiary of the prosperity of business and trade brought about by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the influx of a large number of talents, which also created opportunities for him to poach corners. There is a high probability that famous and important people cannot be dug out, but their apprentices and juniors may be dug out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the infrastructure is done well, there may be a bunch of supporting industries and economies: for example: magic potion, various alchemy...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, the more forces involved and the greater everyone's investment, the faster the development of the mountainous territory will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, in the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Earl Hudson's wedding has gathered all major forces in the North Continent. According to the information we have collected, this gathering was led by the Mosi people, intending to unite all parties to create a monster army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current state of the Alpha Kingdom is not good, not to mention the lack of financial resources, and the time to intervene is too late. Relying on their own strength alone, if they want to create an army of monsters, they may not be able to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the style of Caesar III, there is a high probability that he will choose to join forces with major forces at this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs **** said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war against the orcs ended and the three major powers on the northern continent fell into decline, they were no longer the focus of the Frankish kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now that all parties unite, the situation becomes different. Even though the overall national strength of many small countries is not very good, it does not mean that they have no talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, a few master alchemists, magic pharmacists, arcanists... that is also very possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people are scattered among the major forces and are inconspicuous. Once they are gathered, the power that can explode becomes extraordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this opportunity is used to allow the major forces in the Northern Continent to form a military alliance, the situation in the entire Aslant Continent will change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Charles III faintly regretted that he shouldn't have smashed the Orc Empire with a single stick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this feeling of regret did not last long. It is easy to talk about union, but if you really want to implement it, it will become very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the threat of orcs, the major forces have not been able to unite, let alone think about it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need to worry too much. Although Caesar III's methods are powerful, the major forces in the Northern Continent are not easy to use. With the current state of the Alpha Kingdom, there is no way to integrate the strength of all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it is in the interests of all parties, they can join forces for a short time. Once this bond of interest is lost, the alliance will immediately exist in name only.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft Legion cannot be created in a day or two. We have spent decades of hard work to achieve the current results. It was only at this time that he started to intervene, and he was already behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, our real opponent is the Holy See, followed by continental powers like Iberia. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his opinion, when the orc threat was the worst, Caesar III failed to integrate the countries of the Northern Continent, and now he has no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Northern Continent, a plate of scattered sand, did not pose any threat to the Frankish Kingdom. Just pay a little attention, there is no need to waste too much energy on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Alpha Kingdom's internal organizational capabilities far surpass those of the countries on the mainland, and we still cannot take them lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, it is best to find something for them to do and delay their plans as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the current international situation, we can hand over this villain to the Holy See. I think Pius VII won't mind, and will be a knife for us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Bergson reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is a competitor, it must be suppressed. Occasionally teaming up is only for the needs of interests. When interests conflict, there must be black hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The chancellor means to get rid of their debts?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation on the mainland is generally stable, and most of the major forces of the human race are busy immigrating to develop the prairie, and it is not easy to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost impossible to destroy the alliance of the northern countries just to sow discord. Even if there are a few naive people who are fooled, the lack of a few participants will continue to affect the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best option is to attack the Alpha Kingdom directly, making them overwhelmed and delaying the plan to build the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the debt problem is indeed a problem for the Alpha Kingdom, but it is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they take action on this issue, it is estimated that they can also survive the crisis. In the end, the unlucky one is likely to be the Principality of Moxi, which is in a more serious crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, Caesar III's body had problems a few years ago, and he was assassinated once last year. It is estimated that he is already struggling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal circumstances, he would live for at most two or three years before going to see the Lord of Dawn. If something happened to make him angry, the time would be even shorter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the heir has a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See is very good at this, as long as we push it secretly, they should get things done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the death of Caesar III coincides with the outbreak of the debt crisis, it is estimated that no one will care about the Warcraft Legion plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Bergson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he didn't plan to cheat the Alpha Kingdom, but the major forces in the Northern Continent quickly moved closer, which made him see the potential threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the major forces in the Northern Continent led by the Alpha Kingdom form an alliance, another top force that can compete with Frank will be added to the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the prime minister of the Frankish Kingdom, for the benefit of the country, he had to deal ruthlessly with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regicide has no guts, but if you **** off Caesar III, then there is no pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially if you don't have to do it yourself, just borrow a knife to kill people, and you can complete the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Charles III nodded. The means are indeed a little despicable, but as long as others don't know that they did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can even wait for the incident to happen, and then reach out to the Alpha Kingdom and sell a big favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The addition of Hudson added a pot of boiling oil to the already heated discussion, directly bringing the atmosphere to a climax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When specific interests are involved, quarrels are always inevitable. As the core of this plan, Hudson, who was supposed to occupy a dominant position, decisively chose to be the melon eater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the show is, when you get bored after watching it too much, after more than ten days in a row, Hudson, who couldn't help it, finally broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, according to my observations, Mr. Maxim has already shown signs of heat. Maybe sending a group of female beasts over now may mate immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you continue to delay like this, you may miss this opportunity, everyone should come up with the results as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if it doesn't break out, a large group of people gather here, entertaining them with good wine and meat every day, and the cost alone is not a small expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that everyone gave generous gifts, Hudson suspected that he would not be able to help lowering the reception standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Hudson's choice of entry point is very effective. Hearing that the giant dragon was about to go into heat, the expressions of the people who had been arguing all of a sudden became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the representatives of some distant forces, their faces are even more beautiful. Although they are all preparing the female beast early, who can guarantee that they will be able to catch up with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Missed the estrus period, and then sent the female beast to the dragon, it was giving someone extra food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the dragon's performance can be described as extreme - scum. One moment she was still Xiao Tiantian, but the next moment she turned her back on the beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, is the news confirmed? Mr. Maxim, is it really about to go into heat?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland asked nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of geographical factors, the Alpha Kingdom has made the fastest preparations. So far, some female beasts have been sent over, but it is still not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the major forces in the kingdom are sending people deep into the area where the beasts are active, constantly looking for female beasts suitable for mating. The commission for finding female beasts in the mercenary guild is also constantly setting new records.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grand Duke, you know that I am a magician. There is still little research on the signs of a dragon's estrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to my observation, Mr. Maxim is entering the estrus period. If you want to come over to borrow seeds, then act quickly. As for the disputes on the details, you can go back and discuss them slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this cooperation is long-term, and it does not end with one loan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a lie. Ever since he got married, Maxim's state has been a little bit wrong, and he has been nagging in his ears all day to find the female dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this reason, Bear Stearns often ridiculed him. However, no matter how much he ridiculed, he couldn't change his Sichun's heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also happy to see this change. This is the red dragon that entered the state by himself, he didn't take any medicine, and even if something happened later, he didn't feel guilty at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The game of interests doesn't matter, as long as it doesn't happen in the mountainous territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being sandwiched between various forces seems to be able to reap benefits, but it is also accompanied by endless dangers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that only by personally negotiating can he maximize his benefits, Hudson still chose to stay behind the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a preliminary cooperation draft has been reached, which obviously cannot quell the dispute, and the parties will inevitably engage in a game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But all of this has nothing to do with Hudson, no matter what happens next, the Warcraft breeding base must be placed in the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nelson, how is the communication with all parties?

Who would refuse such a good thing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But some people have heard some rumors about the plan of the Warcraft Legion and want to get some Yalong beasts from you. I don't know what your charter is, so I dare not directly agree. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson said with some concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really embarrassing for the boss to hang out with the younger brother, but the family's interests outweigh the face. His birth determined that he would not be able to go out and join other powerful forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a core member of the family, it is natural to be comfortable in the family, but it does not mean that his authority is so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before proving his ability, only Hudson can decide on important matters involving family interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is normal to receive news. This plan is not a secret in the kingdom. Anyone who wants to inquire can know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, most of the counties are small nobles. With their financial resources, they can only raise a few monsters at most. They can wait for the monsters to become popular in the kingdom before seeking them out. There is no need to reach out at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who made these demands either had hidden backgrounds behind them, or were really stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, tell them they want Warcraft, but it will take a few years and it will cost a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much they need to pay depends on what monsters they want and when they need them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether these nobles have hidden backgrounds, or are really stupid, Hudson doesn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of territorial replacement, we are not afraid of their demands, but we are afraid that they will have no desires.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many requirements, easy to solve. To put it bluntly like this, there is no problem at all if you want to get Warcraft as compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft is exiled, so it is better to exile. Since all forces in the Northern Continent have joined the plan, there is no possibility of any secrecy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the benefits paid are large enough, Hudson can arrange it clearly even if he arranges the female animal to come over to borrow seeds in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you get too much compensation, the territory you get in exchange cannot be so perfect. Trading is all about reciprocity, and now they can get a premium, but this premium will definitely not be too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the kind of aristocrats who want nothing, want nothing, and are determined to be nail households. Hudson has nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a rising nobleman, he must pay attention to eating. Such immoral things as forcing small nobles to move must not be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since there is no problem here, I will give them an answer as soon as possible. However, there are too many nobles involved. Even if an agreement can be reached immediately, the replacement of the territory will take a year or two to complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main problem is the relocation of the territory personnel. In the case of avoiding a large number of casualties, the most optimistic estimate is that the relocation work will take more than a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relocation expenses that need to be invested are at least hundreds of thousands of gold coins; if the compensation for the lords is added, the cost may cost more than one million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current income situation of the territory, the fiscal revenue in the next two to three years may have to be included. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson said with quite a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the Koslow family has already entered the threshold of great aristocracy, but in fact it is far behind in many aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the financial revenue, we can see that all key projects in the territory are currently in the initial stage of investment, and it is difficult to see results in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't made a fortune during the war, the mountain territory's own hematopoietic ability would not have been able to support the various projects in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War wealth is a one-time income after all, and the territory has been in a state of making ends meet for a long time, which still makes the Koslow family worried. I'm afraid that Hudson's old capital will be eaten up, and the territory's own hematopoietic ability has not kept up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These are necessary expenses, no matter how difficult the finances are, they can't be saved in this area. The large migration of hundreds of thousands of people, costing millions of gold coins is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to save money, then release news and brag about the power of the Warcraft Legion as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In the future, the standard of knights in the kingdom will change. In addition to their own strength requirements, they must also have a monster mount!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the momentum is built, wealthy nobles can't help but plan for a rainy day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The descendants of the giant dragon, even if the mother beast is a first-order monster, can grow to the third-order. A Warcraft is equivalent to a loyal senior knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky and have a blood mutation, you may be able to cultivate mid-level and high-level monsters. That's a beast passed down for ten generations, and the beast is still there when the people are gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most aristocrats, it is still too dangerous to go to capture wild monsters, and buying artificially bred monsters is the best choice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words shocked Nelson. Once the knight's standard is raised, it is equivalent to a subversion of the existing order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't scare me! If all knights are equipped with Warcraft mounts as standard, what will happen to the small nobles in the kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for a family with a prosperous population, as many knights as you have, you have to configure as many mounts, which may drive everyone crazy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson shook his head immediately, and said angrily: \"Nelson, why are you panicking?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky is falling, and it is not your turn to top it. Even if the knight threshold is further raised, it will not affect our interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the king is not a fool, how could he not take countermeasures?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are completely left alone, I am afraid that within twenty years, one-third of the minor nobles in the kingdom will be shuffled out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the time is extended to fifty years, I am afraid that more than half of the noble families will disappear in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disappearance of a large number of small nobles will inevitably push up the wave of territorial mergers in the kingdom, and finally form an oligopoly model of big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can all see the problem clearly, can His Majesty think otherwise?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To avoid the worst situation, there are still many measures that can be taken, for example: the kingdom provides knights with monster mounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: wantonly recruiting small nobles to join the kingdom's standing army, using monster mounts as daily equipment to directly equip the entire army, and then setting a service period that can be owned for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, there are many measures that can be taken. Now we just need to take advantage of everyone's panic and make a small profit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"But Hudson, we don't have a monster in our hands! The entire Koslow family, you own a dragon and a bear, and the others have never even touched the shadow of a monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there will be many female beasts coming to breed in the future, most of the cubs are from major forces, and the number we can keep will not be too many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make too many promises and fail to fulfill them, it may affect your reputation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson reminded seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how important it is to make money, it is not as important as Hudson's personal reputation. As the only figure in the Koslow family who can show their hands, Hudson's reputation must never collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I'm not going to promise a specific time. Essentially, what I'm selling now is the expectation. If I can't pay in three years, I will take five years. If I can't pay in five years, I will take ten, twenty, or thirty years...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the time period is stretched long enough, these are not problems. Explain the problem clearly in advance, and I think everyone will understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For everyone's peace of mind, before delivery, we can provide refund service at any time without any fees. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they are selling Warcraft, but they are actually selling futures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment of artificial breeding, it is doomed that the value of the current Warcraft and the future Warcraft will not be at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only uncertain factor is that the market is monopolized by the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a vested interest group, setting thresholds for latecomers is an instinctive sense of self-protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain a monopoly advantage, it is normal for strategic resources such as Warcraft mounts to be set at a sky-high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, it's okay to extend the time period, but it's not necessary to refund at any time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an accident in the middle, all the risks fall on us, and the loss will be huge. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Nelson with a question mark on his face, Hudson knows this high-end gameplay, which once again refreshed his cognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The risk is too great, Nelson, you are still too young!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember one sentence: the risk always belongs to the rule-governer, not the rule-maker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be prerequisites for refunding at any time. You can't just refund the money immediately after paying, isn't that just kidding us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can set a refund time limit, for example: apply one month in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or set a one-year or two-year closure period, during which refunds are prohibited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the prerequisites are met, and they want a refund, just send it to them. Even with all refunds together, their money was on loan to us for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You only need to compare the bond interest issued by the Kingdom to know how much profit there is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether these Warcraft orders can be successfully concluded in the future, we have received a lot of development funds. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It could have gone further, but Hudson didn't want to take things too far because of his reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly the current nobles who have suffered too little beatings from society, and their psychological endurance has not yet been tempered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the price of Warcraft is fully futuresized and the market is allowed to control the rise and fall, everyone's mentality will collapse soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't want to be scolded as immoral every day, so he simply followed the rules of the times and locked in the Warcraft transaction price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, no matter whether the transaction is successful or not, everyone's gold coins have not lost any.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the price of Warcraft rises sharply next time, everyone will earn money; if the price drops sharply, you can refund and buy it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having never seen how capital is played, most aristocrats probably don't know how much profit they have lost by entering and exiting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the wedding room, Hudson felt amused when he saw Melissa constantly tapping on the abacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ever since I saw his abacus in the Mountain Territory, this thing has become Melissa's new toy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the moment, I am busy tapping the beads, checking the dowry on the accounts, and various gifts received at this wedding banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mistress, these are essential tasks. Especially the gift list, every item recorded on it will have to be returned in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's almost enough, you have checked the data on these accounts four times!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He tried hard to persuade, but what he received was a blank stare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although she had touched accounts at home before, it was just contact, and it was not Melissa's turn to make decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that she has become the hostess of the mansion, it is the time when the freshness is at its peak. Melissa doesn't want to make any jokes because of her negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm busy, let your lover accompany you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said he refused, but his body honestly allowed Hudson to walk up and down with his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is jealousy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expected Shura field did not happen as expected. Perhaps because she has seen more, Melissa is more open-minded than Hudson when it comes to raising a lover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this has something to do with physical strength. Facing the energetic Hudson, the female magician really couldn't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once I couldn't hold on anymore, and asked the maid to join the battle. However, that was not Hudson's favorite type, so he rejected it decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harmonious married life made the relationship between the two heat up rapidly. The more magnanimous Melissa was, the more ashamed Hudson would be on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he is thick-skinned enough to never dwell on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who has time to eat your jealousy, I am busy! You are making trouble here, if you make a mistake and offend someone, it is your responsibility.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be heard from Jiao Didi's tone that Melissa is not really angry, but more like encouraging Hudson to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, that's all my responsibility! Come, let me see the accounts made by Madam herself.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Said to be looking at the account book, but in fact Hudson only glanced at the total, and said with a smile: \"I can't tell, my wife is still a little rich woman, my father-in-law is really generous this time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dowry is indeed ridiculously rich, far exceeding the normal level. Compared with a normal marriage, the gold coins and goods for this dowry are actually not many, and more are property shares.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very realistic. The Holliser family is not rich now. Shifting the strategic center of gravity to the north requires too much wealth to be consumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the base camp is relocated, it will inevitably lead to many clan industries, which cannot be taken care of. All tearfully sold, but also a little unwilling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, in the name of dowry, it is the best choice to stuff some shares in these industries and use Hudson's prestige to deter prying eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, aren't you angry at all?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked without confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a married person, she is still helping her mother's family to take care of the property, which is obviously not in line with contemporary mainstream values.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Melissa has no choice. The family has cultivated her for so many years, and they have to pay back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these properties are not brought over in the name of dowry, if they want to name the Koslow family in the future and deter the nobles in the province, they will have to pay more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why are you angry? Could it be that the Holliser family doesn't pay you dividends every year?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His logical concept is very simple, sharing the benefits is equivalent to giving protection fees, and it is also appropriate to use his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's purely white whoring, then you have to reconsider the way the two get along. Nobility, that's how realistic it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Naturally, we have to divide, or I will come here empty-handed, and where will I put the face of the two families when I pass it on?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing that Hudson was really not angry, Melissa simply let go of her concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's it. According to the above information, the dividends that can be obtained every year are at least tens of thousands of gold coins. I have nothing to worry about!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you should tell me about this kind of thing! You didn't even know that you would give me a word, so you agreed on your own initiative, but you will be punished! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pinched Melissa's face and said jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The king has many ways to live, and Caesar III chose the most tiring one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he was in power, he has made every effort to turn the tide, and now he has solved the threat of orcs and fulfilled the long-cherished wish of his ancestors for hundreds of years. However, new challenges come again, as if things are never finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have been moving forward under pressure and heavy burdens, in exchange for the revival of the royal family and the stability of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Caesar, in view of the current international situation, the Kingdom needs to deepen its ally relationship with the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when you are old enough to get married, I want you to marry Princess Anne of the Principality of Moxi. You've seen it yourself, how do you feel? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Questioning, obviously redundant. From the smile on his face, you can see what Crown Prince Caesar thinks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was in the Principality of Moxi, he was obsessed with Princess Anne. If it weren't for the big defeat on the battlefield, he would have proposed marriage a long time ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the defeat on the battlefield made him lose the right to speak. Including the right to choose personal marriage, they were all buried in a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I put it all down at first, but I didn't expect that there would be a day when things would turn around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem! As the prince of the kingdom, I am obliged to contribute to the cause of the kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political marriage, being able to marry someone you like, is a stroke of luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the changes in the international situation, the two \"bad brothers\" of the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi needed to stay together for warmth, and this marriage would have been impossible to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be too happy too early, things haven't been settled yet, maybe there may be twists and turns in the middle.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with quite a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the last major defeat, Crown Prince Caesar lost not only the tens of thousands of troops of the Alpha Kingdom, but also hundreds of thousands of Mosi troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, Crown Prince Caesar's reputation in the Principality of Moxi is negative. It's not the Moxi royal family at all, the ideal marriage partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Caesar III also considered choosing a marriage partner from among the great nobles in the country to help his son stabilize his position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, such a thing as marriage, not only depends on the right family, but also depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happened that none of the big families in the kingdom that he had his eye on had girls of the right age. Either already married, or too young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The closest one is only seven years old now, and what's even worse is that he is already engaged. Even if Crown Prince Caesar wanted to wait, there was no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relax the conditions to all great nobles, and the most suitable one is the late Duke of Pias, who has a fourteen-year-old prostitute who is not engaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that such a marriage is impossible to pass. It was hard to suppress the arrogance of the northern nobles, how could Caesar III release them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing that there were twists and turns, Crown Prince Caesar's face instantly collapsed. It is self-evident what the twists and turns are, they are all created by themselves, and it is impossible to blame them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the episode, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly became tense. The Prime Minister at the side, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, took advantage of the opportunity to change the subject: \"Your Majesty, the Warcraft Legion plan has officially started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, more than two-thirds of the countries in the Northern Continent have joined this plan. There is a high probability that the remaining countries will also choose to join.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After repeated discussions, there are currently two options to choose from:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, all parties will jointly provide human, financial and material resources to promote the implementation of the plan. After the monsters are cultivated to almost adulthood, they will be distributed according to their respective contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second, the initial investment is shared by everyone. After the cubs are born, everyone will directly distribute the cubs according to the previous investment ratio. Subsequent cultivating monsters will be carried out independently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps out of some kind of worry, most countries tend to the second way, preferring to raise the cubs themselves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that everyone's worries are themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Alpha Kingdom was the most powerful kingdom in the Northern Continent. The Warcraft breeding base is located here. In case of conflicts in the future, it is entirely possible to detain everyone's Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Signing a contract is useless, no matter how strong the constraints are, they are time-sensitive. No matter how many promises are made, once they are no longer in place, they may be overturned by latecomers at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to solve the trust problem. It is obviously impossible to have close cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, they want to take the cubs directly, and we can't stop them, so let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, drug research and development still requires everyone to cooperate. Otherwise, only the power of the kingdom wants to catch up with the top level of the mainland, and it is not known when it will have to wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northland countries have similar problems, and this is the basis of our cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people to communicate with representatives of all parties, and the Warcraft cubs can be directly distributed after birth, but some of them must be left for experiments. All countries will send people together to jointly research and develop medicines to promote the growth of Warcraft. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said after sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Working together is the best choice, but trust issues cannot be resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be shadows of other forces behind this, otherwise even if it is a riot, it will not be so fast. At the very least, these problems will not erupt until a large number of Warcraft cubs are born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't reach the ideal state, then you should settle for the next best thing, and first get out the medicine that promotes the growth and development of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it is based on the original medicine and made certain improvements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pharmaceuticals that promote the growth of monsters are actually in the hands of almost all major forces in the mainland. It's just that these medicines either have too many side effects; or the cost is too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I'm afraid things are not that simple. Everyone's environment is different, and the female beasts chosen may not be the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the research of various countries in the south, although the potions that promote the growth of monsters are effective for most monsters, their effects on different monsters are not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a joint research and development, I am afraid that everyone will be more inclined to configure exclusive potions for their own sub-dragon monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can really cooperate will choose the forces with the same race as the female beast. And this kind of cooperation also has great reservations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing everyone together for joint research and development may be more meaningful than being able to communicate in a timely manner, rather than research and development. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan was proposed by the Ministry of Military Affairs, but as the progress progressed, he was embarrassed to find that there were more and more troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't want to hear these meaningless complaints. You all know how the kingdom's finances are doing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we must rely on a limited budget to complete the Warcraft Legion plan. If the cost can be reduced, then the cost should be reduced as much as possible, so the combination is imperative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Problems that may arise during the joint process, then find a way to coordinate and solve them. We are worrying, and those small countries will only worry more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Little Caesar, you also follow to help. The plan: only success, no failure! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, there was a coughing sound. It can be seen from the bloodstains leaking from the handkerchief that Caesar III's body is already very bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince should have been under the guardianship of the prince, and he would be able to recuperate with peace of mind, but he was worried about Little Caesar!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, such an important project that is easy to produce results should be presided over by the crown prince to make political achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he had no idea in his heart, so Caesar III finally decided to let his son follow him to learn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain collar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the end of the lord's wedding, the Territory's \"Three-Year Development Plan\" was also put on the agenda, and various projects were carried out in an orderly manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What caused the most heated discussions was the measures to reward fertility. It involves the vital interests of everyone, and the number of times it is discussed is naturally the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strict orders were issued one after another, and the chiefs of Baojia who were responsible for the specific implementation were really frowning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Kane, we have to pay attention to production and birth, we are really too busy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sowa said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the guardians of the territory, Sova is also a special existence. In the past three years, the Bao led by him has won the first place in land reclamation for three consecutive years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It stands to reason that in the mountainous area where there is a serious shortage of excellent managers, such an outstanding security chief should have been promoted long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Naisuowa is an illiterate one, and he can manage a guarantee, but if he goes up, he will be caught blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to send it to the literacy class for training. It seems to be insulated from cultural knowledge. After a month of tossing, I have learned my own name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was promoted twice, but after working for less than ten days, I resigned on my own initiative and came back, and continued to be the head of the small security.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not only one similar grassroots official. They lack education, and their personal ceiling is so low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the top students who are commended every year are still very popular with the leaders in charge of land reclamation projects. If there are more grassroots officials who are down-to-earth and hard-working, the results at the end of the year will be better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boss Sowa, if you are too busy, you have to implement it! The lord personally issued a strict order to increase the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, we have opened up a lot of land, and we will continue to open up wasteland in the future. With so many good lands, we can't just leave them so barren, can we?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the problem of encouraging birth and affecting production, it is actually still controllable. Even if you are pregnant, it will not affect the work of the young and strong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, women get pregnant one after another. Except during maternity leave, pregnant women can't do heavy work at other times, but they can also do some simple things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, all Baojia must implement the policy of encouraging births, and you are not the only ones affected, and it will not affect the final evaluation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane explained patiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order of the lord, here it is the imperial decree. In the minds of low-level officials, Hudson's status is still unparalleled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone came here halfway to follow him. Compared with the hungry days in the past, although there is a lot of work for the mountain leaders, they can eat enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after becoming an official, even for the lowest level of existence, life has changed drastically from before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's fine, since the lord personally issued the order, then I will implement it according to the regulations!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sowa replied bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the worry in my heart, which still lingers. The reward for encouraging birth this time is meat, and he is very clear about the temptation of this thing to the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, you can't eat meat twice a month, but now you can get it after giving birth. And the more you live, the more you will be rewarded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention other people, even he, the security chief, was a little tempted, considering whether to have two more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, his family only gave birth to seven cubs, and only four survived, which was far from the lord's goal of having ten excellent babies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once everyone works hard to create humans, the progress of land reclamation will inevitably be affected. Unable to think of a solution, Suowa simply became troubled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the order was issued by the lord, so just follow the regulations. Slightly affecting the progress of land reclamation, it is estimated that the problem will not be too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reassuring the outstanding staff, Kane took a look at everyone, and continued to ask: \"Does anyone else have any questions?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not for show, but to really solve the problem. Faced with the target of 60,000 new infants and young children within three years proposed by the lord, if you don't work hard, you won't be able to achieve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more troublesome is not only to be born, but also to increase the baby's survival rate. Strive to control the infant mortality rate within 25% after three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this data only counts healthy babies. If there is a congenital problem, there is no way, the existing medical technology - no solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, not only is the infant mortality rate high, but the child mortality rate is also not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of a baby growing up from birth to adulthood will not exceed half. Any disease or accident may take a life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a noble family, the probability is not too high. Many families have extinct heirs, not because they did not have children, but because the children born did not grow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the low survival rate that it is necessary to have more births. Only if there are enough births, can the existence of an heir be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Kane, you just said that after the child is born, he will be blessed by the priest. Is this true?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the old man's question, Kane almost choked. Is this what should be the focus?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Infants are born and receive the baptism blessing of the priest, which is the tradition of the continent of Aslante. However, with the decline of the Holy See, this tradition has been abandoned for many years in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, but the tedious baptismal blessing process may lead to the death of the baby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the cold winter months, if you accept baptism naked, the probability of accidents is higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the Holy See, this is possessed by a demon, belonging to an unknown person, and cannot bear the blessing of the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of nonsense is just to fool the people at the bottom. The great nobles who knew the nature of the Holy See didn't take it seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for some families with difficult heirs, it is not easy for them to obtain a descendant. If they go to participate in the risky baptism, wouldn't they be mentally ill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old tradition was quickly broken. In an anti-Holy See country like the Alpha Kingdom, the baptism ceremony was even explicitly revised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asking the pastor to come over for a cutscene, even if the ceremony is completed, this is already the practice of devout believers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course it is true. After the child is seven years old, the territory will organize priests to conduct collective blessings.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane immediately made a remedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Babies have a high mortality rate in the first place, so if you go to toss the newborn baby, you guessed that the lord will treat him with a whip later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the age of seven, cubs with poor physical fitness will be eliminated by the laws of nature. At that time, there will be a symbolic ceremony, then it will not be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's it, I will definitely let my son have more children in the future! The great Lord of Dawn, this time I will finally take care of my family...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said with a red face, the mental state of the whole person has improved a lot, and the piety between his brows made Kane frown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the scene, he was helpless to find that many grassroots officials were showing expressions of excitement at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 336": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 336: Spy to work hard\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 336 The spy who wants to work hard\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the implementation of the three-year plan, all kinds of messy problems have gradually been collected in Hudson's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most eye-catching thing is the religious issue. The influence of the Holy See on the upper echelons of the kingdom has been eliminated in the game between kingship and theocracy, but its influence on the lower echelons has not diminished at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the population of the territory was small, this kind of problem was not obvious. After all, fanatics are a very small minority after all, and they can't make any waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, the situation has changed. With the rapid growth of the territory's population, the number of fanatics also increased, and even entered the grassroots management team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is in no rush to act. Religious issues are never resolved overnight. The people at the bottom struggling on the death line cannot live without faith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the practice of other nobles, they all turned the people of the local church into their own people, so as to complete the overall control of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, Hudson also played like this. It's just that there are too few priests in the Mountain Territory, and they don't have the time to go deep into the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps the doctrine should be revised!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Muttering something, when it was time to take practical action, Hudson stopped again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is not qualified to be initiated by a lord. Looking at the entire continent, the only ones who have the courage and ability to initiate further religious reforms are the anti-Holy See Charles III and Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating again and again, Hudson decided not to act in a hurry. The current situation in the kingdom is not optimistic. Caesar III's physical condition is worrying, and it is obviously not suitable for making big moves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III is in the prime of his life, but he is too far away from Hudson, and he cannot exert influence even if he wants to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with his actions, Hudson feels that he will do nothing, and Charles III will also launch a new round of religious reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race only needs one overlord. The Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See have long since turned their faces. If the foundation of the Holy See's rule is not overthrown, the Frankish Kingdom's position within the human race will not be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, the establishment of the Arcane Academy was the first shot in Charles III's anti-Holy See movement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Religious reformation has always started with emancipating the mind. If there is no god, with the current negative image of the Holy See, countries already have the basis to initiate a comprehensive religious reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the existence of the Lord of Dawn, everyone is inevitably a little timid in their actions. The actions taken must also be persisted: against the Holy See, not against the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confine the struggle to within the framework of intra-believers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current actions of the major forces against the Holy See are all trying to divide the church, but they have not directly attacked the doctrine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson began to write quickly. An anti-Holy See base camp like the Arcane Academy must be established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory does not have the ability to establish an arcane academy, but the Alpha Kingdom does. If you don't take advantage of Caesar III's reign to implement things, there is a high probability that the successors will not have such courage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Arcane Academy takes root in the Alpha Kingdom, someone will tamper with the teachings, and there is no need for Hudson to be the first bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stated various pros and cons, and saw that no omissions were found, and was about to seal it, Hudson suddenly changed his face, cursed himself for being stupid, and immediately released a fireball to burn the secret letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, Caesar III is not a fool. I actually wanted to use him as a spearman, did I really think the king was easy to bully?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson dared to bet that if his letter was sent to Caesar III and the future Arcane Academy was established, he would be one of the founders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to refuse, but I can't find a suitable reason. Only you can fill the hole you dug yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Successfully avoided a crisis, but deep down, Hudson was still a little nervous. At this moment, he suddenly understood why the nobles didn't like the hero anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king is too shrewd. Although he handles internal and external affairs in an orderly manner, it is not easy to fool around!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little careless, instead of fooling the king, he dug a hole and buried himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that all the great nobles in the kingdom have suffered a lot in the past years. The more times you are cheated, the more you learn to behave and become more peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking through all this, Hudson immediately decided to change his thinking. It was enough to secretly send people to publicize the benefits of establishing the Arcane Academy, and it was unnecessary to personally push it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows whether it will be successful, and now it depends on who will be the first to fall into the trap and jump out to promote the establishment of the Arcane Academy to draw hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by geopolitics. If he is an inland lord, he will do this kind of thing. Hudson will never be cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he is a coastal lord. If he spreads too much hatred, he will face **** revenge from the Holy See when he sets foot in the ocean in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to notify Kane, Jacob, Rudolph... to come to discuss matters at night.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Tom outside the door had already turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only change is that on the parchment on Hudson's desk, there are two more characters - quit impetuosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of successes, although Hudson didn't say anything, but deep down, he was still a little proud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are proud, you will get carried away. Unknowingly, Hudson found that he had become \"impetuous\", and almost did the stupid thing of using the king as a gunman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he reacted in time, otherwise, if he continued to do this, he would kill himself sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a rising nobleman, there were already many people staring at him. Although he seems to have a good relationship with everyone now, once a fatal flaw is exposed, he will be eaten immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him too young?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It came out so fast, if the forces of all parties are not afraid, then there will be problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action was taken. It was because Hudson sold a lot of favors during the war. No one wanted to bear the reputation of being ungrateful. Everyone was embarrassed to do it in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there is no conflict of interest with most of the nobles, so they don't have to act as a leader and make wedding dresses for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several companies with conflicting interests happened to be seriously injured in the war, so they didn't have time to seek his bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally ushered in a period of peaceful development. If you don't settle down to develop your territory and pragmatic foundation, instead you run to stir up the situation and send yourself into the vortex of the storm. Wouldn't it be self-destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is reflecting, but the Mountain Territory is very lively. Since his big marriage, it seems that the valve has been opened, and the Koslow family has married with nobles from all over the country one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are only collateral descendants, and some of their ancestors have never held a title for three or five generations, this does not affect their marriage with minor nobles outside under the banner of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are also thresholds for participating in a marriage. At the very least, one must first become a knight and show certain potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is nothing, there are so many members of the Koslow family, Baron Redman has no time to organize for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't work if you want to, because that is not a marriage, but an enmity with someone. Unless it is a continuation, the object of the noble marriage must also be the noble. This is the most basic principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a child of a big family, as long as you become a knight, you can get a knight title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earls like Hudson have the right to enshrine the lower-level nobles. It's just that this kind of nobleman is the vassal of the great nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, Hudson will not be stingy with an empty title when treating his own man, but there is no need to think about the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless he has made great achievements, he will not divide his territory and make it a fief for his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only Hudson, but all the great nobles in the whole continent did this. The guys who wantonly split the territory are all in the competition of the aristocratic world and have been eliminated by history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every day, Baron Redman arranges marriages for the children of the family, and Baron Redman is about to become an exclusive matchmaker. Busy is busy, but seeing the prosperity of the family, he is still in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This good mood didn't last long, and slowly disappeared. Under the background of a well-matched family, all the children of the family have found suitable marriage partners, but no one cares about his two youngest sons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were originally three of them, but one of them was kicked out of the house early and was ignored by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two who stayed by my side, although they are not too old, it is still a bit embarrassing that no one cares about them. If you want to take the initiative to attack, you can't find a suitable target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, as a direct member of the Koslow family and the younger brother of the earl, it is entirely possible to consider marrying a great nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the identities of the two youngest sons are a bit embarrassing. It's fine if they don't have the same mother as Hudson, and the mother is not from aristocratic background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this one, the possibility of marriage with a big noble is cut off. After all, everyone wants to save face in the circle, and the current situation of the Koslow family is not enough for everyone to let go of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are the big nobles unable to climb up, but even the middle nobles are not interested. Even if Baron Redman showed his intention to marry, he was only willing to introduce distant collateral children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, people also have to conduct background checks before marriage. After figuring out the relationship between the two of them and Hudson, the head of the family, they were directly judged as having no marriage value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little nobles who are further down don't care much about this, but Baron Redman is a little unwilling. To be exact, Mrs. Anna was not reconciled, blowing the wind beside her pillow every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How is it, sir?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the question, Redman responded angrily: \"What else can I do, I was rejected again!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, let's talk about it in a few years, anyway, the two of them are still young, so it's okay to delay it for a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm usually busy, so when you're free, you can urge the two of them to practice more. If he could become a great knight before the age of twenty, he would not have to worry about not having a good marriage. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being rejected one after another, Redman no longer has illusions about the marriage of his two younger sons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called becoming a great knight before the age of twenty is purely a picture. Throughout the history of the Koslow family, there is only one Hudson seedling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter where they are, there are only a few geniuses who cultivate, and the vast majority are just ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, I will urge them to practice, but...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Mrs. Anna could finish speaking, Redman forcibly interrupted: \"There are not so many buts, there is nothing perfect in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If not, then lower the bar. Even the boss and the second child didn't climb high branches, so why not leave them alone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, in Redman's eyes, the three former sons still hold more weight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he loves his younger son more, it is based on his leisure time. Unless the next two minors have past performance, it will be difficult to change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, or let Hudson come forward and help...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, Redman immediately reprimanded with a changed face: \"Shut up! Ignorant fool, do you want to marry someone, or do you want to make enemies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, marriage has always been a matter of two surnames. How can one force a marriage!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop here, if you let me hear it again, hum! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eyes full of anger startled Mrs. Anna. Reason told her that Redman was really angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the twenty years of their marriage, there were only a handful of scenes where Redman was so violent, and every time he became violent, something big happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe seeing that Mrs. Anna was frightened, Redman's anger slowly calmed down. It was not easy for the Koslow family to be revived, and he didn't want to affect the development of the family because of one of his reckless actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, I have been busy building bridges for the children of the family, all of which are trying to win connections for the family. Even if the marriage partners are minor nobles, the Koslow family has a lot of people!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't compare with the Dalton family's background, it's better than having more people. With the fertility of the Koslow family, as long as a stable development environment is obtained, the population of the next generation will surely explode further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is nothing to do. After decades, all the nobles in the province have become relatives of their own family, and the family foundation will be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To implement this plan, the precondition must be to ensure that every marriage is a marriage, not an enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, Hudson is the only one who knows about this plan. As the specific executor, Redman does not allow anyone to destroy the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is the greatest contribution he can make to the family, and it is also the value of life in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hurry up and load the car, we are leaving tomorrow, what kind of slow talk is this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the start of the territory replacement plan, this scene has continued to be staged everywhere. It is hard to leave the homeland, and it is inevitable that the serfs will have resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that even they are the wealth of the nobles, and their ideas obviously cannot affect the implementation of the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slow delay is their last stubbornness. The Baojia chiefs who were transferred from the headquarters to organize the relocation, after finishing their ideological work, their patience was slowly exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reprimanding is considered gentle, and those who have a bad temper are directly kicked up. The soldiers who had just started patrolling went over to dissuade them for a while, but later saw that the progress was slow to get up, so they didn't bother to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under high pressure, the relocation work officially started. There were a lot of small episodes in the middle, but finally there was no big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is not how strong the organization ability of the mountain territory is. The most important thing is that Hudson recruited 20,000 troops and sent them over to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relocation of 150,000 people was escorted by 20,000 troops. If there is a big mess, then there is a real problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that these 150,000 people are not high-quality population. After all, these fiefdoms were all turned into unclaimed lands during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original lords and lords all died on the battlefield, and naturally few of the serfs who went to the battlefield with them were able to come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of young and strong people were lost, and most of the rest were old, weak, women and children. It must be worrying to put it on other lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous region is obviously an exception. During the war, Hudson abducted many young and strong soldiers back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the one-time recruitment of 20,000 troops, it can be seen that this is by no means what the original population of the mountain region can gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of territorial replacement is not only about concentrating territories, but also a grand strategy for population balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the long relocation team, Andrea looked depressed. He, the sad city lord, has only been in office for more than three months and is about to move again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made Xueyue City too far away from the mountain territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally expected to make achievements here, so as to go back to get a good position, but now it is obviously a failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's sad to think about it. When I was in charge of intelligence work, I didn't make outstanding achievements; when I was the lord of Xueyue City, I still didn't have any achievements that I could show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more and more talents in the mountain area, and he has been unable to produce results for a long time. If this situation continues, he will be marginalized sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just me, it's okay to be marginalized, but he came here with a mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a lot of effort to get mixed into the higher-ups of the territory. If he was kicked out of the power center due to his own factors, he would have no way to explain to the boss behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighed deeply, he knew he couldn't sit still. You must do something in the next changing situation, otherwise not only will you end up miserably, but your family will also end up with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With the establishment of the Territory's position as a Warcraft breeding center, conflicts have also increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the arrival of personnel from major forces, past hatred and conflicts have also been brought over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past month, more than 30 conflicts, large and small, broke out in the territory, and there were three big scenes where he personally came forward to mediate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each of them has a strong background, and it is too difficult to restrain their behavior. So that Hudson can only choose to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the development of the territory is not affected and the conflict does not involve other people, he will turn a blind eye to the conflicts between the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this laissez-faire approach did not improve the situation, but worsened the security of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These **** have caused too much trouble, if they continue to let it go, it will lead to disaster sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's all talk about it, is there any way to solve the current deterioration of law and order? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current chaos has nothing to do with Fadu. The mountain leaders have enacted relevant laws a long time ago, but they have no binding force on these big guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem is that legislation is easy, but enforcement is difficult. Many people made troubles, realized that they were in trouble, and just ran away and disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the extraordinary world, as long as a master wants to hide, it is very difficult to catch. At least Hudson doesn't have the ability to hunt down people all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The parties involved are gone, and the follow-up problems are only to be borne by the forces where they belong. In this regard, everyone is still very face-saving. If the territorial facilities are damaged, those who should lose money will lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to get to the bottom of it, but I'm sorry for the reason given: the client cannot be found, and the conviction cannot be carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the attitude is very correct, but in fact it is purely coping with the matter. How much is it worth if a fight damages a few tables, chairs and benches?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone likes to solve problems by themselves. The party that failed in the conflict also went directly to find trouble with the other party, and did not ask Hudson, the host, to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the main reason why Hudson dare not strictly control. Once it is announced that it will fully intervene in management, there is a high probability that the victim will come to him, the lord, to discuss an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the current situation is mainly caused by the gathering of major forces and the mixture of fish and dragons. It is neither convenient for us to manage, nor can we intervene in management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guards responsible for patrolling the territory, although they are all elite, most of them are ordinary people. In the face of conflicts between the masters of the major forces, they are simply powerless to stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the person is caught, the other party is also a nobleman, and may be a foreign nobleman, so it is not convenient for us to deal with it according to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ideal state is: hand over the person to the kingdom, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will negotiate with the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it's because we send people away too frequently, and now people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs avoid us when they see us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To really solve the problem, it is best to negotiate with the major forces and reach a consensus on management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or build a city for them alone, dedicated to the research and development and security personnel sent by the major forces to live in, to reduce the impact on the security of the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Michel took the lead in proposing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the magistrate of the territory, he has suffered from these people for a long time! In order to solve this trouble, the officials of the Ministry of Public Security racked their brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first I wanted to kill the chickens to scare the monkeys, but in the end the chickens were killed, but none of the monkeys were frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how serious they are, what they can do is the servants of the nobles, and they have no right to deal with the nobles themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless a certain nobleman was killed or maimed on the spot during a conflict, it was just a fight, and it was not a big deal for the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there any other way?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson continued to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, there is no good solution, but there is a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as you receive news of people fighting, you let Mr. Maxim go over, catch them and beat them hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can declare to the outside world: your dragon is in estrus, has a bad temper and likes to fight, and when he sees someone fighting, he can't help but join in itching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long time, everyone naturally knows to restrain themselves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane suggested calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using violence to control violence is not a good way, but it is the most effective way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a kind of dragon, Maxim's current status is very special. Even if they start a little harder, everyone can do nothing. At most, they will pay them a few more births during breeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a good idea, let Maxim beat up those troublemakers first, and then talk to the major forces, it will be much more convenient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's do this. In addition, the construction of places for hatching and living of cubs must also be accelerated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people to inform the major forces that Maxim has initially entered the estrus period, and ask them to arrange female beasts to come to conceive in batches. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not fooling around. Of the three cows delivered yesterday, Maxim only ate two, and the remaining cow was carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to verify, Hudson sent in several cows, sows, and female lizards one after another... In the past, there were traces of mating without exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many species are able to talk, and Hudson is also speechless about the wonderful aesthetics of the dragon in estrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the estrus belongs to the estrus, Maxim still wants to save face. At least when he is the master, he can maintain his rationality well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it may also be the effect of the mysterious compass. From the signing of the contract, the relationship between Mysterious Compass and Maxim has been established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, he uses the power of the compass to practice on weekdays, so it is not surprising that the compass can affect Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the current special situation, Hudson ordered that all women in the territory be prohibited from approaching the dragon's nest to avoid bad scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent Maxim from going out to do things after he was in heat, Hudson kept him by his side most of the time, and even let Bear Stearns watch him specially.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Moxi, since receiving Alpha's marriage intention, King George has fallen into deep thought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make this marriage and continue to deepen the alliance with the Alpha Kingdom is a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If before the orcs invaded, or if the two countries hadn't been seriously injured in the war, then this marriage is definitely worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the current situation is different. Neither the Principality of Moxi nor the Kingdom of Alpha are in a good state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several kingdoms in the middle of the country have already shown Bei Gu's interest. The original top three in the north have now become three pieces of fat in the eyes of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't take immediate action, that's because they just finished a war against the Orc Empire. It is morally unjustifiable to attack the three countries at this time, and it is easy to attract the intervention of mainland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single family is fat in the eyes of others. If two families hold together to keep warm, it might become a big fat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Warhammer Kingdom in civil strife, that has been automatically ignored by George. People don't care how to toss, but the location is good!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seemed a bit remote at first, but judging from the current situation, this remoteness itself is the best protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now bordering the Kingdom of Warhammer, apart from the Principality of Moxie, they are either small human kingdoms or ancient survivors in the ice and snow world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big human countries in the south-central region, if they want to reach out to them, they must first get rid of these human countries in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because there is no external threat that the nobles of the east and west dare to fight among themselves. Otherwise, there would be no civil war at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this marriage can be agreed to. The Alpha Kingdom seems to be seriously injured, but their foundation is solid and their resilience is strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the previous examples of orc invasions, we know how abnormal their mobilization ability is at critical moments. Even if its strength is not at its peak, it is still a powerful country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current state, they only need to rest for more than ten years to recover, and they can basically recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some countries in the central region have ideas about them, it is impossible to do it in recent years. As long as time drags on and their strength recovers to seven or eight points, the crisis will no longer exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, our situation is actually more troublesome. Although the Alpha Kingdom helped us separate several large countries, and there are small countries in the south of the principality as a buffer, but we suffered too heavy losses in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with before the war, our population has directly lost half. It can be said unceremoniously that in the next ten years, our current military strength will be the strongest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to return to your peak state, the most ideal state, you need to rest for 20 to 30 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this period, we need allies to support us. The Alpha Kingdom may not be strong enough, but they are reliable! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political marriages have always been about interests overriding everything else. As for the thoughts of the parties, it is actually not important. Even if he looked down upon Crown Prince Caesar, he still supported this marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these obvious reasons, there is another reason that cannot be said. Prime Minister Herceg is worried about luring wolves into the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allies are never as strong as possible. If it is so powerful that it is perverted, it is not an ally, but a threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current state of the Principality of Moxi, if it really chooses to form an alliance with a certain powerful country, maybe one day George has an accident, and people will occupy the magpie's nest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, the poor performance of Crown Prince Caesar has become his bonus item.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you think so too?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the balance in his mind has been tilted toward agreeing to the marriage. It's just that this idea is not firm and needs more people to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Prime Minister is right. Crown Prince Caesar may not be the best marriage partner, but it is the most suitable choice for the Principality right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to being unbearable in the military, in daily life, Crown Prince Caesar did not expose too many flaws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the currently ongoing project of the Warcraft Legion, Crown Prince Caesar also played an important role in it. In the future, it should not be difficult to be a conservative lord in charge of the Alpha Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato analyzed seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a country, the most suitable king is the best. Having just gone through a war and when the people feel at ease, the Lord of Conservation is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evaluation of Crown Prince Caesar is not low at all. As for whether he can do it, that is a matter of the future, anyway, the court has already changed people by then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the king and the courtiers, the Principality of Moxi has also reached the time of a big change in the court. There is no rush to act because of the current situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war left a lot of mess, and a little carelessness would cause a big mess. George didn't dare to change people easily at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at everyone, seeing that no one objected, George nodded slightly and said, \"Then reply to the Alpha royal family and say that we agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the royal family intervene to discuss the specific details. Our first task now is to resume production in various parts of the principality. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beda City, Earl Pierce has not been in a good mood since he returned from the last expedition to the Beast Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the construction in the mountainous area in full swing, his mood was even worse. Knowing that this is a threat from his family, he still can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has many shortcomings, and the Koslow family has even more loopholes. However, none of these exposed flaws are fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not his style to act blindly just to make trouble for the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, if we don't take action, their population migration will be completed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to his subordinates, Earl Pierce frowned. As early as when Hudson exchanged territories with various families, he took measures to obstruct the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan for the Warcraft Legion of the Persian Kingdom was released, and Hudson, who had a favorable position, successfully concluded a deal with all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the Dalton family, in order to participate in the plan, they were also forced to vote in favor of the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This vote of approval is also the core factor that prompted nobles from all over the world to agree to exchange land. The boss agreed, so naturally he couldn't ask the younger brothers to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the first step of obstruction fails, the only thing left is to make troubles in population migration. The biggest shortage in the mountainous territory is population. Without these hundreds of thousands of people, the subsequent development will be greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not easy to handle! Hudson sent all the troops in his hands to act as guards. A little trouble can't keep them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agitating immigrants to make trouble, just started, and was suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on Hudson's prestige, the nobles along the way did not dare to block their way at all, but provided them with a lot of convenience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the two families have not broken their faces after all, we can't end up fighting against them in person!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the action is too obvious and caught by the opponent, that is also a trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Earl Pierce is looking forward and backward, it's really that the current situation is not suitable for tearing apart the Koslow family. It's fine to stumbling in secret, once they face each other openly, if they are not careful, it will be a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't think that the young and energetic Hudson will choose to endure when he encounters trouble at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the troubles in the Kingdom, the Dalton family is not sure of winning if there is a real fight!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the internal structure of the southeastern province, one can see that the Dalton family is deeply rooted and has influence throughout every county; the Koslow family has many relatives and has their own people everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the two companies start working, no one can tell how everyone will stand in line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, it is inconvenient for us to make a move, which does not mean that other forces cannot make a move either!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson has offended many people all the way to the present. These people don't have as many concerns as we do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we provide them with some convenience in secret, the next thing has nothing to do with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Earl of Hudson found out the truth afterwards, it would be no big deal. You can't ask us for an explanation just because we don't do anything, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man's proposal moved Earl Pierce's heart. Looking at Hudson's journey, he stepped on the corpses of countless people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First the Holy See Cavalry and the Skull and Bones, then the Orc Empire, and then offended the Northern Noble Group to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The declining orc empire, do not need to pay attention to it for the time being. They were so busy recuperating that they didn't have time to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the other companies are different. As long as the Dalton family sends out a signal, there will be no need to worry about collaborators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget about the Skull and Bones, those cult organizations are completely out of control. If they are let in, no one can guarantee what they will do next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles and the Holy See can all hint at a wave. But keep enough boundaries, and if something happens, don't let them drag us down!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Schaefer, I will leave this matter to you. It doesn't matter how many results can be achieved, the key is to provoke conflict between the mountain leader and the two. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good neighbor, the better the development of the Mountain Territory, the more pressure the Dalton family will feel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the establishment of the Warcraft breeding base made Earl Pierce's scalp tingle. The presence of a large number of powerful forces made him unable to use many methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: secretly implementing an economic blockade, or raising commodity transit taxes, or driving up commodity prices...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This series of methods are now useless. To block the mountain territory at this moment is to oppose the major forces that have settled in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, once the price rises, it will be these foreigners who pay the bill in the end. No one's money is blown away by strong winds, and being ripped off by someone will definitely make you feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he ran into a competitor who was constantly making trouble, he rationally told him that he had to find a few more enemies for Hudson to help him share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, please rest assured! I will definitely handle this matter properly, and will not leave any clues.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Schaefer immediately promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They cannot bear the blood of the dragon, and most of the other female beasts cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the monsters sent to breed died, but fortunately, most of them survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, our original plan can basically be declared a failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comprehensive analysis of various factors: either Mr. Maxim is too violent when he is in heat, and ordinary female beasts cannot withstand the destruction; or the blood of the dragon is too strong, and the energy in the sperm can only be tolerated by monsters. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to David's report, Hudson frowned. I have to admit that scientific research burns the most money. Hundreds of high-quality female animals died, and thousands of gold coins were lost for a failed experiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary female beasts cannot be bred successfully, which means that the large-scale selling of Yalong beasts has become a bubble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can indeed get a share of the Warcraft cubs born in the breeding base, but that is only a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the prior agreement: he can take one-thirtieth of the cubs sent by the kingdom; he can take five percent of the cubs from other forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the total number is insufficient, directly extract according to a base number, and the litters will not be extracted until the gap is made up in the later breeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This ratio can be said to be quite low. But there is no way, all the big forces participating in this plan, at least compared to the mountain territories, all of them are giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of partners who are stronger than himself, Hudson's dominance is only verbal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone gave him face, so he let him make his own conditions. But the strength in his hands is not good, how dare Hudson open his mouth to everyone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the current distribution model is a condition he proposed to the major forces after careful calculation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this distribution model, the future Mountain Territory will be the earliest territory in the Northern Continent to popularize the Warcraft Legion, but this leading advantage will only be a few years at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that it is just stuck on the bottom line that everyone can accept. If the life-or-death lion really opens its mouth, the day the Warcraft Legion's plan is completed will be the time for the destruction of the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how fast it develops, Hudson doesn't think that he can have the strength to fight against other countries in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the cub share, there are naturally other compensations. For example: for every Warcraft cub born, Mr. Maxim can get 150 gold coins for nutrition compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson used his family reputation to assure everyone that all the money will be used on Maxim and will never be embezzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in addition to daily living expenses, it also includes helping Mr. Maxim repay the debts he owed in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivation is very expensive. With the experience of raising Bear Stearns, when facing Maxim, the energy to assist in cultivation was directly set at a sky-high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mysterious compass transforms the energy of magic crystals and magic cores, 98% of the handling fee will be withdrawn, and the remaining 2% will be fed back to Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoying a 50-fold high-priced auxiliary package every day, Maxim, who was ready for prostitution, had no psychological burden at all, and soon owed Hudson a huge debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can do anything about the giant dragon that can only get in and out. But the money Maxim made now has to be passed on from Master Hudson, so naturally he has to give priority to repaying the previous debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's fine if the plan fails, this is a low probability event. If ordinary domestic animals and wild animals can successfully breed with giant dragons, I am afraid that the monster legions of all major forces have been formed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Department of Warcraft continues to send people to monitor the breeding situation. The next female Warcraft will be pregnant and give birth, and all processes must be recorded in detail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs wants to speed up the population statistics of the territory, and at the same time organize personnel to conduct a talent test on men and women aged 8 to 15 in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people will be the objects we will focus on training next. All those who are talented in cultivation will be trained and trained by the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure, as long as you experience a lot, you will gradually get used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to exercise your mental endurance, you need to configure magic potions, so that you can quickly adapt to failure in storage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, Hudson has not been idle. While dealing with territorial affairs, he was recruiting talents everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the title of Dragon Knight is easy to use. The guy who didn't pay attention to the mountain leader before is not so absolute when he chooses the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no real masters, but there are still many people recruited from magic apprentices, low-level magicians, and low-level knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory magician group was also formed. Among them, the biggest name is naturally Hudson, the mage, and then there are an intermediate magician, three junior magicians, and fifteen magic apprentices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a lineup, putting on the name of the magician group, is purely putting money on their own face. According to mainland practice, magic apprentices cannot be considered magicians at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely useless to send them out to fight, but they can barely make do if they are used as scientific research migrant workers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident. The current main job of these people is to help Master Hudson in the laboratory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, Melissa would also enter the laboratory to study some weird things, and these people would also be called to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they have another task, to test the magical talents of the people in the territory. Hudson's requirements are not high. Based on the population base of the territory, as long as one or two hundred teenagers with magical talents can be born, it will be considered good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is always knights and warriors that can be mass-produced on a large scale. Regardless of whether the talent is good or bad, at least they can carry out early training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mages are such talented professions, it depends purely on whether God appreciates them. If you are good, you can get it right; if you don't, it's useless to cultivate it casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a luxurious courtyard in Beida City, an old man was listening to the report in his hand, and suddenly his face changed drastically: \"Is this the information you collected?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all nonsense, and there is no valuable information at all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major forces clashed in the mountainous territory, let you add fuel to the fire in the past and intensify the conflicts among the various families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But look at the foolishness of yourselves!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the gangsters were not moving, they would fight and fight every now and then, and a few died from time to time. As soon as you pass by, peace will immediately come down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of provoking conflicts, they sent their own people to prison. In order to get him back, he almost exposed the organization! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, Kevin has also been unlucky. Originally, because of the redemption of the blood moon horn, he was promoted to an important position in the headquarters; but because Hudson's identity information was wrong, he was demoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task this time is to destroy the Alpha Kingdom's Warcraft Legion plan. After working hard for a long time, they finally found a loophole, but as soon as their people passed by, the situation took a turn for the worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major forces have formed a law enforcement team together to deal with conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who provoked were not executed, but were hanged on the flagpole for two days, and a wave of social deaths came directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He ruthlessly killed chickens to make an example of monkeys, and soon shocked everyone. The aristocratic gentlemen who were originally awesome have settled down, and it will be difficult to do things again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The intelligence personnel of the Holy See who were in charge of instigating the incident happened to be sent to the door at this juncture. The price of fanning the flames is going to jail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, the organization spends money to redeem it; if you are unlucky, you go directly to the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the identity is exposed or not, everyone knows this kind of thing, there is no need to say it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we have done our best. The major forces attach great importance to the plan of the Warcraft Legion, and have adopted severe measures to suppress all conflicts, leaving no room for us to manipulate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, we have just received news that the Earl of Hudson has reached a land exchange agreement with many minor nobles, and the population is being relocated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can take action to sabotage, then blame the Dalton family and provoke a big war between the two families, it will definitely affect the Alpha Kingdom's Warcraft Legion plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged man said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was forced out, and the previous plan failed, and someone has to be responsible for it. As the person responsible for the implementation, that is the natural backer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when he received the news, the Dalton family, the overlord of the southeastern province, acquiesced in their attack on the immigration team. The opportunity to commit crimes and make meritorious deeds that comes to your door must be seized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The matter of Hudson's organization of immigrants has long been aroused. It seems to be a good shot, but they sent 20,000 troops to **** them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these territories are scattered, the strength of each escorting army is not less than a thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These troops all followed Earl Hudson from the orc battlefield, and their combat effectiveness is definitely not comparable to that of ordinary city guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total journey of immigration and relocation is only a short distance, and the duration cannot be too long. It is too late to mobilize reinforcements from outside now, the only thing that can be used is our strength in several nearby provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a large-scale operation, I am afraid that many foundations will be exposed. Even if we take action, we can only selectively attack all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know how much damage it can cause to the enemy, but just framing the Dalton family is a big problem. In case of being captured by the enemy, our power hidden in the Alpha Kingdom will be dealt with more cruelly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin resolutely refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Framing the blame is easy to say, but if you actually carry out specific operations, you will find that it is full of various problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is strength. Under the continuous suppression of the Kingdom, the power of the Holy See hidden in the Alpha Kingdom is also declining day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many aristocrats who had been in close contact with them have cut them off one after another for their own benefit. The power that the Holy See can use now is actually not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, my lord, this time it's a signal sent by the Dalton family. As long as they provide convenience for our actions, Earl Hudson will not believe it if they say that it has nothing to do with the attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We just want to provoke conflicts between the two families. We only need to launch an attack on the immigration team, and there is no need to wipe out the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conflict between us and the Alpha Kingdom has not lasted for a day or two. Even if we are found out about the latter matter, it will be nothing more than adding a new enmity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the operation is completed, everyone finds a place to hide. Even if the Earl of Hudson wanted to be held accountable, he could only put the account on the Dalton family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Naderson, Duke Thorsten felt a toothache when he looked at the information collected by his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the Koslow family continue to be pragmatic and grow stronger, he sees it in his eyes and is anxious in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Provide us with convenience and create an opportunity to destroy the Hudson immigration. Earl Pierce, this is brain water!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Duke Thorsten tore the letter in his hand to pieces. If he has the ability to make a move, he definitely doesn't mind a wave of cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Lochnard family and the Koslow family are mortal enemies, and it is not too much to use any means. Even if the Dalton family has a black hand against the Koslow family, it doesn't matter if he helps to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them do it themselves, and that would be hilarious. If he had the opportunity to make a move, he would have done it long ago, so why should someone come over to remind him!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crux of the problem is that the Northern Noble Group is only a regional noble alliance after all, and its strength is all concentrated in the northern region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless times of infiltration to the south, they were all surrounded by southern nobles, and they couldn't stand at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the Lochnard family is in the southeastern province, and apart from a few spies, they have no armed forces at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sent people there temporarily, reckoning that the team would attract the attention of the nobles along the way as soon as they left the Northland. When they arrived in the southeast province, they also sent their heads in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After standing up and wandering for a few steps, Duke Thorsten immediately realized something was wrong. It's not that the northern aristocratic group has no armed forces in the southeastern province, it's just that they can't command this armed force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sons of the Northland nobles who went south four years ago either failed to start a business and collapsed in the middle way; or they changed camps and defected to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in the eyes of the outside world, these forces that have a blood relationship with them are still considered to be the forces of the northern noble camp, and at least some of them can still be controlled by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Duke Thorsten smiled wryly to himself. Earl Pierce thinks highly of them. Even if the two parties still have contact, why should they let them work for them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobility is realistic. As long as the immigrant team that attacked Hudson in the southeastern province participated, they would never come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the children of the northern nobles over there were really instructed to do it, they would have been sold by others as soon as the news was delivered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to tell Earl Pierce directly, and we are powerless to talk about this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let him boldly send someone to do it, and when things are done, we Locknard can be responsible for taking the blame for him! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Thorsten said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he couldn't help thinking: Let's make trouble, the bigger the mess, the better!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the entire northern aristocratic group is having a hard time. Facing the joint suppression of the kingdom's major forces, they can only swallow their anger now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, the person in charge changed, and many families did not make good arrangements. It can be said that from top to bottom, the northern aristocratic camp is suffering from internal and external troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what they most want to see is the infighting among the major forces in the kingdom to reduce the political pressure from outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the current fiery Warcraft Legion project, the northern nobles are in a marginal state. In name, they participated in it, but the quota they got did not match their strength at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a few emerging big nobles, they all get more shares than the Lochnard family, and they are almost surpassed by the middle nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that it is unfair, I still can only endure it. In political terms, that means they contributed the least to the project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Thorsten doesn't have a big picture and is unwilling to contribute to the Warcraft Legion project. It's really that King Caesar III didn't give them the opportunity to make greater contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When assigning tasks, apart from collecting female beasts for public tasks, sending magic pharmacy masters to participate in pharmacy research and development, and providing experimental funds, they have nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Providing security for the project, handling logistics, and coordinating the relationship between all parties... These tasks that anyone can do are assigned to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Has the man not come yet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin couldn't help asking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the immigration team was slower than he expected. Hiding in the woods, feeding the mosquitoes for several hours, still did not wait for anyone to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Kevin didn't need to lead the team himself for such an errand. But out of concern for his subordinates, he still chose to come over in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the work of ambush must be done by professional teams. Those who work in intelligence are really not suitable for the job of leading soldiers to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An experienced general would find something wrong here just by looking from a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the enemy's vanguard is less than two miles away from us, and we can see it right away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the situation has changed. In addition to the army of the mountain leader, the **** team also includes the guards of the nobles along the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Kevin frowned. The nobles along the way also ran over to help the enemy, which he did not expect in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The increase in the strength of the enemy will definitely not be a good thing for ambushers like them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, continue to send people to stare at the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrow is on the string, and I have to send it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the enemy is, the team has ambushed them. Even if they want to retreat at such a short distance, there will be too little time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once their whereabouts are exposed, they will not ambush the enemy next, but wait to be strangled by the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Dalton family, who secretly provided them with convenience, would throw stones at them to prove that they did not collude with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobles is so simple and unpretentious. Regardless of whether there is collusion with the Holy See or not, as long as you are more active when strangling the Holy See, it can prove that the two parties have no collusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is that only children care about it, and adults only have pros and cons in their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Closer, closer. Looking at the enemy team that was getting closer, Kevin showed a happy smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is not good, my lord. The enemies in front of us are all on the armor. We are afraid that we will be sent...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, a rain of arrows hit the top of his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"ah…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few unlucky guys who didn't hide well, unfortunately shot an arrow and let out a scream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to remind now, Kevin also realizes that his group has been exposed. Although I don't know where the problem occurred, as long as the traces are exposed, it is definitely not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Kevin's order, the killers who were ambushing in the woods rushed out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the land knight, Kevin took the lead and rushed to the forefront of the team. However, his target was not the enemy army in front, but the officials in charge of immigration behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter how many enemies are wiped out, this operation is mainly for making trouble. After killing three people in a row, Kevin suddenly couldn't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The familiar face in front of him seemed to be a spy trained by him. Previously, in order to monitor the mountain territory, they had placed many spies in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at her attire, she seems to be doing well now. Ordinary intelligence personnel will die when they die. This kind of intelligence personnel who have climbed to a certain position cannot give up easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back at the three dead people, he felt familiar with two of them, as if he had seen them somewhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that he had killed the wrong person, Kevin was annoyed for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he recognized the other party's identity. They don't recognize him with makeup on, so he can do whatever kind of ruthless moves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an inattentive effort, he was actually hit by the opponent's miniature magic crossbow. If he hadn't reacted fast enough to avoid the critical point in time, he would have been sent to see the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being wounded by his own people, Kevin also wanted to cry but had no tears. Not caring about the battlefield, he hurriedly fled with injuries. While running, he did not forget to order:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is already prepared, retreat quickly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden order directly confused the killers who participated in the attack. It is obviously unreasonable to retreat after having just engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But seeing that their bosses were all wounded and running away, all the killers didn't care to continue fighting, and all took out their own skills to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the team involved in the attack disappeared into the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While patrolling the team, counting the casualties, and thinking about this unexpected attack, Luke was very confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the battle just now, the enemy had a chance to attack him, but suddenly hesitated. Could it be one of our own?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was one of our own, it would be a disaster if we used a magic crossbow to sneak attack just now. Regardless of which part of the organization it is, the status of a person cannot be low because of his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then he dismissed this terrible idea. In the past six months, he hasn't contacted the organization. If such a big event is really going on, there's no reason not to notify him!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the cooperation of him, the person in charge of immigration, with internal and external cooperation, this team can definitely be wiped out today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are engaged in intelligence, if they can go back, who wants to stay outside and lurk in danger!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few years in the undercover mountain territory, Luke has aged by more than ten years. On the surface, it is because of overwork, but in fact, he is more scared out of fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the enemy attack just now caused us 78 casualties, of which 26 were killed and 52 were injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the enemy's skill is too powerful, we dare not divide our troops to pursue, so only poor sixty-three people were captured. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The top priority is to let other teams strengthen their vigilance to prevent similar things from happening again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation reported below, the enemy has dispatched hundreds of people, and it is impossible for so many people to act together without leaving traces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before we were aware of it, someone must have provided them with cover. There are only a few companies in the southeastern province with this ability, and even fewer dare to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we have sent people to keep an eye on the Dalton family. If they mobilize their troops, they shouldn't be unaware of any abnormalities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we underestimated this southeast overlord, they still have more hidden powers that we have not noticed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane analyzed solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, things were beyond his expectations. Most of the information about the Dalton family in the Mountain Territory comes from the Holliser family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rise of the Koslow family, the two strongest families in the province had no less friction, and they understood each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the decision to go north, these materials about the Dalton family have been packaged and handed over to Hudson by the Earl of Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the territory replacement, Hudson had sent people to keep an eye on the hidden power of the Dalton family early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This possibility is unlikely. Judging from the strength revealed by the enemy, although there are many people involved in the attack, there are not many masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Dalton family takes action against us, it will definitely be a thunderous blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the battle report, the enemy obviously still has the strength to continue fighting, and as a result, they retreated directly when dozens of people were killed in battle, which is obviously unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is likely that there is a certain powerful force who wants to make troubles, frame us, and lead us astray, so they do this on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real black hand behind the scenes may not necessarily be targeting us, but may also be targeting the Dalton family or the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forces that want to see the plan of the Warcraft Legion fail are not one or two. If we can't find a breakthrough in other places, it makes sense to use us as a knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many forces suspected of taking action, and it is still impossible to infer who the real culprit is based on the information we currently have! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Rudolph's words, Hudson also became confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from home alone, finding enemies couldn't be easier. Looking at the family history of the Koslow family, there are only a handful of big forces that have offended them. After a casual deduction, you can guess seven or eight points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amplified Alpha Kingdom, then there is no way to guess. Hudson has not completely smoothed out the current international relations, let alone looking for the real culprit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Check slowly, don't be too anxious. Right now, our task is to complete the immigration and relocation as soon as possible. Who is behind the scenes is not that important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the enemy left dozens of corpses behind. It shouldn't be difficult to find out their identities before they were alive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Peel and cramp layer by layer, and one day they will be able to dig them out. When the time comes, slowly settle accounts with them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson snapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He yelled fiercely, but in fact Hudson had nothing in his heart. Even though he kept a low profile as much as possible, the current mountain territory inevitably became a whirlpool of storms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more things you know, the more questions you have to think about, and the more things you are afraid of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the current confusion, it would be a big trouble if a big force that could not be provoked was found out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't retaliate, you will appear to be too cowardly, and it will easily cause people to set up landslides; if you take action to retaliate, you will not have enough strength in your hands, and there is a high probability that you will humiliate yourself if you make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest advantage of the Koslow family at present is that the family base is large enough. If they turned against a powerful and powerful force, and they resorted to shady methods, this advantage would collapse in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these foundations, Hudson is at best a more powerful casual cultivator. If you want to build a big power again, you can only go to a cult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a matter of camp selection, but a group of people who control the right to speak say that you are a member of a cult, then you'd better be a member of a cult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a loud bang, Hudson made his own alchemy furnace and was sacrificed again. If he didn't hide fast enough, he would almost be disgraced again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experienced one failure after another, Hudson had to admit that he was not a genius in refining medicine at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hold the recipe and follow the instructions step by step. You will fail at least nine times out of ten. There is only one success, and there may be various unsatisfactory ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, the vast majority of alchemists on the mainland are at this level. If you want to fully master the preparation of a magic potion, you have to rely on the experience of failure to pile up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Hudson's original Pill Furnace Medicine Method, it is purely a test of luck. Due to the unqualified raw materials of the pill furnace, blasting the furnace is a routine operation, and it is an accident not to explode the furnace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether it is fried or not, the key is to see the results. The same magic potion formula can always produce many strange products in Hudson's pill furnace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, special products can be born, which is the result of infusing energy into the furnace through the mysterious compass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this most critical step is omitted, it will basically be a batch of medicinal porridge. The specific effect, who eats will know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the fryer is needed, but still being so persistent, it is because of what Hudson made, and sometimes it is really useful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the previous Xiongxiong brand feed pills, Julong brand Zhuangyang pills, desire fascination pills, beast evolution pills...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the dragon brand Zhuangyang Pill, which is a must-have treasure for Maxim to be able to control all kinds of beasts. Otherwise, in the face of a steady stream of female beasts, the dragon's waist would not be able to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beast Evolution Pill is even more powerful. This thing directly evolved Hudson's bull into a monster. Even the lowest level of Warcraft is also a remarkable achievement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the side effects are a bit serious. According to hundreds of previous experiments, the beasts that ate the beast evolution pills have never been born or died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it is because the number of experimental bases is too small, and the success rate cannot be counted so far. In short, apart from any bull, there is only one wild mouse that has completed evolution so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also tried to feed it to monsters, but he was disgusted by all kinds of people. Anyway, his own dragons and bears refused to open their mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After deliberately catching a wild monster and feeding it forcibly, there was no response. Even if the dose is increased by thirty times, it will only cause diarrhea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't see the benefits, but actually made the monster collapse. After conducting several experiments, he finally couldn't stand the torture and died directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you're on and on...fryer!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Melissa's outrageous laugh, Hudson replied unceremoniously: \"Smile so happily, did the magic potion you made succeed this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course not!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm only an intermediate magician, and I'm just getting involved in refining medicine. Failure is a normal thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike a certain mage, who can create his own system, if he wants to change the magical pharmacy of the mainland, he still makes himself ashamed every day. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you fail, the key is to have someone to accompany you. If you watch others succeed every day, and you keep failing all by yourself, it is estimated that no one can bear this kind of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson and Melissa are typical examples of hard work. Now they have developed to the point of making fun of each other's failures and seeking comfort for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You're outright jealous. Anyway, I'm a mage now, and you're a little mage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they work hard for another twenty years, some people may not be able to reach the threshold of a mage. Still laughing at me here, who gave you the guts? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already held Melissa in his arms. Looking at the restless hands, it seems that a big battle is about to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, let go! Don't mess around here, or I will get angry.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson stopped decisively. In his mouth, he yelled hard: \"See if you dare to laugh at me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it happens again next time, I won't…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish speaking, Melissa suddenly showed signs of vomiting. His face also turned pale, and Hudson was so frightened that he hurriedly released his magic to check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mages work part-time as doctors, which is also a feature of the continent of Aslant. Almost high-level magicians need to know some knowledge in this area, otherwise they will not be able to make potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, she slowly said, \"Melissa, you seem to be pregnant!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This news not only frightened Melissa, but also frightened Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took less than three months from getting married to the present, and I won the bid, which is really unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are you sure you didn't lie to me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How could I lie to you about this kind of thing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hurriedly assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had heard for a long time that the Koslow family had a powerful seeding talent. He thought it was a rumor at first, but he didn't expect it to be verified so soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel, who has been with her for a longer time, is not pregnant because both of them are deliberately contraceptive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't want to have an illegitimate child before the big marriage, and spread it to make people laugh; Isabel wanted to pursue a higher realm of cultivation, and was unwilling to conceive and have a child so early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the succession to the title of female title was not too far behind, even close relatives could not compare with it, I am afraid that those nobles who only have daughters who are on the verge of extinction will rush to the Koslow family to **** their son-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter how good the relationship between the relatives of the clan is, it is not as close as one's own direct blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newlyweds hadn't had enough of their sweet life when a third party stepped in, but this third party was still waiting on him like a baby, and Hudson was speechless for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you knew it earlier, you should use contraception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this can only be in his own mind. If he dared to speak out, not only Melissa would fight with him, but all the elders of the Koslow family would come over to do ideological work for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not popular to say that more children are more blessings in the Aslant Continent, for a great nobleman, it is definitely better to have more children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A thriving population is an important sign of a family's prosperity. Those families that have been passed down for several generations in a row, from the outside world, seem to have lost the favor of the Lord of Dawn and are about to perish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wife of the lord is pregnant, but it is a symbolic event, which caused a sensation in the entire mountain region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was immersed in joy, and even the shadow left by the attack on the relocation team was diluted a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Melissa didn't stop her, Hudson would have a celebration. Being a human being in two lives, it is hard to usher in the first child, it is impossible not to pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a male, this is the future owner of the mountain collar; even if it is a daughter, it is also the treasure of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the birth of boys and girls, as long as the offspring of Hudson are born, it proves that the body of the lord and his wife can give birth, and the hearts of the people in the territory will soon stabilize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beda City, Kevin, who returned home with injuries all over his body, had a gloomy and terrifying expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the sudden accident before, the connection with the hidden area buried in the mountain was temporarily interrupted, and a catastrophe occurred unexpectedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't exchange information in time, so that they made a wrong judgment, and the carefully planned attack actually hit their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even more detrimental was that he, the person in charge, was not injured by the enemy's knife; instead, he was plotted against by his own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he couldn't blame him yet. In the case of deliberately hiding his identity, the other party didn't even know that he was one of his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a coincidence happened to collide, and thinking about it made him feel depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking the healing potion, Kevin, who was physically and mentally exhausted, forcibly suppressed his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the demoralized crowd, he said angrily, \"Why is everyone silent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just a mission failure, just find a way to get it back from other places, don't act like a dead parent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you should recuperate those who are wounded, and clean up those who should be cleaned up. It doesn't matter if the action fails, but the organization's message must be well hidden. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was easy on the mouth, but panicked in the heart. This muddle-headed failure could not be reported to the headquarters at all, and even the news was deliberately blocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if the matter is passed back, everyone will only think that Kevin is incompetent, and even a well-planned attack can sneak attack on \"his own people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, what happened this time was completely accidental. The main reason is that the enemy's strength is too strong, otherwise our operation would have been successful.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Kevin's anger flared up again. What a **** accident, he ordered the retreat entirely on his own initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing with frame-ups requires someone to cooperate. If all the spies sent by the organization were killed by their own people, who would be responsible for diverting the enemy's attention?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a local snake, if you investigate in the right direction, you will be able to find clues sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Vagolding, are you questioning my command ability?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin couldn't help but questioned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the main person responsible for the failure of this operation, Kevin didn't even have the intention to shirk his responsibility. After all, he would never report this kind of bad luck, and he doesn't care about taking responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, I... dare not... I didn't mean that...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at Wagolding, who was scared to pee, Kevin had no intention of continuing to pursue it. Now he is already thinking about how to restore the contact with the spies sent abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of confidentiality, the one-line contact has been adopted until now. Even the spies don't know each other's identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person in charge of the intelligence work in the mountain area had an accident half a year ago. Immediately afterwards, a large-scale personnel transfer occurred there, and no one could be found at the original contact method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a large organization develops to a certain level, a series of disadvantages such as dereliction of duty, fishing, and bureaucracy will inevitably appear, and the Holy See is naturally no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arranging new liaison personnel, they have been waiting for the spies sent abroad to find them by themselves. It's a pity that everyone has been transferred out of the territory, so naturally there is no chance to come to meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you are a spy, your vigilance must be high. I have been playing like that for a long time. If I suddenly change my original working method and take the initiative to come to the door to restore contact, the other party will definitely be suspicious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost trust, follow-up intelligence collection will become a problem. Maybe their people were reported by their \"own people\" just after they found them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The servants were so frightened that they rushed out of the way, fearing that they would be silenced if they heard something they shouldn't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl calm down, things are not that bad. Although the migration plan of the enemy was not destroyed, it also established a big enemy for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gang of northern nobles did not make a move, but the people of the Holy See really did.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides have each other's blood glued on each other, I don't believe that they can live in peace. Next, we just need to find an opportunity to expose the identity of the attacker and guide Earl Hudson to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's not a good product.

Just wait and see, he will definitely take revenge in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said full of fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being targeted by an enemy with unlimited potential is not a good choice. But we are neighbors, and we can't avoid it even if we want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson, who was immersed in the joy of being a father, soon received bad news. There was a problem with the pillar industry of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, the production capacity was frantically expanded, and now it is finally time to suffer the backlash. Even if Hudson ordered production cuts in advance, the steel industry in the Mountain Territory still suffered a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, this is the fiscal revenue and expenditure report of the territory last month. Without considering the immigration expenditure, our fiscal deficit increased by 15,000 gold coins compared to October, and the total monthly fiscal deficit exceeded the 40,000 mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the food industry, animal husbandry industry, and service industry, driven by the World of Warcraft breeding base, have all achieved considerable growth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiscal deficit increased rapidly, mainly due to the impact on the steel industry. The investment of major powers on the prairie is lower than expected, and the demand for iron products has dropped significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the shrinking market, a number of chambers of commerce announced the termination of order delivery last month, and all domestic iron product manufacturers have been impacted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under your deployment, we chose to preemptively ship to the market and stop the loss in time, but the market collapsed faster than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to October, the price of iron products has generally dropped by more than 40%, and there are signs of continued decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current price situation, most iron product manufacturers are approaching the cost line, and manufacturers without mines have even begun to lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our steel production cost is slightly lower than that of other peers, at the current price, we can only maintain a small profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The profits of the iron and steel industry collapsed, covering up the profit growth of other industries, leading to a sharp expansion of the fiscal deficit of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This effect will last for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, it will take two years at the earliest before the income growth brought by other industries in the territory can make up for the impact of the lack of profits in the steel industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual situation may be even worse. The economic growth brought about by the Warcraft breeding base will gradually level off after the peak period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the steel industry does not recover for a long time, if the territory wants to achieve a balance of income and expenditure, I am afraid that it will have to wait for the land reclamation project to achieve a major breakthrough and fully achieve food self-sufficiency. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Jacob's report, Hudson immediately fell silent. The industrial structure of the mountainous territory is partial, and it is not a matter of a day or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapse of the profiteering steel industry directly pushed up the fiscal deficit of the territory, but this was only the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the original infrastructure was successfully received in this territorial replacement, it is inevitable to continue to invest after the big immigration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, tinkering must be indispensable. Some unreasonable water conservancy projects and roads now have to be re-planned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, these projects have costs. Even if labor costs nothing, people still have to eat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, Hudson is not a person who can stay idle. He starts a new project every now and then, and all of these need to spend money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the situation is not that bad. Except for the steel industry, the territory is still developing in a good way in general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current huge food shortage is largely due to the emergence of the Warcraft breeding base, which has sharply increased the demand for meat and stimulated the development of animal husbandry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After deducting the impact of this part, in fact, our food gap has been continuously decreasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, after the completion of the immigration plan, we can basically meet more than 80% of our own food needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the development of animal husbandry has occupied a lot of agricultural land and consumed a lot of food, which makes the food crisis seem serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble of the fiscal deficit is even less of a problem. The downturn in the steel industry cannot last for a long time. After all, this is a monopoly industry. When the inventory is almost exhausted, the market will recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, we still have the canal project to look forward to. Once this project is implemented next year, the traffic in the territory will be greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if ocean trade is not considered for a short period of time, we can catch some fish in the past to make up for the lack of meat in the territory, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worst of all, we can also organize people to produce salt in the past. Even if we don't take it out for sale, we can save tens of thousands of gold coins every year just for our own use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the economy continues to develop at such a high speed, the fiscal deficit of the territory will soon be wiped out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said optimistically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the traditional feudal economic model, the economic development model of fiscal deficit is not popular. Without a mature financial market for financing, Hudson would not dare to be so radical if he had money in his pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, if a major power has a huge financial deficit, either the military expenditure increases too fast during the war; or it is the end of the dynasty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unknown is always scary. Facing the territory's rising fiscal deficit, the management inevitably fell into panic. At this time, Hudson had to come out to appease people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the reality is cruel, but the future is bright. The big pie must be painted, otherwise everyone will worry about the deficit every day, how can they work with peace of mind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all limited by the times, leaving Hudson with a lot of ideas, but there is no way to realize them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Up to now, the core industry developed by the mountainous territory still stays in the traditional feudal economy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to agriculture and animal husbandry, the economy is mainly dependent on the steel industry. In a short period of time, this pillar was difficult to play a role, and he had to extend his tentacles to another pillar industry of the feudal economy-salt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no salt mines in the mountainous territory. If it weren't for being adjacent to the sea, Hudson would have no chance to reach out to the salt industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the monopoly structure of the salt industry has already taken shape, and it is also difficult for latecomers to join in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is forced insertion, all you can do is business with acquaintances, and the market size is limited, which is doomed to make it difficult to make huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce unnecessary troubles, Hudson refrained from reaching out before his own power extended to the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, with reference to the situation in Port Hansen, the opening of the canal will indeed benefit the economic development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our commercial prosperity can reach half of theirs, it will be able to create huge economic benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is the prosperity of Hansen Port, not only the port problem, but also the Dalton family factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearly one-fifth of the ships entering and leaving the port each year are merchant ships of the Dalton family. It can be said that the local economy was driven by the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to follow suit, we must build our own fleet, which is another huge expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is a shortage of excellent navigators everywhere. In a short period of time, it is difficult to gather enough talents in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest developing the salt industry first, and then gradually intervene in ocean trade to build our naval fleet after we have accumulated enough funds. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rudolph hastily persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the frightened expression that he is really afraid that Hudson will propose in the next moment: to build a naval fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the financial officer of the territory, what Rudolph was most afraid of was Hudson's unrestrained thoughts that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the mountainous area is thriving, but it is all made of money. In the Warcraft breeding base, many female beasts have already entered the pregnancy state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different monsters have different pregnancy cycles, and the fastest cubs will be born in the first half of next year. After the cubs are distributed according to the agreement, the mountain leader will add another group of big money swallowers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft are not as easy to feed as livestock. People want to eat meat. Rudolph didn't feel bad about the little meat. The key is that if you want to shorten the growth cycle of monsters, you must use a lot of magic potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of heroic \"krypton gold\" training method is destined to be impossible to be cheap. It can be said that the \"Warcraft Legion\" has been burned out with money since its birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Sir Rudolph. The naval fleet is a matter of the future. In a short time, our military development will focus on the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Air Force, it is the top priority of the next development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the threat of piracy that may be induced after the port is opened, we can let the Air Force handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, you can also develop the army of monsters in the sea and use it as an auxiliary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, we have natural advantages, and there is no need to follow in the footsteps of others! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be disdainful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ocean battle is not something that a small lord like him is qualified to play. Even if the mountains lead the whole people to sail, they cannot support a strong army at sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not qualified to fight for hegemony, then change your strategy and focus on defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just to deal with pirates, a powerful air force can handle most emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not enough, then raise a few monsters in the sea to guard the house. The main reason is that humans cannot survive in the sea, otherwise the power of a sea monster army would be no less deterrent than those fleets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that in the whole continent, no country has been seen to develop the army of monsters in the sea. The female beasts sent over from various countries are all flying in the sky and running on the ground, but there are no ones that swim in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that everyone is unwilling to do may not necessarily be right, but the risks and benefits involved are most likely not directly proportional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson secretly rejected his unreliable idea. Following the mainstream, it is difficult to obtain excess returns, but at least you can avoid stepping on the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone steps into the same \"pit\", that \"pit\" is no longer a \"pit\", but a process that must be experienced in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Hudson is really too optimistic. After the price of steel products fell in November, the previous sharp drop continued in December.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last month, in order to rush to sell and smash the market, the mountain leader collapsed the iron products market in the kingdom, and the crisis has further expanded this month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem now is no longer the price of iron products, but the lack of enough buyers in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Iron products are not fast-moving commodities. Whether it is farm tools or pots and pans, it will be used for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden breach of contract on a huge order has lost almost the entire prairie market. How can that little liquidated damages be able to make up for it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After overcapacity and the saturation of the domestic market, there will be no market in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of products are backlogged together, and people have to be arranged for daily maintenance. The longer it takes, the higher the cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something is wrong, more and more people follow suit and sell, but there are very few buyers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The panic was brewing until December, and finally ushered in a big outbreak. The pessimistic giants are desperate to sell in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was its own market hit, but it also brought this sentiment to adjacent areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naturally, the southeast province cannot be alone. Under the impact of a large number of foreign cheap iron products, the shipment of iron products in the mountain territory was cut in half and then cut in half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The steel industry of the entire Alpha Kingdom has entered the doomsday winter. The biting cold wind was blowing, and even Hudson felt the chill at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No surprises, small and medium processors were the first to fall; followed by small and medium mine owners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the industry giants, everyone is gritting their teeth to support them, just waiting for their peers to fall first.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the face of the price of blood collapse, there is nothing Hudson can do except to reduce production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Loss-making transactions must also be done, otherwise the market will be thrown out, and it will be difficult to get it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of crisis has come so violently, in addition to the overcapacity of the industry, there is also the reason why the giants took the opportunity to reshuffle the industry and strangle their competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the breach of contract that triggered the crisis was not only the intention of the major chambers of commerce, but also some mining giants behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very common for a certain nobleman to be both a shareholder of the chamber of commerce and a steel giant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson's rise is too short, and the relationship with the major chambers of commerce in the mainland is limited to a cooperation in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone gets what they need in a fair deal, and no one owes anyone else. These secrets, people will naturally not send someone to deliberately inform him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just be envious. The establishment of a chamber of commerce is simply impossible with the current network of contacts of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When interests are involved, a little friendship can't be done at all. Those chambers of commerce all over the mainland have a large group of partners behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the immigrant team protected by heavy soldiers was attacked by people. If they ran to form a chamber of commerce, wouldn't they be robbed every day?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the crisis is not limited to the steel industry. After the war ended, all industries that revolved around the war were impacted to varying degrees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the price of steel products has plummeted, and it has also affected other industries, such as: coal mining industry, horse-drawn carriage manufacturing and other related industrial chains, all of which have ushered in a cold winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the industry and commerce of the Alpha Kingdom is underdeveloped, and it does not account for a large proportion of the kingdom's economy. Most of the practitioners were serfs attached to the nobility. Even if the economic crisis broke out, there was no such thing as layoffs and salary cuts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impact of the crisis on the lives of the people at the bottom is almost zero. However, the chill was still passing, and the first to feel the chill was Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who suffered heavy losses in the crisis took the bonds issued by the kingdom to offset their taxes. Originally it was only the loss of noble gentlemen,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just for the autumn tax, there are war bonds as high as 4.5 million gold coins. Are they crazy?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III almost roared behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has been unwell these days, and many government affairs have been handed over to his son, and he has not paid much attention to the private actions of the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after taking a nap, the people below broke a big basket for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is theoretically feasible to use the war bonds issued by the kingdom to offset taxes. Anyway, for this kind of early redemption, the kingdom only pays the principal, and the interest on the face of the bill is directly in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, only minor nobles with poor financial resources would do this. As long as it is not swarming, it is also a relief for the kingdom to pay some war bonds in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the orderly operation of the kingdom's finances, and to earn bond interest. The great nobles who hold a large number of kingdom bonds have reached a tacit agreement long ago to hold the war bonds in their hands for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal circumstances, as long as the reputation of the kingdom does not collapse, there will be very few nobles holding bonds to offset taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, it will be hundreds of thousands of gold coins, which will not exceed 10% of the total tax payment. By repaying this debt in advance, the Ministry of Finance gritted its teeth and survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the situation is obviously different now. Affected by the war, the Alpha Kingdom received a total of seven million gold coins in autumn tax this year, of which more than four and a half million were war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that a number of big nobles have broken the tacit understanding and are throwing out the war bonds in their hands. Otherwise, the total amount of taxes contributed by the small nobles would not be so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this may be related to the domestic economic turmoil. After entering the second half of the year, there were problems in the iron products market. In November, there was an avalanche of prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the chain reaction, in December, the crisis spread to the upstream and downstream industrial chains, which in turn affected multiple industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles suffered heavy losses in this crisis. Driven by panic, everyone wanted to keep more cash in their hands, and this happened. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Chancellor of the Exchequer, he is a tragedy. Not long after taking office, he caught up with the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that you have a high position and weight, but you have to worry about money every day, and it is difficult to sleep peacefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why didn't you report to me in advance?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had been notified of such important information in advance, he would have taken countermeasures long ago, and would never let the situation develop to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is room for change until the taxes are collected. Now looking at the pile of bonds in the treasury, he is very worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the year, the loan interest will be paid. The creditors outside only recognize gold coins, but they will not accept a bunch of bonds as interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the interest payment cannot be carried out normally and the reputation of the Alpha Kingdom is ruined, then it will be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one answered, but it can be seen from the eyes that everyone kept scanning Crown Prince Caesar's body that it probably has something to do with his precious son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Caesar, as the supervisor, shouldn't you give me an explanation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said rather disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whatever the reason, messing things up is political stain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a reasonable explanation cannot be given, the future path of Crown Prince Caesar will become more and more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, you were unconscious at the time, and I didn't dare to disturb your recuperation with these troublesome things, so... so I dealt with it on my own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to let everyone focus on the overall situation, I wrote a personal letter to each of the great nobles in the kingdom, stating the pros and cons in detail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought they would save face, but I didn't expect each of them to go too far. They obviously didn't take my royal family seriously! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One by one, they promised him in private that everything will be done with the overall situation in mind. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, a bunch of bonds were sent up to offset taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The feeling of being fooled by his subordinates is really infuriating. If it weren't for the fact that he hasn't taken the position yet, he would have to take revenge one by one!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't care how wronged you are, this kind of thing happened now, it's your dereliction of duty as a supervisor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Little Caesar, you are no longer a child, how can you believe what others say so easily?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go back and carefully read their reply letter. Who has guaranteed you in the letter that they will not use war bonds to offset taxes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    will focus on the overall situation, that is just a cliché to deal with you. What is really needed is to see what they do, not what they say!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, it's useless to say these now. It just so happens that your big wedding day is not far away, so I simply invited them to the capital for a talk on the grounds of holding a wedding. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said after sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My son's filial piety is filial piety, but he obviously lacks political experience. If there is no problem with his health, he can train his son for another ten or eight years, and he will definitely exceed the average level of the monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that his health is not as good as before, and he doesn't have so much time at all. Let Crown Prince Caesar learn gradually, and the matter may not be so easy to solve. What happened this time was so sudden that even the omens were vague in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not careful, you will be ignored. The traces of human manipulation behind the scenes are too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden attack at such a time, most likely came prepared. Even if people are called, they may not buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, according to the kingdom's decree, the taxes were successfully transported to the capital and handed over to the treasury, and they fulfilled their obligations. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, reminded solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful Caesar III is, facing the nobles of the kingdom, it is also the relationship between major shareholders and small and medium shareholders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything must be tossed within the scope of the rules. Whoever crosses the line will need to bear the backlash from the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that they have fulfilled their obligations for this year, if the great nobles of the kingdom do not agree, Caesar III will not be able to do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Relax, Prime Minister. I know what they want!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No great aristocrat is willing to see the kingdom collapse. The plan of the Warcraft Legion has only just begun to be implemented, and it is self-evident what they want to do with such a big commotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculate the numbers. The war bonds they used to offset taxes this time are exactly the same as our annual military budget. Do you think there is such a coincidence in the world? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III mocked disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't see the naked hint, then you don't have to play politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But being able to see it doesn't mean being able to say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As King Caesar III, it doesn't matter to say a few words of sarcasm. If another person speaks nonsense here, once it spreads, he will immediately feel what the iron fist of a great nobleman is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if they really came after the cubs, do we have to compromise?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero asked unwillingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone wants to increase their strength. According to the previous agreement, the Warcraft cubs bred by the Alpha Kingdom will be divided equally between the Kingdom's military and the nobles participating in the cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that the nobles are no longer reconciled to this distribution ratio and want to obtain a higher quota when the cake is difficult to continue to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the threat of the orcs was gone, and in the eyes of the nobles, there was no need for the kingdom to maintain a strong standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the army has always been under the indirect control of the nobles, after the military gets these magical beast cubs, a considerable part of them will return to their clansmen who served in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power that can be controlled indirectly is ultimately inferior to direct control. Many nobles huddled together, and with everyone restraining each other, the army has always been firmly in the hands of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the king's control over the army was weakened in this war, Caesar III still had the heaviest voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That depends on their determination. If they are determined to weaken the military and strengthen their own military power, no one can stop them!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a trace of loneliness appeared on Caesar III's brow. It's not that he doesn't want to stay strong all the time, but his body doesn't allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that he can be strong when he is in power, because he has made great contributions to the kingdom and his prestige in the country is high enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Crown Prince Caesar is replaced, the situation will change fundamentally, and there will be a dispute at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps ten or twenty years later, Crown Prince Caesar, who is politically mature, will be able to try to wrestle with all the great nobles in the country, but it is obviously far away now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long period of time to come, the political pattern of \"declining kingship and growing aristocracy\" has almost taken shape, and Caesar III can't do anything about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with his good foundation, the power of the royal family is growing rapidly. Even if the royal power declines, it will not decline too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the political wisdom of Crown Prince Caesar matures, the discourse power lost in the early stage can be slowly regained later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of power game will happen every time the dynasty changes. Caesar III has seen too many ups and downs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He thought he could face it calmly, but he didn't expect it to happen to him, and he was still not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city gate caught fire, which affected the fish in the pond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also experiencing an economic crisis, the situation in the Principality of Moxi is obviously much more severe. It's not that the nobles of the Moxi Principality are more infighting, the main reason is that they lost too much in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The large piece of land to the north of the royal capital was almost turned into white ground. There are very few noble fortresses that have survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major provinces to the south of the capital were also seriously injured. It can almost be said that every family wears mourning and everyone weeps bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war not only impoverished the principality government, but even the pockets of the nobles were clean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The economy, which was already fragile, was so stimulated that it collapsed at a very fast speed. Everyone didn't even have the courage to die, so they just raised their hands and surrendered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the taxes collected, which are almost all war bonds, George's mood is full of flavors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"All the collected war bonds will be destroyed. Now everyone's life is hard, let's work together to tide over the difficulties!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare for such a caring king, but it is inevitable that George would not be caring. Gold coins accounted for less than 20% of the taxes in the first half of the year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After compromising once, it is much easier to compromise a second time. Doomed to borrow new to pay back the old, then simply borrow more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation seems to be a bit bad. Although the construction bonds we issued this time were also sold, the time it took was several times longer than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big nobles who were keen to buy bonds also stopped this time, and most of the buyers were small and medium nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, recently, the amount of privately traded bonds has also been increasing, as if someone is quietly shipping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only our bonds, but also the war bonds issued by the Alpha Kingdom frequently appear in major auctions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is: the transaction price is still firm, and there is no sign of a collapse yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they have already sensed the risk, but the amount of bonds held in their hands is too large to get out of it for a while, so they choose to continue to cooperate with us in issuing bonds to delay the crisis of the collapse. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but with the heart of the Minister of Finance, it is quite strange to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is necessary to coordinate the relationship with all parties to raise funds by issuing bonds to the outside world, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the main force in the work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a front-line management department, seeing the principality's ever-expanding debt figures, he almost couldn't sleep well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with the concept of borrowing new ones to return old ones, but the prerequisite for this kind of genius idea to be realized is that there are enough funds outside and they are willing to lend them a steady stream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the capital chain is broken and the routine can no longer be played, it will be the time of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We have no way out, if they notice a problem, we should borrow more before they finish shipping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they wait for them to complete the risk transfer, I am afraid that someone will not be able to help but pierce the bubble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they have gained enough benefits from it. Getting out at this time is undoubtedly the best choice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before choosing to embark on the path of \"borrowing the new to repay the old\", he was ready for the bursting of the bubble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are not fools. They know how to send people to collect information about the Principality of Moxi, so as to estimate their financial income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a certain error in this figure, government operations still have costs. When the fiscal revenue is lower than the interest expense, anyone can easily draw the conclusion that the fiscal is about to go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the uncle who owes a lot. Even if they realize that there is a financial problem in the Principality of Moxi, the creditors dare not come to collect the money in advance, lest they accidentally detonate this huge debt mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to protect their own interests, they had no choice but to build momentum for the new bonds of the Principality of Moxi, and to take advantage of them to delay the debt storm; on the other hand, they sold the bonds in private to pass on the crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if we continue to borrow like this, our debt burden will only become heavier and heavier, and the consequences of bankruptcy will become more terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to take advantage of the fact that our debts have not yet exploded, communicate with a group of creditors in advance, and try our best to persuade them to reduce the bond interest to ensure that they can be paid normally. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said with trepidation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was really scared. As long as I think of the scene of being chased and killed by all the creditors after the debt thunderstorm, I can't help but feel my scalp tingle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him the prime minister of the Principality of Moxi?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes time to use force to collect debts, if the creditors don't chop him off, who else can they chop him off?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't go after King George!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing the king is the number one taboo on the continent of Aslante. Even if George stood in front of the creditors, no one dared to shoot him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, at least we can't do this until they sell the bonds in their hands!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a debt default. Money owed to a group of big nobles and money owed to a group of small and medium nobles are two completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just do as I said, increase the number of bond issuances, and get cash back as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    and other major forces have withdrawn from the debt crisis, and we will decide whether to have a showdown! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said with a serious expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to escape smoothly, he could only carry out this silent transaction. If you don't feed the major forces involved first, it will be a matter of minutes to arm and collect debts later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It cannot be said that following around the clock, Hudson was by her side at least a third of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The longer we spend together, the deeper our understanding will be. Hudson's changes can't be hidden from her, the pillow person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nothing, it's just that there have been a lot of things happening recently. But it's all making noise outside, and it doesn't have much impact on us!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson continued to explain: \"Many people used bonds to offset the autumn tax collected by the Kingdom of Frontline Days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War bonds are said to pay three times as much in taxes as cash. In addition to maintaining the daily operations of the kingdom, a large part of these taxes is used to pay interest on bond funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that this kind of thing has happened, next year's kingdom's budget may be tight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just today, I received the invitation letter of the crown prince's wedding. Two things collided by coincidence, and I'm afraid something big will happen next! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the explanation, Melissa said thoughtfully: \"Hudson, I understand. The large-scale use of war bonds to offset taxes is obviously the intention of the great nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What you are worried about now is not the upcoming political turmoil; it is that the great nobles in the kingdom are colluding with each other in private to make troubles, but no one has been sent to inform you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is indeed very troublesome. However, I once heard my father say that every great nobleman will be suppressed by vested interest groups when he rises up. Only by withstanding this test can he truly gain a foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, your journey is really smooth. But in just five or six years, he went from a little knight to his current position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, everyone does not allow alternative existence. It's a miracle that you climbed so fast and didn't get suppressed by all the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this has something to do with your ability to be a human being. Enough favors have been sold before, so that everyone is embarrassed to take action against you. Coupled with the existence of the Warcraft Incubation Base, we have established common interests with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at most, this will allow everyone to let you join the game circle, but it doesn't mean that you are one of your own. If you want to get everyone's approval, unless you stand in line with the banner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that you don't want to be on this team right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The methods of His Majesty the King today are too harsh, and the alliance of great nobles with their own minds may not be able to win in the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the king is powerful, but His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is very ordinary. Kingship may have the upper hand now, but in the next few decades, the situation will most likely be reversed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't join the noble camp now, you are afraid that you will be marginalized when the situation changes in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This political marginalization will directly affect the subsequent competition between the Koslow family and the Dalton family for the supremacy of the southeastern province. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa's words shocked Hudson. When did my wife become so powerful? Didn't she meet a character like Wu Zetian?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why are you looking at me like that?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't this obvious, is my analysis wrong?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the family classics, similar cases have been recorded. Although the speed of the protagonist's rise is not as fast as yours, it is not much slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After rising, he was jointly suppressed by a group of great nobles, and finally died of indignation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an ancestor who made detailed notes at the back of the story and gave a solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specific operation: Basically, it is similar to what you are doing now. It is all about making friends, selling more favors, pulling everyone to build common interests, and finally integrating into the circle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't explain it, but Hudson is even more distressed if you explain it. I originally thought that my operation was very clever, but I didn't expect that someone would have thought of it long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Melissa can see it, other members of the Holliser family may also see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most precious thing about great nobles is the long inheritance. Among the countless predecessors, all kinds of great people may be born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe other families also have powerful ancestors who have made similar deduction. Even in the past history, there have been real cases of similar routines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson found that Aslante was too difficult to mix. Facing these great nobles with ancient inheritance, it is really too difficult to play routines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pits that can be stepped on, the ancestors have stepped on them for them. As long as you learn from the lessons of your predecessors, you won't be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This feeling didn't last long, and Hudson returned to normal. The only lesson humanity has learned from history is that it never learns any.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can learn lessons from it are all dragons and phoenixes. Most people are ordinary people, no matter how high their status is, their essence is still ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If only all the great nobles in power were so awesome. The continent of Aslante has long been unified by humans, and the human race will not be divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone has read a similar script, it might be a good thing for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how old the routine is, the story can be new. Applying past experience to deal with it will only lead to humiliation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Melissa. Today's conversation is very useful to me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You're right, when you don't know what to do, it's best not to do anything! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, Melissa was at a loss. My mind was full of thoughts: \"Did I just say these words?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, the bright sunshine filled the earth, and Hudson rushed to the Warcraft Incubation Base in high spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today is a good day, the fertile monster started to give birth, even though the eggs were born one by one, it didn't affect everyone's good mood at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the three mutated large griffin eggs in the bird's nest, Hudson understood the mood of the female griffin lying dead on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his intelligence is not high, he still has a memory as a monster. As a griffin with experience in procreation, she knows her own eggs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the previous clutch of more than a dozen eggs, look at the three oversized eggs that have changed colors. What is this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Griffin King sees this, he will definitely not spare her. Maybe he will be kicked out of the group of griffins, and he will be on the road of no return to wandering alone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The quality of these three eggs is very good. The hatched cubs are the worst level three monsters. If you are lucky, you may be able to go directly to level four, five or six.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the dragon blood is powerful. You must know that this female griffin on the ground is a second-order monster. Just one mating has greatly increased the potential of the offspring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I don't know what the hatched offspring will look like. This kind of hybrid has a very high probability of mutation. Even if it is born in the same litter, it is possible to give birth to three different monsters! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emotion of the old magician left Hudson speechless. If you want to talk about it, let's talk about it in detail. If you talk about half and leave half, you can easily be beaten by people when you walk at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he seemed to have seen the portrait of the old man once when he was in the Wangdu Library.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the few great magisters on the bright side of the Alpha Kingdom, he is only a step away from the legendary sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, let this old man go first. The only ones who have the strength to beat this old guy in the mountains are Hudson's dragon and bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this guy was beaten with a sap in the territory, the word murderer would be written on Hudson's forehead. At that time, his disciples and grandchildren will come to him, and it will not end well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Master Robert, we all know that different types of monsters tend to mutate, but how can we make them stabilize the same form and become the same species?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone expended so much energy, not to enrich the Warcraft population. All kinds of beast card mounts can't be used to form a legion at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purely relying on chance and luck, the cost and energy needed to be born into the same ethnic group is too huge, far beyond everyone's ability to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there is still magic in this world. It is entirely feasible to use extraordinary power to influence the direction of species variation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This matter is simple, you only need to put these three eggs into the special potion and infuse them for the same time, and the hatched monsters will be of the same race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is this kind of egg later, and the same operation can be taken. As long as the soaking time is the same, the hatched monsters are of the same race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are two sides to everything. Relying on magic potions changes the direction of the monster cubs' mutation, and it will also greatly weaken the growth potential of the cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naturally mutated sub-dragon monsters have at least a one-third chance of giving birth to monsters of level four or higher, but under the intervention of magic potions, all the cubs are level three monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the acquired artificial cultivation, the original wildness of Warcraft has been weakened, and the probability of breaking the blood limit in the future is also very low. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robert deliberately emphasized the tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that he supports allowing the cubs to mutate freely, but unfortunately, he doesn't count on this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the monster legions under the command of the major forces in the mainland, we know that the level of monsters equipped is generally not high, so we know the choices everyone made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a choice, everyone hopes that their monster mounts will be more powerful, but it is a pity that monsters above the fourth level have a certain amount of wisdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to play potion to ripen, I am afraid that I am forcing the Warcraft to rebel. This kind of potion with damage potential and longevity is no less than highly poisonous in the eyes of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no medicine that can ripen monsters without side effects. It's just that the required raw materials are almost extinct in the mainland, and the manufacturing process is even more cumbersome and terrifying, and it is impossible to mass-produce them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Master Robert proposed a different hatching plan, I think it's better to change the previous distribution plan for cubs and directly distribute monster eggs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific method of hatching is decided by each of them directly, so as to avoid further disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the female beast must unconditionally cooperate with the hatching, and the previous agreement will not be fulfilled until the hatching is completed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Raquel said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the representative of the Principality of Moxi, Raquel is a typical example of war changing destiny. After a great battle, he was successfully escorted to become the heir to the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts once again prove that the winner is not necessarily the strongest, but he must be able to survive to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the good cooperation with Hudson, this crucial task fell directly on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suggestion made at this moment is not because the Principality of Moxi wants to make troubles, but more because it does not want to cause another twists and turns in the plan of the Warcraft Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, the scene became lively. A group of representatives from various major forces immediately began to discuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people support it, and some people oppose it. But generally speaking, there are still more people who support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what method is used for distribution, as long as the previously agreed ratio remains unchanged, everyone's core interests will not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to decide your own destiny than to let others decide. Those who can come here are all the favored sons of the major forces, and there is inevitably a sense of pretentious arrogance in their bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the expressions of everyone eager to try, Hudson knew that someone had been limped by the old guy Robert.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do not use magic potions, let the eggs hatch naturally, it seems that there are infinite possibilities, but also endless risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is to improve the mount for the noble lord, it is natural that this kind of sub-dragon beast with greater potential is better. But if you want to form a monster army, then get rid of these thoughts as soon as possible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimated that these high-quality sub-dragon beasts, before they had time to grow up, other people's magic beast legions had already formed combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is knowing, Hudson still didn't mean to remind. It is estimated that many nobles present have similar ideas, and they can count as one if they can fool you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a certain idiot is killed, it just reduces one potential competitor. The competition among nobles has always been so unpretentious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you got off to a good start, in the following days, your pregnant females will start to give birth one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the output is significantly lower than before. Even a high-yielding monster like the Griffin can only have four eggs at most in one litter. If you are not lucky, you may only have one egg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, the Black Mountain Leopard actually laid eggs?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is rare and strange. Montenegro leopards are mammals, and their offspring have always been directly born leopards. This wave actually changed eggs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laying eggs is no big deal, dragons are hatched from eggs. In the case where the dragon gene is dominant, it is reasonable to change the reproduction attribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is that the black mountain leopard is a mammal, can she hatch eggs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A female leopard can't hatch eggs, and Maxim's scumbag dragon can't even hatch eggs. Parents can't incubate eggs, do you want to find some unlucky bird to be the catcher?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or directly work hard in magic technology, manually helping leopards hatch eggs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is definitely not an isolated case. In the next reproduction process, more mammalian monsters will lay eggs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, I have a group of partners, otherwise I would be dumbfounded in this special situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, my lord. The black mountain leopard's eggs have just been born, and they have attracted the attention of many magicians. Now they are doing research around those two eggs!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, those two special eggs also have a lot of attraction for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although he is also a mage on the surface, the moisture in it is too heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have a series of magical knowledge, the time to learn it is too short, and you haven't had time to master it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leopard laying eggs, no matter how rare it is, is not as important as the letter Hudson has in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The debt crisis of the Principality of Moxi was on the verge of breaking out. As an old friend, King George wrote to him to complain about his bitterness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no mention of money on the surface, but the information exposed between the lines is all caused by lack of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Writing to Hudson at this moment seems to be an exchange between old friends, but it is actually asking him for advice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea of ​​issuing bonds was indeed proposed by Hudson, but while making the proposal, he also deliberately reminded the Moxi people to pay attention to controlling the scale of debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately: Debt is full of magic. Once you embark on this road of no return, there is no possibility of turning back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war ended, Hudson paid close attention to the situation in the Principality of Moxi, waiting for their debts to explode at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to delay the debt crisis until now by tearing down the east wall and repairing the west wall is enough to prove that George is a qualified \"wall paster\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the opportunity of the participating nobles eager to get out, they played the game of borrowing new and returning old to the extreme, and Hudson had to say admiration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how much the debt crisis is delayed, the crisis always exists and cannot disappear out of thin air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the person coming, Hudson sighed and said: \"Viscount Raquel, I already understand what your king means. I don't have a perfect solution, but I do have a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how tight the finances are, it is definitely not advisable to directly declare renege on debts. As long as your country still wants to hang out on the mainland, these debts cannot be repaid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your country is currently incapable of paying cash directly, which does not mean that you are incapable of repaying debts in other ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: knowledge inheritance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things that can only be regarded as common sense among the big nobles, but for the lower nobles, they are treasures that can be encountered but not sought after.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is happening now is just right for you to play. A large amount of debt was transferred to the small and medium nobles, which created maneuverability for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of waiting for the debt to be thundered, creditors come to the door to collect debts, it is better to take the initiative to attack in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you figure out what the small and medium-sized nobles with large foreign debts need most now, you can prescribe the right medicine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, for things like knowledge, even if you copy a hundred or a thousand copies, the knowledge in your hands will still not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as you sign a confidentiality contract with the creditors in advance, this kind of business can continue in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, once this kind of transaction is leaked out, you will face big troubles, and I am afraid that you will offend many people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, Raquel was dumbfounded. This is not just an ordinary bad idea, it is simply an idea that can kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The class in the Aslante continent can be solidified, relying on the tacit understanding of the ruling class. Among them, everyone teamed up to block knowledge inheritance, which is the most important part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the monopoly of knowledge is broken, once an opportunity is encountered, the following small nobles may rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the probability of going upstream is very low, but there are so many little nobles! As long as the base is large enough, there will always be lucky ones who stand out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of new players will join, which will inevitably increase the competition of the upper ruling group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The consequences caused by this will not be a reshuffle of a certain region or a certain country, but a political reshuffle of the entire society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the instigator, he is bound to be hostile by the traditional ruling group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the consequences of doing this are too great. Once the news gets out, the Principality can't afford it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson nodded slightly, then shook his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are right, this matter is indeed very troublesome. But if the future troubles are minor, how can it be considered a bad idea?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The debts that your country owes one after another are at least tens of millions of gold coins, and they may exceed 100 million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a huge sum of money, if you don't pay the price, how can you pay it back in a short time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Repayment tax, you have tried to collect. It turns out that taxing repayments doesn't work in the face of huge debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The post-war reconstruction took up a lot of resources. Given the reality of the Principality of Moxi, it simply did not have the ability to repay its debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are only two choices you can make: either secretly pass on knowledge to pay off debts; or privately sell some special resources that can be mass-produced but are tacitly blocked by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what choice is made, it is a challenge to the existing order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my opinion, the best choice right now is to find a way to settle some creditors first, and then raise money to repay part of the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are some outrageous behaviors, as long as you do a good job of keeping secrets, it will be difficult for the outside world to know what you have done!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are afraid of being exposed, and the small and medium-sized nobles involved in the transaction are even more afraid of news leaking. At least until they rise, they will be kept strictly confidential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just relying on some rumors and rumors, I think your country can still survive the little turmoil caused by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is finally exposed, it will be many years later. It is estimated that when you recover your vitality, and with the support of the kingdom, you are not afraid of someone coming to point fingers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson explained so patiently, obviously not for volunteer work. As a new great aristocrat, the only way to achieve greater development is to break the current profit distribution pattern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the development history of the mountainous territory, one can know that they are either farming or opening up wasteland. Life is hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson doesn't want to develop rapidly, it's that the interests have already been divided up by everyone. No matter where it reaches out, it will be resisted by those with vested interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, when the development of the swampland is completed, the mountainous territory will reach the peak of development, and there will be no further hope in sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Subconsciously, Hudson is not willing to be ordinary. From the moment he encouraged the Principality of Moxi to issue bonds, he knew that something would happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the Mosi people choose to default on their debts or repay their debts by breaking the unspoken rules, it will eventually cause damage to the existing order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you have successfully persuaded me. Unfortunately, the final decision-making power is not in my hands. What the Principality will do next is still unknown for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, we will always remember your dedication to the Principality. If there is any need that we can do, just ask for it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said gratefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a polite word, but to really give something in return. As for the specific reward, it all depends on the next choice of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson's plan is adopted, compensation must be indispensable. In other words, it can also be called - hush money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no time to care about these side details. After sending Raquel away, Hudson was busy counting the accounts in the territory again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the end of the year, we have to do a work summary. The summary that was supposed to be done at the end of the year was dragged to April of the following year, together with the summary of the first quarter. The main reason was that I was too busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past year or so, many major events have taken place in the mountainous territory: the massive immigrant, the wedding of the lord, the establishment of the Warcraft breeding base...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, without counting the immigration expenses, the budget deficit last year was as high as 320,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The financial situation of the territory this year has not only failed to improve, but worsened further. In the first quarter alone, our fiscal deficit was as high as 130,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expenses of compensation for territory replacement and resettlement of immigrants are added, the total deficit of last year plus the first quarter of this year will be as high as two million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the land replacement compensation is a one-time payment. Now that the resettlement has been completed one after another, the subsequent expenses are mainly for infrastructure construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These expenses are not urgent, and can be gradually expanded in batches according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiscal deficit intensified in the first quarter of this year, mainly due to the rapid decline in the profits of the steel industry. Compared with the same period last year, the monthly income of 20,000 gold coins was less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second is the formation of the Warcraft Legion. According to the agreement reached with all parties, we have allocated thirty-six monster eggs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the lack of hatching means in the territory, we paid 1,500 gold coins for the hatching fee to the Magicians Association.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the training package given by the Mage Association, it is estimated that the next maintenance costs will cost at least 200 gold coins per month. (excluding labor and ripening agent costs)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that there are still a large number of female beasts who are pregnant, in the following days, we will receive varying amounts of Warcraft eggs or cubs every month, and the future expenses will further increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the most optimistic estimate, we are expected to harvest 300 Warcraft cubs this year, and the estimated new expenditure will be 30,000 to 50,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It depends on the development and use of the drug.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have, at present, the Kingdom Magician Association has only approved four special ripening potions for monsters, and one popular ripening potion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These research and development accounts are mostly improvements to existing ripening agents, and strive to minimize costs and side effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the major nobles of the kingdom have invested a lot, and all kinds of resources are tilted towards it. I believe that results will be produced soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thirty-six monster eggs we obtained belong to eight kinds of monsters, and there will only be more types of monsters added in the future. If you want to form a Warcraft Legion, you must make a choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that we have an agreement with major domestic nobles to share the research and development results of ripening potions for free, our best choice is to keep the Warcraft cubs approved by the Mage Association and sell all the remaining cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the monster legions of all parties are in the start-up stage, and it is the time when there is the greatest shortage of monsters. Selling the cubs at this moment will not worry about not getting a good price! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the financial officer of the territory, Rudolph was also worried about the territory. The Warcraft Legion has just started, and he is trying to sell the Warcraft to reduce expenses and return funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he made a fuss over a molehill, but the number of Warcraft cubs is increasing. This situation will continue until the end of Maxim's estrus period, then it will gradually decrease, and finally stabilize at a fixed value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This year, the military expenditure will increase by 30,000 to 50,000 gold coins, and next year this number may increase several times. After all, the use of ripening agents is inevitable if one wants to be enlisted in service as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to control the types of monsters from the beginning, unify the logistics supply standards, and reduce costs by large-scale breeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Sir Rudolph. Your lord still owes two hundred and fifty-six magical beast cubs outside, and most of the magical beast cubs this year will have to be used to pay off the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about the ripening potion, your master is a genius wizard. It may be difficult to research and develop independently. Is it possible to copy the formula and not make it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of the mountainous territory is high, and it is also a huge amount on paper. The compensation for the territory replacement was as high as 1.2 million gold coins, which sounded very scary, but in fact the cash paid was not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the newly-emerged great nobles, Hudson still has many resources that the small nobles covet, such as: Warcraft cubs, life essence...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Hudson not only owes a bunch of Warcraft cubs outside, but also owes a lot of life essence. He even promised ripening potions in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The compensation announced to the outside world is gold coins. When it comes to specific operations, everyone still chooses resources more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for taking out dozens of doses of life essence on the spot, the rest of the resources are foreign debts. Creditors can wait at ease, and Hudson is even more worry-free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going in and out of the laboratory every now and then is not completely fruitless. According to the plagiarism of the craftsmanship recorded in the formula, Hudson still produced a lot of magic potions like life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the promised life essence is fully fulfilled, it is not a big problem. However, in order to reduce the impact, Hudson deliberately used the excuse of collecting raw materials to delay the delivery time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, according to the unspoken rules of the kingdom, in order to stabilize the social order, all major forces are restricting the flow of life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a stable nobleman, it is no problem for Hudson to fool others into breaking the rules. It is definitely out of the question for him to be the leader himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that everyone is not in a hurry to use it right away. You can definitely delay the time and deliver it privately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some operations, the fiscal deficit of more than two million gold coins actually became more than one million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the money Hudson made in the last war, it accounted for a quarter of the total. With his current cash reserves on hand, he can completely continue to support the high deficit development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, if the military expenditure can be brought under control, then our Finance Department is confident that within two years, we can achieve a balance of income and expenditure in the territory!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past year or so, the Ministry of Government Affairs has also taken many measures to optimize the current management model and standardize the construction of grassroots teams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this reorganization, we removed seven incompetent officials, arrested three corrupt officials, and promoted thirteen officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three new management agencies were added, namely: Family Planning Department, Warcraft Management Department, and Pharmacist Management Department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, these three divisions are in the initial stage of preparation. Except for the appointment of the person in charge, the rest has yet to be implemented and is expected to be gradually improved in the next two to three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the relevant personnel appointment and removal documents, as well as the planning outline for the new organizational structure, please read it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Jacob handed over a document. The content is a total of two pages, which obviously implements Hudson's minimalist style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, all the announcement documents on the continent of Aslant have very little content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because the cost of parchment is too high, the content that can be finished in one sentence will never add a second sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cursory review, Hudson has no confidence at all in achieving a balance of payments within two years proposed by the Ministry of Government Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. According to the reported work progress, the artificial canal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and it is expected to be open to navigation in February next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the Grand Canal and an outlet to the sea, how can we not have our own shipyard?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This step has been taken, and that is the real spending of money. Last year's budget deficit was 320,000 gold coins, which also included the expenses of his lord's wedding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait until next year, when the voyage plan is released, it is estimated that the shipyard project alone will be able to squander this figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the ship expensive, but the magic circle depicted on the ship is even more expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

On the day of the crown prince's wedding, he can ride a giant dragon to attend the wedding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just for the sake of being in the group, in order not to steal the limelight from the groom, Hudson finally chose to go with the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the potential conflict of interests between the Koslow family and the Dalton family within the province, everyone still has to deliberately show their unity to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the two big bosses were running side by side in front, and the noble lords behind them were also divided into two waves tacitly, and the camps were quite distinct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This has caused a lot of neutrals, and it seems inappropriate to follow there. As a last resort, he could only choose to open a certain distance and hang behind the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was talking and laughing, but Earl Pierce was in a very bad mood. Leaving aside the difference in the quality of the younger brothers, the difference between the two sides is actually almost the same simply by counting the number of younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One family is a veteran aristocrat who has been in charge of the southeastern province for hundreds of years, and the other family is a new upstart who has not yet established a firm foothold. According to normal circumstances, the influence of both parties is not at the same level at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is very slap in the face. The high popularity of Dragon Knight has laid the foundation for the Koslow family to open up the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the advantages of a thriving population and marriages everywhere, the Koslow family managed to win over a group of supporters in a disadvantaged situation. Within the province, it has the foundation to stand up to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competitors with roots and competitors without roots are completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the noble council originally dominated by the Dalton family is now divided into two. Whether the proposal he initiated can be passed smoothly depends on how well the two parties win over the neutral faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, what a skill. The Koslow family can give birth to a hero like your Excellency. It seems that the rise is unstoppable!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Earl Pierce's sour temptation, Hudson just smiled slightly. The development speed of the Koslow family is indeed somewhat unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A year ago, there were very few nobles who dared to stand behind him openly; he never expected that after a series of marriages, his supporters would suddenly grow so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder nobles are keen on political marriages! Compared with other alliances, marriage is the fastest and cheapest way to form an alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the prosperity of the Koslow family is also the prosperity of the nobles in the southeastern province. If it is true, you are also responsible for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the provincial nobles unite as one, I think everyone will have a good chance of development and will soon become the strongest province in the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be honest, among the many provinces of the Alpha Kingdom, the Southeast Province is not the largest in area and the land is not the most fertile, but it is the most special one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A province with an area larger than the Southeast Province has less fertile land than the Southeast Province; a province with more fertile land than the Southeast Province has an area much smaller than the Southeast Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since a hundred years ago, the densely populated and fertile southeastern province has been the number one taxpayer in the Alpha Kingdom, and the number one kingdom with a solid comprehensive economic power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the military power develops again and becomes the most powerful province in the kingdom, it will be just around the corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competition between the Koslow family and the Dalton family also stimulated the improvement of the province's military strength to a certain extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Haha... Earl of Hudson is proud!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laughter covered up the embarrassment, and the original tense atmosphere suddenly dissipated invisible. Obviously, Earl Pierce was also very interested in Hudson's proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competition is competition. When common interests are encountered, those who should unite should still unite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bosses settled the deal, and the younger brothers who followed behind also relaxed. The three waves of people, who were originally distinct, merged in an instant, as if they had been rehearsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stepping into the capital again, the towering city walls are still tall and straight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the flags of the two major families fluttering in the wind, the officers guarding the city were very discerning and pulled the city gate full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The caravan pedestrians who were entering and leaving spontaneously gave way to the main road in the shortest time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is so natural, like flowing clouds and flowing water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, no nobles from several provinces crashed and arrived at the same time, otherwise, whoever enters this gate will cause another disturbance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officials who were expected to greet him did not appear. Obviously, the king was still angry about the fact that the southeastern province used war bonds to pay off its debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this is not Hudson's fault. The war bonds in his hands had been resold long ago, and now he only holds a small amount of them symbolically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Koslow family gave cash, which does not mean that the younger brothers under their command can also come up with all the cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a tacit agreement reached by all parties to allow small nobles with poor financial resources to use war bonds to offset taxes. The tax-paying Lord Hudson naturally accepted it readily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, he turned over more cash than bonds. It's a pity that he has integrity, which does not mean that other nobles also have integrity. In the end, the taxes paid by the southeastern provinces are still dominated by bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king is also a human being, and it is human nature to lose his temper appropriately to express his dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revisiting the old place, Hudson received a much higher salary this time. It's a pity that seeing Earl Pierce go to his own house, he can only envy him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family also has a house in the capital, but due to the geographical location and size, no matter how it is remodeled, it reveals a small family style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to live by yourself, but it's a little difficult to meet guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a real earl, Hudson is also a famous nobleman in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The house that fits his status level is also a scarce resource in the royal capital, and it cannot be bought with money alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson simply stayed in the post station, occupying the reception area of ​​the nobles alone, scaring all the post station staff into fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great nobles like to stay in their own territory, and rarely live in post stations when they arrive in the capital. In normal times, these VIP areas are basically unoccupied, and foreign visitors are occasionally received.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are full of inertia, and the frequency of use is low. In terms of maintenance, it is inevitable to be a little slack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that these concerns are purely unnecessary, Hudson has never been a picky person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a tiring day, they arrived at the capital and were dragged to a banquet. When they returned to the station, they collapsed on the bed and fell asleep. There was no time to pay attention to small details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, Caesar III dragged his tired body to welcome King George.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two countries attach great importance to this marriage, and have shown their utmost sincerity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar brought out the highest standard to greet his relatives. As a good brother, King George even chose to send his sister over in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, creating such a big scene is not just for the sake of marriage, but also to further deepen the alliance between the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the human nations in the Northern Continent, the Alpha Kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom, and the Moxie Principality are the three strongest. Even after experiencing the orc invasion, this pattern has not changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the Warhammer Kingdom has started the infinite internal fighting mode, the right to speak in many affairs of the Northern Continent has fallen into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the two countries, this should have been a good thing, but now everyone is out of shape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief continuation of the daily routine, Caesar III, the host, took the lead in opening up the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"George, the Orc Empire has fallen, but the situation in the northern continent is still not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, we only had to worry about the threat of orcs, but now we not only have to consider the alien race, but also face the open and dark arrows within the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the time being, let's not talk about the great powers such as the Kingdom of Franks, the Kingdom of Iberia, and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Dante, the Kingdom of Hesse, and the Kingdom of the South Bank in the middle of the mainland alone are no small trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that our two families were seriously injured, they couldn't bear it any longer and extended their tentacles to the North Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is just a trial at the moment, since the ambition is revealed, it is difficult to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a plan to jointly build the Warcraft Legion, it can only temporarily stabilize the countries of the Northern Continent. If our two families can't come up with strong measures for a long time, the choices of these fools will probably still be disappointing! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adversity may not necessarily reveal true friendship, but adversity can create allies. The common enemy has prompted the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi to stand together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right, the tentacles of the three central kingdoms are indeed too long. If you don't give them a warning, everyone may forget who is the master of the Northern Continent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Principality of Moxi was injured in the war. Even if I want to teach them a lesson, I can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But your country is different. His Majesty has worked hard for decades and accumulated a solid foundation for the Alpha Kingdom. In a few years, he will be able to heal the wounds of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the next actions, we are willing to stay consistent with your country and jointly maintain the prosperity and stability of the North Continent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said deliberately flatteringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving the initiative directly is not a question of whether to be counseled or not. It is mainly the regional hegemony of the Northern Continent, which is completely meaningless to the Principality of Moxi, which is deeply in debt crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, a region can only have one Overlord. For the Principality of Moxi, which has never been a hegemon, it is difficult to develop such ambitions when its vitality is severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to form an alliance with the Alpha Kingdom at this moment is more for self-protection than delusional forging ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's George. Even the current Caesar III doesn't have a strong will to forge ahead, and more is to defend the existing basic market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's still Grand Duke George who sees the problem thoroughly. If it weren't for the invasion of orcs, how could the current Northern Continent tolerate their arrogance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at a time like this, we should be steady and not rush.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three of them want to make a fuss, so let them make a fuss, for fear that they have the ability to start a fire but not the ability to put it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As we get through these difficult times, we have plenty of opportunities to settle with them. No matter how much they eat now, they will have to spit it out twice as much! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said domineeringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cough, cough, cough...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The untimely cough completely destroyed the atmosphere created by Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George, who was originally confident in the Alpha Kingdom, was also drumming deep in his heart at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the Alpha Kingdom is multifaceted, and one of the important factors is the rule of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he went to meet the Lord of Dawn and replaced him with a mediocre Lord, it would be a different situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, take care of yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a day or two since the two countries formed an alliance. At this time, the marriage has already started, and it is too late to go back on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he can only hope that Caesar III will live a few more years, support the alliance between the two countries, and stabilize the current situation in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I know my physical condition, and I will definitely not die in a while. Let's talk about business first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the current severe international situation, we also have a new trouble—the debt crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not very clear about the situation in your country. Anyway, the situation in the Alpha Kingdom is very bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those restless nobles, out of self-interest, actually negotiated terms with the kingdom at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be afraid of the Grand Duke's jokes. In view of the current complicated situation, there is a high probability that the Kingdom's Warcraft Legion plan will be downsized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with it depends on the result of the next negotiation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These seemingly sincere words fell into George's ears, and they became full of depression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he even had time to cry and sell miserably, he blocked the way for him to borrow money in advance, so what should he do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it was not thick-skinned enough, after a little hesitation, Grand Duke George bit the bullet and comforted: \"Your Majesty, don't worry too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every family has a few uneasy nobles. Your country's finances are not optimistic, and our situation is even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This year's tax revenue is almost all war bonds printed in previous years, and even if the treasury is empty, it can run away mice. I can't even pay officials' salaries on time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stay hard! As long as you persevere, you will eventually be able to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more he talked about George, the more he felt that something was wrong. It seemed that the financial problems of the Principality of Moxi were even more serious. How could he be comforting others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that he had been fooled, George secretly greeted Caesar III in his heart. However, on the surface, the two still had a happy conversation, but there was always something wrong with the atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing that there was a problem with the conversation between his father and brother-in-law, Crown Prince Caesar, who was acting as an accompanying guest, took the opportunity to say: \"It's time for the banquet to start.

The whole wedding is just two words—grand!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a melon eater, Hudson feels like a bumpkin. I thought that my wedding standard was high enough, and it was completely incomparable with the wedding of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's magician group is serving the wedding, creating a beautiful fairy tale world with pure natural and artificial magic methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immersed in it, Hudson barely distinguishes between reality and magic. It can be said with certainty that this grand wedding will definitely cause a sensation in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Hudson would not have known that magic could still be used like this. Sure enough, there is nothing impossible but unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other human nations are constantly developing and progressing, and the Alpha Kingdom is not idle either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps limited by capital investment, it is indeed behind in some aspects, but there are also some aspects that have reached the forefront of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the driving force behind human technological progress. How could the Alpha Kingdom, which has been under high pressure for a long time, stand still?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a beautiful fairy tale world, but once it is slightly modified, it can become a life harvester.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the astonished eyes of all the guests, it can be seen that this grand wedding has come to a successful conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III's move is not only to deter the countries in the mainland, but also a silent warning to the nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I'm afraid something big will happen in Wangduzhong. As one of the representatives of the military, what are you going to do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of Earl Oran rang in his ears, pulling Hudson back from his contemplation. Having commanded the national army once, Hudson was directly included in the military camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with him. Apart from being able to get involved with the army, he basically has little say in politics. If you want to rely on the civil service system, there is no place for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is a bit complicated, and I am also in a dilemma now. Your Majesty summoned us this time, mainly for tax purposes, but it is actually a game between the great nobles and the royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The focus of the contradiction is on the distribution of Warcraft cubs. As a representative of the military, I naturally hope to give priority to meeting the needs of the Warcraft Legion; but as a member of the great nobles, I...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alas, trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** decides the head, and the current Holliser family is a member of the great aristocratic group. Although they are at the bottom of the list, the interests of the family still determine their position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is an ally, when it comes to specific interests, Hudson does not dare to expect that everyone will always have the same position. Proper retention is good for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When you step into this circle, you can't help yourself. Hudson, with your status and status, this incident is destined to be inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sooner or later, you have to express your position. Instead of being forced to express your position, it is better to take the initiative now and take the opportunity to gain some benefits! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't say it clearly, Hudson still understood what Earl Oran meant. It was nothing more than trying to pull him into his own faction to increase the Holliser family's voice in the faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no rush to stand in line, but Hudson still knows the political faction relations within the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the second family of the former southeastern province, the Holliser family has always been the target of suppression. In order to fight against the Dalton family, they had to surrender to the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the rise of Hudson, the Koslow family replaced the original responsibilities of the Holliser family and became a new force to check and balance the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a successor, the Holliser family has the opportunity to jump out of the southeastern province. Going north to develop is not only the Earl of Oran's own choice, but also the king's choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the strong support of Caesar III, the Holliser family, who performed mediocrely in the war, would not be so simple to stand out from many competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, in addition to defecting to the king politically, the Holliser family also maintains a close relationship with many big nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Holliser family, but also many nobles in the kingdom, it is difficult to divide political factions with a unified standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is common for a noble to belong to several camps at the same time, or maintain close relations with multiple political factions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The operation that everyone is most accustomed to is to stand with this group of people on this issue; and to stand with another group of people on another issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that apart from the relatively fixed political groups of the northern nobles, the other political factions in the kingdom are often you have me, and I have you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the big aristocratic camp that is now playing games with the king, it is essentially just a competition for interests caused by the distribution of Warcraft cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the immediate interests, everyone formed a temporary alliance. When the interest demands are met, or if they fail in the political game, the temporary alliance will be disbanded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, although the internal struggles of the Alpha Kingdom are fierce, compared with other countries on the mainland, the factions are distinct, and the overall situation is relatively moderate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Count Oran. The current situation is indeed complicated, but the ending has been doomed from the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the threat of the orc empire, a group of nobles in the kingdom are no longer willing to continue to provide high military expenditures. The distribution of the Warcraft cubs this time is just the fuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no such thing, there will be other things that cause disputes. Under the general trend, no one can stop the kingdom's trend of reducing military expenditures! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political issues never exist in isolation. Things that seem simple and clear are often linked together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't come to the capital this time and had contact with many military generals, Hudson couldn't guarantee that he could figure out the relationship behind him in such a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the \"reduction in military spending\", Earl Oran frowned. Since the end of the war, the kingdom has continued to disarm and reduce military expenditures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, affected by the Warcraft Legion plan, the kingdom's military budget this year still exceeds that before the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the multi-ethnic countries on the continent of Aslante, the proportion of military expenditure of the Alpha Kingdom has always been at the highest level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In most of the time, the military budget accounts for more than 70% of the financial budget, and occasionally there will be more than 90% of the extreme situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are threats from foreign enemies and high military expenditures, so everyone will naturally have no objections. But now that the foreign enemy has disappeared, the situation has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you mean the king will compromise?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran said with a flustered expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A powerful standing army is not only a powerful means for the Alpha Kingdom to deter foreign enemies, but also an effective measure for the Kingdom to suppress internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of which noble family or political group, the military strength they possess is far inferior to the kingdom's standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this powerful standing army, the kingdom can effectively maintain the rules of the game and limit internal struggles within the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the military budget is greatly reduced, the strength of the standing army will inevitably be greatly damaged, and the authority of the central government will also be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Holliser family who just moved their base camp to the Northland, this is by no means a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no central government to suppress the nobles of the North, none of them, who have yet to gain a firm foothold, will have a good life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't you already have the answer in your heart?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"However, His Majesty's methods should not be underestimated. Even if he agrees to cut military expenditures, it is impossible without conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If my judgment is correct, then the power of the royal family will usher in a period of rapid expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open the map of the kingdom and you will know that among the thirty-two provinces, the royal family occupies two provinces in the middle and three provinces in the north. The sum of the directly subordinate princes of the royal family distributed in other provinces can almost equal a province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the three northern provinces, the remaining areas are economically developed areas with densely populated areas. In terms of overall strength, even the nobles of the North would not dare to say that they surpassed the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the development of the three northern provinces is completed, the advantages of the royal family will become more and more obvious. You must know that apart from the royal family, there is no noble family in the kingdom that can monopolize a province!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For His Majesty, there is absolutely no need to confront everyone now, as long as you develop the royal family step by step!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Oran may not be unable to see these problems. It's just that the Holliser family is deeply involved in the situation, and there are too many interests involved to analyze the problem objectively and fairly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson didn't want to be troublesome, but the Holliser family was his in-laws and the only allies among the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the Earl of Oran fails to solve the puzzle in time and is pulled into the vortex of the storm, the Koslow family will also be dragged into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Four, the opportunity we have been waiting for is finally here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it turns out, the silence ahead of us was correct. Without us putting pressure on them, the **** would be infighting themselves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Torsten said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the last five Dukes committed suicide, the northern aristocratic group has suffered a series of suppression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only lost the qualification to distribute the spoils, but even the officials in the court who belonged to the noble camp of the Northland were driven home one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire northern noble camp was in turmoil, and was even on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the complex situation, the new five dukes, who were appointed in danger, made a decision after many deliberations: strategic contraction. Tolerance externally and politically, internally stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This tolerance lasted for a year and a half. During this period, the Northland Noble Group was a good boy who couldn't fight back when they were scolded or beaten. No matter how the enemy provokes, they have no intention of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, before the enemy could make a move, they sold off the property outside and completely retracted their tentacles back into the territory. So that all parties do not know how to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a lot of tossing, seeing that they had obtained all the advantages they could take advantage of, everyone shifted their attention and stopped staring at them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's still a bit too early to say this. Although they had disputes with Caesar III because of the Warcraft Legion, these conflicts did not break out after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, all parties still exercise restraint. Our Majesty the King used the pretext of the crown prince's wedding to call everyone here instead of directly talking about taxes, just to leave enough room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, at most, they will divide their relationship. If you want to intensify the conflicts between the parties, you need a fuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more this is the case, the more we must keep calm. Any drastic move may draw the attention of all parties back to us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cold water poured by Duke Rodriguez directly extinguished everyone's enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a lot of effort to get everyone to look away from them. If they were accidentally drawn back, it would be a big loss!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being stared at by the king and a group of great nobles every day, although it may not be possible to do anything to them, it can definitely make them unable to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Actually, it's not impossible to break the situation, but it's not now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the era of Caesar III, and it was all planned by him to get us into the current situation. It is almost impossible for him to overturn the previous decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But our good king is not in good health. According to the information obtained by Anzi, in the past year, Caesar III fainted three times and coughed and bled seventy-eight times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you look at it, it doesn't look like the Lord of Longevity. Maybe this year, maybe next year, in short, the era belonging to Caesar III is coming to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to His Majesty the King who wished to get rid of us quickly, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince's attitude towards us is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time he rescued the Principality of Moxi, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince accidentally lost tens of thousands of kingdom troops, directly offending the nobles in the southeastern provinces to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are in need of supporters. If we secretly contact him, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince should not refuse our kindness. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship between the royal family and the nobles of the North is certainly tense, but this does not mean that the two parties have no contact in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of the congeniality, the relationship between Hiero and Crown Prince Caesar has always been very good. Even if they belonged to different camps, it didn't affect the two of them becoming friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Proposing to join forces at this time is obviously discussed in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hero, you should know the king's attitude towards us. Once he finds out that we are in contact with His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, who knows what will happen next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of factors left over from history, the reputation of our five families in the kingdom has always been very bad. If His Majesty the King wants to take action against us, there will definitely be many people who will make trouble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Angel on the side said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not selfishness, it is entirely because the ancestors offended too many people. In their generation, if they want to repair the relationship with all parties, they don't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Angel! The king's side is not a problem, and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince will naturally have a way to deal with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a mature politician, His Majesty the King only has interests in his eyes, and hatred has never been a problem!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the royal family's homeland has been taken back, and the hatred between us and the royal family is no longer as deep as it used to be. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hiro said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's not normal to be so enthusiastic now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being courteous to others, one must ask for something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the simple greetings, Hudson immediately realized that something was wrong. The performance of Crown Prince Caesar was too eager.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was as if a big event had happened and supporters were urgently needed. Even nobles like him, who had had language conflicts, became the target of wooing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the only son of the king, he also serves as the bond of marriage with the Principality of Moxi. The status of Crown Prince Caesar can be said to be almost unbreakable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one explanation for being so eager now—Caesar III will die soon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing for successive new kings to take office is to stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an important figure in the military and the fourth dragon knight in the mainland, as long as Crown Prince Caesar is not stupid, he will definitely win over Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the overall stability of the kingdom, the little conflict that occurred in the Principality of Moxi is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Followed into the hall, after greeting the first few nobles, Hudson took his seat and waited quietly for the meeting to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three hundred and twenty-six years have passed since the ancestors founded the Alpha Kingdom, all the way to the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is called here today, mainly to discuss the future development of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire has declined, and the international situation has undergone earth-shaking changes. The kingdom's previous national policy is no longer suitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter not only involves the future of the kingdom, but also the future of your families. If you have any suggestions, please speak up! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hero is late. Looking at the trembling Caesar III, everyone couldn't help feeling sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of everyone's position, in everyone's mind, Caesar III is a qualified king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, although the international situation has stabilized, it does not mean that the crisis is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the kingdom's vitality was seriously injured, the three major kingdoms in the central region made more and more small moves, and their tentacles continued to extend to the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The civil war broke out in the Warhammer Kingdom, and it was very difficult to suppress the group of ancient survivors in the ice and snow world, not to mention the group of elves in the Norwegian forest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the situation gets out of control, the entire northern continent will fall into chaos. As the strongest country in the north, we are obliged to maintain the stability of the regional situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the year 99991 of the sacred calendar, and the next ten thousand years of catastrophe is close at hand. How restrained everyone is now, how violent it will be when it erupts in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the kingdom must have a strong standing army in order to be invincible in the changing situation in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Grand Duke Afiero turned his attention to Hudson. Among the feudal nobles, Hudson, who had served as the commander-in-chief of the army, had the closest connection with the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, this kind of position was usually held by the nobles of the royal capital or members of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who came to power by chance, has been labeled as the spokesperson of the military since he took the position of coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency is right, the current situation, the Kingdom is indeed not suitable for excessive reduction of armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mainland seems to be calm, but in the dark, the arms race has already kicked off a few years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the orcs, the kingdom has fallen behind in many fields in a new round of military technological change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to catch up now, it is not something we can do with our efforts. We must unite and cooperate sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I propose to set up a special research and development fund for the research and development of magic crossbows, magic crystal cannons, magic devices, monster breeding, and various magic potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the source of funds, I personally suggest extracting part of the tithe. If the amount is insufficient, taxes on luxury goods such as spices and tea can be levied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation, I think the investment in these projects should not be less than three million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the kingdom has no war pressure. The number of the standing army can be reduced, but considering the actual situation, it is not appropriate to do it in one step before the formation of the Warcraft Legion is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current standing army of the kingdom has dropped to 260,000, which is relatively reasonable. Even if you want to continue to reduce, there is not much room for compression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made us the third kingdom on the mainland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number of the standing army is too small to deter those wolves, tigers and leopards, wouldn't it be that cats and dogs will bully you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's voice immediately caused an uproar among the fief lords. One's own interests must be safeguarded, and the interests of the kingdom cannot be ignored either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the big circle of aristocrats, you still have to have a card. The same is true for nobles. When a noble from a strong country goes out, he speaks harder than the nobles from a weak country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for some large families engaged in international trade, they need a powerful kingdom to back them up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alliance is temporary, but interests are eternal. It seems that Hudson just said some unnutritious truths, but it is actually a split in the noble camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Great Noble Alliance, which was temporarily established due to interests, instantly split into two factions. Several great nobles engaged in international trade, forced by their own interests, have become hesitant at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, everyone understands the truth. If conditions permit, even if the kingdom forms a standing army of one million, we will support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the real problem is: no money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge debt has overwhelmed the kingdom. Continuing to maintain high military expenditures is bound to drag down our fragile finances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three consecutive years of war have exhausted the kingdom's strength. Now not only the kingdom is poor, but the people are even poorer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your southeastern provinces are rich and rich, and you cannot understand the suffering of our northern Xinjiang region. In order to complete the taxation task of the kingdom, nobles from all over the world are worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to support this war, several provinces in northern Xinjiang have reached the brink of collapse. If you don't expect to gain the support of the kingdom, you can't continue to increase our burden! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Torsten took the lead in firing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hatred is one aspect, and conflicting interests are the core factor. International trade has little to do with their group of landlubbers from northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the kingdom artificially opened a port in the north, it was only used for military purposes before. Although it was opened to the private sector after the war, maritime trade cannot be involved in a day or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long ago, they lost a large sum of money. In addition to the consumption during the war, the pockets of the five major families in the Northland were not rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In particular, the Kingdom has also canceled their military subsidies, and now they have to figure out their own way for every expense, but the north is not as rich as the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to get involved in ocean trade, they can only slow down and accumulate capital slowly. When it develops, I don't know what year and month it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the establishment of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms was an opportunity, but unfortunately there are several provinces further north in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who have just migrated here are all so poor that their eyes are red-eyed, how can they let them go and get a piece of the pie!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since I am not the beneficiary, why should I pay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Torsten, the Alpha Kingdom is a whole, and it is absolutely not allowed to form small groups in private and attempt to split the kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you faced the threat of orcs back then, how did everyone support you with all your strength? You won't forget it so quickly, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the northern border is safe, but this safety is also achieved through the joint efforts of the whole kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson counterattacked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson didn't want to do this kind of publicity, but someone gave too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson has obtained a lot of technical information through various secret transactions, sailors and boatmen are still a big problem for the Koslow family to set foot in the ocean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The obvious problems cannot be hidden from the wily Caesar III. Just last night, an uninvited guest suddenly came to the door and changed Hudson's mind, who was about to paddle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An offshore fleet, a large shipyard, and supporting sailors and shipbuilders are the price offered by Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these things are not free. All personnel and equipment have to be bought with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the era when capital prevailed, any commodity could be bought and sold. If you can't buy it, it must be that the bid is not high enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante dominated by nobles, the most important means of production have never been for sale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire Alpha Kingdom, there are very few families that own these things, and the royal family happens to be one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After weighing the pros and cons, Hudson chose to cooperate. As for the issue of the noble alliance, I haven't looked for him beforehand, so I don't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce hatred, Hudson pretended to be confused when he came up, never mentioning that everyone paid taxes on war bonds, and only started discussions around the military budget.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the spokesperson of the military, if he doesn't ask for an increase in the military budget, he is taking the overall situation into consideration. You can't expect him to propose a reduction in the standing army, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't talk nonsense! Our North...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Duke Thorsten could continue speaking, Duke Rodriguez hurriedly pulled him back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go on like this, you will really fall into the trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you do things like forming cliques in private, and it doesn't matter if others talk about it. If you publicly bring it up on the stage, it will really be a big hat that Hudson buckled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, it doesn't make any sense to mention the contributions of the nobles of the Northland. Who made them overturn at the last moment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone only remembers their fault of reselling military supplies. As for the previous meritorious service of defending the kingdom, it has long been wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that the situation was about to get out of control, Caesar III said, \"Okay, today's discussion is about the kingdom's future development outline, not a place to settle personal grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the political opinions are still controversial, then vote directly, there is no need to intensify the conflict. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that each of them is playing 50 big boards, but in fact they are more inclined, which can be seen from the gloomy face of Duke Torsten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If his companion hadn't caught him in time, he would have stepped on a huge thunder today. Not to mention that there will be no redemption, at the very least, he will be disgraced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for his own strength, he would have jumped out and challenged Hudson to a duel. It was so insidious that he didn't even forget to dig a hole for him even when discussing matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Duke Torsten, I am very sorry. I was too impulsive just now, please forgive my rudeness!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the episode of digging a hole just now, maybe everyone would really believe it. But aristocratic demeanor, that's what it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you want the other party to die in your heart, you have to hold it on your face. Especially in meetings of this level, it is necessary to be personable throughout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter, everyone is young. Now that His Majesty has spoken, let's vote according to the rules on the issue of military expenditure!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Thorsten, who had calmed down, responded with restrained anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Thorsten comforted himself: It doesn't matter if he fails in the bickering, the key still depends on the final voting result. He doesn't rely on lip service to make a living!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prince Torsten's suggestion is good, just go through the process, and this time it's okay for the two of us to jointly initiate the proposal.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what Duke Torsten thinks, Hudson is in a good mood now anyway. After being disturbed by him, the situation has already changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Families with a relatively large proportion of international trade, there is a high probability that they will rebound at this time, and the rest depends on the means of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king can buy him, and naturally he can also buy others. Hudson did not believe that Caesar III would pin all his hopes on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Push him out as the early bird because of his proper status. Even if there is no Hudson, there will be other fief nobles who will come forward. Anyway, it is impossible for Caesar III to end up arguing with everyone in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the two, seeing that Duke Torsten had no objection, the prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, slowly got up and said: \"The two representatives jointly initiated the proposal, and the content of the proposal is valid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is related to the future of the kingdom, please choose carefully. Still the old rules, there are three options: support, oppose, abstain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Voting now: Proposers of the nobles who support the Earl of Hudson's proposal, please raise your hands now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, Hudson raised his hand first. At this time, one cannot be modest. As one of the representatives of the meeting, his statement is also counted in the votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, more than 30 hands were raised in unison on the scene. Just looking at the number of supporters, the number of supporters has exceeded half, but unfortunately there is also a gap between hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One vote for a medium-sized nobleman is one vote, and one vote for a big nobleman starts with three, and Caesar III, who has the most, represents the right to speak of more than a dozen votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the counting of votes was about to end, Earl Pierce, who was hesitant at first, slowly raised his hand, and then several nobles from the frontier provinces followed suit and voted in favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how good the talks are in advance, it cannot meet the needs of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the orcs, the Alpha Kingdom, which is in a special position, has always had a good relationship with its neighbors. Even in the period of decline, no one reached out to the kingdom's sphere of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long time, everyone gradually forgot the threat of foreign enemies. Now being reminded by Hudson, these nobles with relevant interests have to think more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to fight for the cubs of the monsters. If the standing army is reduced too much, in case of international conflicts in the future, they can only rely on the private army support of the nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it with your toes, you know that the reinforcement speed of the standing army is definitely not comparable to that of the private army of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the central government happens to be in a weak period, the efficiency of this reinforcement will be even lower. Maybe just because of such a little efficiency, he will kill himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"With more than half of the votes in favor, Earl Hudson's proposal is approved!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reading the comments, I was sprayed so badly! Well, the author with few updates, dare not speak\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The huge debt is still the biggest problem plaguing the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, after the end of each invasion, the creditors will routinely announce that part of the kingdom's debts will be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the money, although it was still difficult to pay back, was still within the kingdom's financial ability to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the decline of the orc empire, this kind of good debt relief will naturally come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has ended for more than a year, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has communicated and negotiated with the creditors many times, but in the end it all ended without a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention reducing the principal of the debt, even the interest on the funds, that is not a penny less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Last year's autumn tax was a bond issued by the kingdom. Everyone sitting here should know better than me what the quality of this year's spring tax is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only two months left before the interest settlement time for the next batch of war bonds. Now the treasury is empty and the budget deficit is appalling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the kingdom's fiscal deficit this year will exceed 10 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether it is increasing income and reducing expenditure, or everyone subscribed for bonds mixed into tax payments, the problem must be solved today! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado's almost rascal words made everyone lose their temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has a huge financial deficit, and the biggest problem is that everyone uses war bonds to offset taxes. After solving this problem, although the deficit still exists, the numbers are within a controllable range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Use these methods together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows the financial situation of the kingdom. With our current fiscal revenue, at most, it is enough to pay interest on funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we keep procrastinating like this, what will we have to pay back when the bond redemption period is reached?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the run on tide breaks out and the kingdom's finances are overwhelmed by debts, everyone knows how serious the consequences will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it is necessary to formulate a reasonable repayment plan, recover the issued war bonds year by year, and reduce the total debt of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Zuel said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the oldest existence in the venue, the Marquis of Zuel most dislikes the irresponsible practice of only looking at the present and ignoring the future of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although before this, the Alam family also took a bunch of war bonds to offset taxes, but that was just a means to fight for their own interests, and it did not mean that he wanted to bankrupt the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom really goes bankrupt, all those with vested interests present will most likely have to pay a heavy price. Especially nobles whose nests are located in frontier provinces are the most vulnerable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong their own strength is, they are only a big noble family after all. Once out of the protection of the kingdom, there is a high probability that they will not be able to keep their existing interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The old Marquis is right. The debt problem must be resolved. I think we should set a repayment target from now on. This year, we will first repay the principal of 6 million gold coins, and then increase it year by year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The source of funds is also simple, first reduce expenditure, and you can count as much as you can reduce expenses. If the share is insufficient, the big deal is to imitate the Principality of Moxi and levy a repayment tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the war bonds that appear in the tax, they can be apportioned directly to the provinces for processing. Whoever collects the bonds will be responsible for digesting them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little nobles have weak families, so there is no way to use war bonds to deduct taxes. Could it be that we can't stand it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone will hold fewer banquets and engage in some fancy activities, and save money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have this awareness, you can go out now, the kingdom doesn't need irresponsible nobles! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's domineering words made Hudson slightly taken aback. It seemed that these proposals were all for the kingdom, but he always felt that they were aimed at his own family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, the Koslow family has been spending money like water. It is engaged in resettlement and relocation, and it is engaged in large-scale construction projects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the end of the war to the present, the total fiscal deficit of the mountainous area is as high as two million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As local snakes, the Dalton family planted a few spies in the mountain territory to obtain this almost public information, which is a matter of course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the hatching of the Warcraft cubs was completed, Hudson sent out more than 20 cubs one after another to offset the compensation for relocation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of self-destructive practice fell into the eyes of Earl Pierce, who mistakenly regarded it as a manifestation of lack of financial resources, which seemed reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in the eyes of veteran nobles, warcraft cubs are a strategic resource, no matter how many types there are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is not suitable for forming a Warcraft Legion, it can also be distributed to the clan members to cultivate individually to enhance the strength of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many members of the Koslow family, and the family alone is not enough. If it is not financially tight, how can it be outflowed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a competitor, since the other party is short of money, he must make up for it, making the other party even more short of money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that he has the opportunity to consume the financial resources of the Koslow family under the banner of righteousness, Earl Pierce has absolutely no reason to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Dalton family is a rich man. Not only does it occupy the most affluent land in the southeast province, but it also monopolizes the sale of salt and ocean trade in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding a little amortization is nothing to them. Even during the war, Hudson slapped him hard, but he still couldn't make this veteran nobleman really hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of golden egg attack, which does not distinguish between the enemy and the enemy, is not only affected by the mountain territories. It's okay for a veteran aristocrat with a solid family background to survive by cutting down on daily expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, for a group of emerging nobles who lack financial resources, apportioning an extra amount of debt repayment funds every year is a very terrible thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Hudson simply didn't bother to pay attention, and directly became a melon eater in his position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl Pierce, the suggestion to repay the debt in advance is indeed a good idea, but we must consider practical issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just went through a war, and the kingdom is in the recovery period. Especially the seven northern provinces who have just returned to the embrace of the kingdom, I am afraid they will not be able to share the cost! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Oran bit the bullet and retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As undeveloped land, taxation naturally does not exist. Normal taxes do not need to be borne, and taxes that are not equivalent to repaying debts do not need to be apportioned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no clear regulations on these temporary special taxes. However, according to past practice, there is a high probability that you will still have to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiefdom is in vain, and it is all supported by its old capital. No matter how deep the family background is, it must be frugal at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is done according to Earl Pierce's proposal, they will need to bear part of the amortization in the southeastern province, and they will still bear a corresponding share in the amortization in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After adding them all together, it is estimated that the Holliser family needs to bear more than the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is even more deceitful is that the money has to be spent every year, and there is a high probability that it will still increase every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large amount of funds have been withdrawn, and territorial development and immigration relocation work will definitely be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Oran, you are wrong to say that. For a long time, the kingdom has followed the principle of fairness, and the emphasis is on the equality of rights and obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you are sitting here, you must bear corresponding responsibilities. We are all complaining about suffering and tiredness, what about the people below?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's proposal just now is good. These debts will be repaid sooner or later, and they will eventually be repaid. By recovering part of the war bonds in advance, we can also save part of the interest on the funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really delayed for a few years, when the debt payment period comes, and everyone needs to raise nearly 100 million yuan at once, I am afraid that there is really no way! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Carles said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, a sneer appeared on the corner of Hudson's mouth. It seems that they are inseparable from righteousness, but in fact it is a means for established nobles to suppress emerging nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the proposal is approved, they can use legal means to take the opportunity to consume the financial resources of the emerging nobles and delay everyone's development progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happens in the middle of this, maybe the newly emerged nobles will be beaten back to their original forms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things are not uncommon in the continent of Aslante. More than half of the new great aristocrats will decline within a few decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the eager gazes of a group of emerging aristocrats, Hudson knew that at this time, it was time to stand out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has their own circle. Facing the suppression of the old nobles, a group of emerging nobles also secretly formed a group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this emerging political group is too loose inside, and it doesn't even count as an alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of veteran nobles, there are really not many people who dare to take the lead. The famous Hudson easily gained the right to speak in the small group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Carles, you are very right. The overall situation of the kingdom is very important to everyone here, but practical issues are equally important!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To formulate a policy, we must conduct an in-depth investigation first, and only after understanding the actual situation can we make the most reasonable decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You probably know what the newly recovered seven northern provinces are like. If you want to develop it, it can't be done overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting a group of aristocratic lords who can't make ends meet bear the debts of the kingdom, this is not an obligation, but their lives!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about raising money anyway, so why not do it another way?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of directly distributing according to the fiefdom, it is better to distribute it to the lucrative industry taxes such as salt, tea, spices, vehicles, entertainment, etc.! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson's voice fell, the veteran nobles frowned instantly. Allocating debt service funds to industry tax looks like taking money from businessmen, but in fact it is cutting their flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bustling commercial areas are all in the territory of the old nobles. Now that taxes are imposed on profiteering industries, they are also getting money from their territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you study carefully, you will find that behind almost all the profiteering industries, they are the veteran nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, it seems that you have missed some industries, such as: weapons and equipment, iron products, and trading of Warcraft cubs. The profits of these industries are also not low!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martinez said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the meat is cut on oneself will it feel pain. In his view, Hudson is simply standing and talking without back pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming the eyes of a group of veteran nobles who seemed to be smiling but not smiling, Hudson greeted him with a nonchalant smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Martinez's reminder is very necessary, but there are so many profiteering industries, it is too embarrassing for me to finish it in one breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about this, list all the profiteering industries that everyone thinks, and let's participate in the discussion together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is no need to mention outdated news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has just ended for more than a year, and everyone has a large backlog of weapons, and there is no market for them in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, it seems that the current iron products market is also in a depression. It is estimated that most practitioners are persisting at a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the trade of Warcraft cubs, Earl Martinez thinks there are huge profits in it, so let's list it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, judging from the current situation, it seems that it is very difficult for the kingdom to encounter several trades of Warcraft cubs a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone sold it, it was at an auction. Instead of looking for it all over the world, it is more convenient and quicker to directly increase the tax on the auction house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, don't you want to set up a Warcraft breeding base and tax the major forces in the Northern Continent participating in the cooperation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Count Martinez can convince everyone to agree, I have no problem at all. But if you get into trouble, it's best not to implicate the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he dared to raise taxes on profiteering industries, Hudson naturally made a plan. Although the current mountainous areas are not poor and white, there are still no profiteering industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to do arms trading, and the breeding industry of Warcraft cubs has involved many powerful forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Alpha Kingdom at its peak was unable to collect taxes from so many powerful forces, let alone now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't collect taxes without discrimination, don't expect Master Hudson to pay taxes alone. At worst, the cubs of magical beasts would appear suddenly and die suddenly, and some lucky nobles happened to pick up the cubs of magical beasts on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, don't be so nervous. I'm just a small suggestion. If you really decide to levy the levy on the cubs of magical beasts, you can only be responsible for the contract!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the sake of the kingdom, I think you can consider giving it a try. If the negotiation is successful, the Kingdom may be able to increase its income by hundreds of thousands of gold coins every year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it beautifully, but in his heart, Earl Martinez secretly complained: Hudson is tough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly simple dialogue is actually full of pitfalls. If you accidentally step on it, it will be difficult to climb out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wasn't vigilant enough and didn't follow Hudson's words to refute, he might end up in a mess now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of a mentality of revenge, he also planted a mine for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, if Hudson is really greedy and wants to contract the Warcraft cub tax, there must be no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the tax amount is not too high, the major forces are willing to pay a sum of money to buy out the favors they owed before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the nobles, debts of favor are far more meaningful than gold coins. It doesn't matter if it is not useful at ordinary times, once it is used, it can save lives!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Martinez's proposal is very good, but unfortunately, my ability is limited and I cannot undertake this important task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone has the ability to complete it, please stand up and take on this burden, I will definitely cooperate with all my strength! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson looked at everyone expectantly, as if he wanted to find a fool to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone is very rational and has no interest in this kind of behavior of snatching food from the mouth of a tiger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the levy of industry tax seems good, but when it comes to the specific implementation stage, there are a lot of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most areas of the kingdom implement a tax package system, blindly increasing the collection target, and no one can guarantee that it will be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, high taxes will also impact the development of the industry. If it is not done well, it will not only fail to increase the financial revenue of the kingdom, but will reduce our income on the contrary!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the difficulty of implementation, the easiest and quickest way to collect taxes is to directly distribute tasks to the provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, we can actually consider giving proper care to economically poor provinces, and let other rich provinces bear the burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The seven northern provinces that have just been recovered are still in the development stage, and it is difficult to undertake too heavy obligations in a short period of time, so they will not be assigned to them this year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a look of concern for the country and the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the tit-for-tat confrontation with Hudson earlier, maybe everyone would really believe it. It's a pity that everyone is not a fool, and this kind of blatant targeting can be seen at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to be able to achieve strategic goals, Earl Pierce would rather let the southeastern provinces bear heavier debt repayment obligations, but also reduce the financial resources of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculated purely from direct economic losses, this is a typical \"killing eight hundred enemies and self-defeating one thousand tactics\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, as the eldest, the Dalton family has the most fiefdoms, and naturally needs to bear the heaviest debt repayment obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to see it, this is an overt conspiracy on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoned the all-out attack plan, the newly emerging aristocratic group that was temporarily united because of interests suddenly fell apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to implement a comprehensive suppression. Although the veteran nobles were unwilling, they could accept it considering that the southeastern province was willing to take on heavier obligations and be able to beat Hudson, the leader of the emerging nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the eyes of the crowd watching the excitement, Hudson noticed the pleasure of revenge from the eyes of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can only say \"June's debt, pay it quickly.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just messed up other people's disarmament plan, now it's time to pay the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the facts, Hudson couldn't believe that Earl Pierce would be so decisive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the emerging nobles who bowed their heads, it is obvious that this fragile group does not yet have the confidence to fight against the established nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps out of the shame of retreating from the battle, I dare not look at him now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is watching what I do. Since Earl Pierce has such a high awareness, how can I hold everyone back at this time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to grit his teeth and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, he just sat on the seat without saying a word. It was as if he had made a difficult decision in order to maintain the dignity of the poor aristocrats due to the general situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also a few middle-class nobles in the southeastern province who also look bitter.

This time, he was the first bird and violated the interests of a group of veteran nobles. How should he end up next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment, Earl Pierce came out in time to stab the knife and directly helped him through the difficulty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is busy gloating and watching his jokes, even if the resentment in their hearts has not completely disappeared, it is estimated that there will not be much left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, he also sold out to the king. He fell to this point, but it was caused by working for the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson's previous performance was not too active, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the veteran nobles, Earl Pierce's actions would not have been so easy to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the gang of emerging aristocrats are too timid, even if Hudson is the first bird, others dare not follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Hudson, who originally wanted to establish himself in the kingdom as the spokesperson of the emerging nobles, instantly dismissed this idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's good to be the boss, but it's better to be the boss of this kind of unreliable group!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being the boss doesn't mean breaking these relationships. On the contrary, Hudson will continue to deepen the relationship with the emerging aristocratic groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being cowardly now does not mean being cowardly in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the political weakness of these people is caused by their own lack of strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson himself, if the military strength in his hands is not weak, no matter how high Caesar III bids, he would not dare to enter this muddy water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the strength in your hands is not weak, in the face of the general trend, you still have to admit cowardly when you should be cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that the consequences seem to be serious, but the actual harm is not great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"repayment tax\" seems to be a huge number, but the Alpha Kingdom has 32 provinces. Even if the newly recovered seven northern provinces are excluded, there are still 25 provinces to share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how proud Earl Pierce was, he would never be able to take advantage of him and transfer all the tax money to the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the traditional distribution, the tax share that the wealthy southeastern provinces need to bear is at most ten to fifteen percent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many nobles in the province sharing the share, judging from many factors such as the area of ​​the fiefdom and the economic development, what ultimately falls on the Koslow family is nothing more than one-tenth to one-eighth of the provincial tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the carriage had time to leave the palace, it was stopped halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Earl, Your Highness the Crown Prince invites you to discuss matters!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid's crisp voice interrupted Hudson's plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Caesar III was really about to lose his hold. In recent days, the Crown Prince has been extremely active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Banquet this great nobleman today, and invite that great nobleman tomorrow. Even among the middle class nobles, he never forgot to win them over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lead the way ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back home, Earl Pierce suddenly suppressed his smile. Obviously, he, the winner, was not as excited as the outside world imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to interrupt the development of the Koslow family, the means used today are disgraceful. At least in the eyes of the nobles in the southeast province, he is incompetent as the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war bond in the tax is easy to solve, the big deal is that the Dalton family will eat it in one bite. Think of it as a financial investment, anyway, this is a capital-guaranteed transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only hundreds of thousands of gold coins. It is undoubtedly worth paying such a small price in order to win people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is the repayment tax. With him, the boss, taking the initiative, it is certain that the share of the southeast province will not be low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the fifteen counties in the province, only Wright County is completely under the control of the Koslow family. This is the result of wanton replacement of fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few newly reclaimed lands, but unfortunately none of them are recorded in the kingdom's records. It is almost impossible to expect Hudson to cooperate with the investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Wright County is a large county, the share that needs to be borne is very limited, and the remaining share has to be borne by the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family will naturally bear the largest share, but the younger brothers will inevitably lose their money. Everyone has complaints in their hearts, which is almost inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the Dalton family was the dominant family. When this happened, everyone could only endure it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has changed slightly. Although such a trivial matter is not enough to make everyone take the risk of jumping back to support the Koslow family, some comfort is still necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the neutral camp with the largest number of people needs to pay more attention to it, and it must not be won over by the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, considering the financial resources of the Koslow family, Earl Pierce instantly relieved his worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the family was weak, and they were still doing a lot of infrastructure construction. Now that they have been drawn blood again, the pressure on the Koslow family can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to take care of yourself, so where is the spare energy to win people's hearts?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Koslow family suspends some construction projects and squeezes out a sum of money, it must first help the existing younger brothers instead of trying to win over the neutral faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone is short of financial resources, who else in the southeastern province has the spare power to help the small nobles besides the Dalton family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important to know that the \"repayment tax\" is not only collected for one year, but will continue for many years, and the amount of collection is still more than one year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is indeed rich, but it can't stand the continuous toss. The little nobles who have just recovered from the war will have a high probability of suffering in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that more than one-third of the minor nobles in the province will have more or less financial problems. Either cut overhead, or go into debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, but the plan succeeded?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler Gadri asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The plan failed and succeeded at the same time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Hudson is still too young. He lost himself after being touted for a few words, and actually regarded himself as the spokesperson of the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan to cut military spending was shattered under his agitation, including me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he paid dearly for it, and our backup proposal passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has no foundation and basically can't help financially. Next, let's look at Hudson, how much benefit he made in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to keep an eye on the Koslow family. Once the finances are in trouble, Hudson is likely to take the risk of dealing with some shady spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Collect the evidence first, and then look for an opportunity to attack them after the plan of the Warcraft Legion is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it may also be a bargaining chip for negotiations. As long as the Koslow family is willing to move their headquarters out of the southeastern province, everyone can continue to be friends! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost an open secret that combat troops divide up the loot that can be taken away. As the commander-in-chief of the army, it is also an unspoken rule to take the biggest piece of cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is limited to some ordinary trophies, or unowned trophies, and there are also some trophies that need to be returned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously returned to the owner, this is just an ideal state. The various armies participating in the war were not so \"honest\", and were basically divided up in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is doing this, as long as some items with special significance or the identity of the original owner that can prove their identity are not sold publicly, it is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why Hudson carts and carts pulled the spoils home after the war. It's not that there is no way to sell, but that they dare not sell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news leaks out, the owner finds out that he is suspicious, and makes a fuss regardless, his noble reputation will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is to take it home and store it first. After the turmoil is over, either find an opportunity to sell it in batches, or directly enrich your own heritage inventory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rich family background of the great nobles was gradually accumulated in this way. Items that cannot see the light now do not mean that they will not see the light in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time can dilute everything. Even an item with an owner will become an ownerless item after the baptism of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you make up a reason to resell the item to the original owner, it is not impossible to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, according to the information we have collected, the Earl of Hudson took at least four million gold coins worth of spoils in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    About one-third of it was cash, and the other third was large sums of war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly based on the bonds of the Principality of Moxi, at least more than one million, and the kingdom's war bonds are also hundreds of thousands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from all aspects of the situation, the Earl of Hudson should have realized part of the war bonds in private, otherwise the cash in hand alone would not be able to support the current expenses of the mountain leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that he has a good relationship with the major chambers of commerce, and the remaining part of the spoils that cannot be realized in time is likely to be monetized overseas through the channels of these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the finances of the Mountain Territory should be able to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Restricted by the fact that the monster breeding base is located in the mountainous area, it is not convenient for us to use many means to consume his financial resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we can only wait for the impact of the repayment tax to further ferment and consume the last financial resources of the Koslow family before taking further actions and continuing to put pressure on them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the old butler's answer, Earl Pierce frowned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Gadri is opposed to a direct showdown with the Koslow family, but advocates boiling frogs in warm water to force this competitor away by economic means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Housekeeper, although Hudson is a little aggressive in territory construction, he is still very frugal in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, I neither like holding banquets nor obsessed with various activities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that costs money is probably the magic experiment, but as a mage, there is nothing to say about being keen on magic research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a matter of fact, the current Koslow family does not show the face of a nouveau riche. The standard of living of most clansmen is not much different from that of ordinary noble families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to further consume their financial resources, I am afraid it will not be easy to do so! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had it not been for this information, which had been verified by many parties, Earl Pierce would not have believed that Hudson could make so much money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not terrible just to make money, the key is that not only does he not spend money indiscriminately, but he also restrains his clansmen to be thrifty together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information collected by the Dalton family, the Mountain Territory does not have much cash, but the most expensive project has been completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the budget is still in deficit in the future, relying on the dividends brought by the Warcraft breeding base, as long as the progress of various projects in the territory is slowed down, a balance can be barely achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of repayment tax, with the sale of spoils, can last for several years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a few more years of buffering, the Koslow family has gained a firm foothold, and it will be difficult to get them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, no matter how frugal the Koslow family is, some necessary expenses are still indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You seem to have forgotten that their relatives are all over the province. With so many relatives, there are always a few who can't hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can ignore the nobles of the neutral faction, but they can't ignore the relatives and friends who support them, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too risky to directly attack the Koslow family, but it is much simpler to set up a game against these small nobles. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, the two looked at each other and smiled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little nobles' ability to resist risks is inherently low. If someone deliberately sets up a situation, it will be difficult to think of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For these small characters, the Dalton family doesn't even need to take action personally, just a hint that it is within the scope of the rules can cause them heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, they didn't do this, because they have enough advantages, and there is no need to drop the bottom line like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plus there is also Caesar III staring at it, if you are not careful, you will be caught by the king, and you will be unable to eat and walk around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The critically ill king has greatly reduced his deterrent power to everyone. Some methods that he dared not use before can now be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, I have lost a lot of money in this transaction. You have to sell a few senior craftsmen to me as compensation!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knows that the repayment tax cannot be avoided if the Alpha Kingdom does not breach the contract, this does not affect Hudson's complaints.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the extra repayment tax this time is all drawn out by working hard for the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there hadn't been this turmoil, Earl Pierce would not have taken the initiative to take responsibility, and the southeastern province would not have to bear excessive obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you still can't avoid the repayment tax, when it is apportioned to the Koslow family, you can still pay 20,000 to 30,000 gold coins less every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One or two years is enough, the key is continuous, until the debt is paid off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, rest assured, the royal promise will definitely be fulfilled. We will not transfer any of the experienced craftsmen and boatmen in the shipyard, and they will definitely satisfy you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the faint disdain on the brows, which still reveals his contempt for Hudson deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few craftsmen in the district had to raise it individually, and it was really hard for him to take a fancy to them because of their strong pettiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a shipyard and sailors, want to participate in ocean trade?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is purely a dream!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the view of Crown Prince Caesar, building a ship is very simple, but the most difficult thing is to create a defensive magic circle for the ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these things, once encountering monsters at sea, the fate of shipwreck and human death will be lost in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magician team of the Koslow family obviously does not have the strength to create an advanced magic circle for the ship, so they will definitely ask the Magic Association for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to be ripped off, the guys from the Mage Association are still very thieves, and they won't draw a high-level defensive magic circle at all if they don't take out precious magic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The script is written.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar was ready, and after Hudson hit a wall everywhere, he turned to the royal family for help and took the opportunity to accept a younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then thank you, Your Highness, for taking care of me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know which shipyard the royal family is selling and how much is the price? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is impatient, it's actually a seller's market now. To be called a large shipyard, not only must it be able to build large merchant ships, it must also have the ability to produce warships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, these are not for sale. As long as someone is willing to sell, even if there is a pit behind, Hudson can only jump into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the shipbuilding technology of the mountain leader so much ahead of the canoe?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely no problem to make a three-panel boat, and you can also build a five-panel boat if you work hard. As for ocean-going merchant ships and warships, they might be able to find out after another hundred years of hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since your Excellency the Earl is one of your own, I won't open my mouth. The shipyard that the royal family wants to sell is in the southeast province, which is just convenient for you to relocate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name, I guess you have heard of it. I was originally in charge of naval logistics, but you should know better than me what happened later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of the shipyard is 800,000 gold coins, and the 1,700 craftsmen and 300 sailors in the shipyard, together with their family members of more than 6,800 people, are directly regarded as gifts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the offer from Crown Prince Caesar, Hudson wanted to say very much: Just a gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this is impossible. If I really do this, I will have no friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He hesitated for a while, but in the end he still didn't open his mouth to bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, this price is already very fair, and it can even be said to be generous. The shipyard that Crown Prince Caesar was talking about was the well-known Berkshire Shipyard in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At its peak, it was once one of the three major shipyards in the kingdom. It's just that as the kingdom's strategy shifted to the mainland, the importance of coastal defense continued to decline. After the navy orders were gone, it had to turn to the civilian market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in recent decades, the Dalton family's maritime business has advanced by leaps and bounds, gradually monopolizing most of the overseas trade in the southeastern province, and by the way, they have also built their own shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Berkshire Shipyard, which has lost a large number of orders, is getting worse day by day. If it weren't for the power of the royal family, it would have been squeezed out by the Dalton family long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    survived on sporadic orders, but the performance of Berkshire Shipyard is very touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the profit of more than 100,000 gold coins a year in the peak period, it has dropped sharply to 10,000 to 20,000 gold coins a year now, and there will be losses in bad years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, it is only a matter of time before Berkshire Shipyard goes bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to sell to Hudson at this juncture. In addition to political transactions, there is also concern that the new king will not be able to deter the local nobles during the throne change period and will dispose of risky assets in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just follow His Highness's price!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the amount of funds involved in this transaction is too large. I won't be able to spend so much money for a while. I wonder if the royal family can accept the offset in kind? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since I decided to act, I had to do a full set. It was only when the front foot released a signal of lack of money, and the second foot was to buy a shipyard with a large amount of money, everyone knew that there was a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this critical moment, Hudson doesn't want to make a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family thinks that there is a financial problem in the mountain region, so they will continue to lead them to this, so as to save them from doing things behind the scenes and ruining the deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Earl, the royal family is not unreasonable. We have always taken care of our own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you do have financial difficulties, you can naturally offset it in kind. However, the items to be offset must be what we need! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This wave of \"repayment tax\" apportionment, the southeastern province has taken over the bulk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After much deliberation, in addition to Earl Pierce's proposed repayment of 6 million principal, the shortfall in bond interest paid by the finance department will also be apportioned to the repayment tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final total amount of \"repayment tax\" was fixed at 9.37 million gold coins. A total of 1.3 million gold coins were apportioned to the southeast province, accounting for nearly 14%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a high proportion of undertakings is short of engraved on the head-\"take advantage of\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it is not easy to be taken advantage of in any world. The repayment tax of 1.3 million in the southeastern province will be shared by the nobles of the 15 counties in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for Earl Pierce's younger brothers who can still laugh, the expressions of the others are not very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the little nobles who were already in financial difficulties, their faces were even more gloomy and terrifying at the moment, as if their parents had died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People who are in a good mood get together to chat and chat, and those who are in a bad mood get together to complain to each other, and soon the team becomes two distinct waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing several mid-level nobles in the province join Earl Pierce's team one after another, Hudson immediately realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation was very obvious. Earl Pierce obviously realized how much hatred he had done, and took action in advance to win over the powerful factions in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from emerging aristocrats who need to spend a lot of money on construction, established aristocrats only need to operate the fief step by step, and they don't need much capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they pay an extra repayment tax now, the impact on them is very limited, nothing more than feeling a little uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the influence of the Dalton family, it couldn't be easier to appease everyone. Maybe they will not only lose money, but also have a chance to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: acquiescing to some of their small actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone bears the economic loss together, and the worst must be the little nobles at the bottom. Otherwise, there will be a bunch of unlucky people who will fall into the family because of financial bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here is the opportunity!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to wantonly annex the land, but with the cooperation of the Governor's Mansion, there is still hope for taking one or two knight collars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially at this moment, Caesar III's physical condition is worrying, and the kingship may change at any time, and the probability of taking advantage is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, most of the land mergers within the Alpha Kingdom in the past hundred years have occurred during the period of kingship change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the lower the prestige of the new monarch, the longer it takes to control the court, the greater the appetite of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Straightening his mind, Hudson's original idea of ​​taking the opportunity to win over the nobles in the province was instantly dispelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone is eligible to participate in the feast of land annexation. As an emerging nobleman, the Koslow family has not even digested the results of the current battle, and it is easy to fall into the target of public criticism if they engage in land annexation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the family, I can't engage in land annexation to strengthen my strength. The best choice is to let the southeastern province maintain the status quo first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the strategy of the Koslow family is contrary to the interests of the veteran nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talking is not speculative, let alone a conflict of interests. Doomed not to be a one-way person, running to win people's hearts is a waste of effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little nobles below seem to be easy to win over, and their interests are also in line with the Koslow family's strategy. Unfortunately, this group is too complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are salted fish nobles who want to maintain the status quo; there are also enterprising nobles who are waiting for the death of Caesar III, hoping to fish in troubled waters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the salted fish nobles is usually not very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their own strength is very limited, and they cannot withstand the wind and rain. Just surviving consumes all their efforts, and there is no soil for breeding ambitions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really win over, we don't know how much strength we can increase, but the burden it will bring is heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the latter, the Koslow family a few years ago was an enterprising little nobleman, who directly used the system to force his children to continue to forge ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting such an aggressive younger brother, you can know it without thinking, and there will definitely be troubles in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the younger brothers match their own strength and ambition, that's fine. What I'm most afraid of is encountering a few scammers with high eyesight and low power, which will bring bad luck to the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making up his mind to wait and see the situation first, Hudson complained about everyone's complaints, and he didn't have the mind to pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the new younger brother may not be accepted, but the younger brother who has already been recruited has to be taken care of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who are now mixed with the Koslow family are mainly composed of two parts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Part of him followed Hudson to fight the world. He was used to his rise and rise, and he had too much confidence in him as the boss, so he defected here without thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roots of these people may not necessarily be deep, but they eat meat and drink soup with Hudson all the way. Whether it is military strength or their own financial resources, they are all top-notch among the minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other part of the younger brothers are old relatives and friends in the past, and the little nobles who just completed the marriage not long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rise of Hudson, it is impossible to marry the Koslow family without any family background. The little nobles who are poor and white cannot catch the eyes of the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now those who are really in difficulty and need financial help are only a small number of unlucky ones among relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to various reasons, he perfectly missed the road to Hudson's rise and failed to catch a bowl of broth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, shall we let the governor do whatever he wants?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A familiar voice rang from his ears, interrupting the thoughts in Hudson's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, you are too impatient. The game has just begun, why bother with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, we may not really suffer. Everyone paid more together, and the Dalton family needed to spend the most gold coins among the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family background of the veteran nobles is indeed rich, but it is also accumulated by the ancestors for countless years. According to Earl Pierce's current tossing method, it is impossible for the Dalton family to have no opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One or two losses, everyone can still take the overall situation into consideration. Once the number of losses increases, it will be difficult to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you have a point. If we let it go completely, people might think we are afraid of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is good, let someone release the news, and say: Earl Pierce knows everyone's suffering, if you have no money, you can go to the Dalton family to borrow it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, a rumor may not be of much use. The Dalton family is deeply rooted in the southeastern province, and ordinary minor nobles dare not provoke him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we take the lead in the dark, organize the nobles in the province to fight against him and refuse to pay the repayment tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is also a serious problem. Once things become serious, the kingdom will definitely be disturbed. In order to raise funds for debt repayment, there is a high probability that various domestic forces will require us to continue to fulfill our tax obligations! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the little brother in front of him, Hudson doubted very much whether he had raised someone for nothing, and then he understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately's ability is indeed not bad, but after a series of blows, his confidence has long been wiped out, without the original arrogance and drive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you start your own business, this change is catastrophic. But as a younger brother, it's better not to be too ambitious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What you're talking about is just the normal situation. Humans are the most complicated creatures. Once pushed, they can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for them to go to war with the Dalton family. We only need to gather a group of small nobles who are financially bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy at the critical moment, and run to the gate of the Governor's Mansion to cry poorly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to find the governor, these are official business. Our Governor Pierce is a responsible aristocrat, because of him, everyone's life is difficult, so we can't let it go! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are inconspicuous little tricks, but at critical moments, they can make Earl Pierce in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't help, it will affect your reputation if you spread the word;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to win over a bunch of shabby people to settle down and offend the powerful factions in the province, no matter how you look at it, it is a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, Caesar III, who was supporting himself after sending away all the nobles in the country, lay down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, everyone was called this time, and there was another task-to formally confer meritorious officials in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Caesar III's body couldn't hold on and he couldn't preside over the ceremony. Simply use the kingdom system: conferring nobles once every five years as an excuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it has been less than half a year since the last noble canonization, and it will be five years. Under normal circumstances, this kind of thing will be done together to save everyone another trip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the rules can be changed. Anyway, the actual benefits are all in hand, and now the only thing missing is a ceremony. No one wants to compete with the king on this small issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, dying people are not easy to mess with!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can guarantee that the current Caesar III can always remain rational. If he accidentally provoked him into a panic, and he insisted on dragging the early bird to meet the Lord of Dawn with his name behind him, wouldn't it be a tragedy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Caesar, from now on, all the affairs of the kingdom will be in your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since our ancestors founded the Alpha Kingdom, it has been passed down for more than 300 years. During this period, we have survived countless winds and rains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you have the best Alpha Kingdom and the worst Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the threat of orcs, we can develop wholeheartedly and catch up with several powerful countries in the Southern Continent; but also because of this, the country is no longer united as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current dispute is just the beginning. As time goes by, the kingdom's internal strife will become more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember one principle: Stability trumps everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this basis, you have to vigorously develop the royal family's foundation and maintain the balance among the major domestic forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles are the pillars of the kingdom, but the small and medium nobles are the foundation of the royal family. No matter how the situation develops, they cannot be allowed to carry out land annexation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have already paved the way for you, it is up to you how to go next. All I can do now is to hold on for a few more days and fight for the last time for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Little...Caesar...you...will...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, Caesar III couldn't even connect the sentences together, and spit out words intermittently, which made everyone's tears fall straight down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar in front of the bed cried even more, but he continued to respond until Caesar III lost consciousness and fell into a coma on the bed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priests and magicians guarding the vicinity hurried forward and poured a bottle of mysterious potion into the mouth of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, little Caesar. Your Majesty is tired and needs to rest. You are also an adult, you have to learn to face it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from His Majesty's physical condition, he can support it for another three months at most. You must control the court within these three months, and the complete power transfer will be smooth! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Tyron said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most outstanding king of the Alpha Kingdom is coming to the end of his life. No one knows what the next era will be like.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people present in the ward at this moment are all members of the royal family. We are all grasshoppers on the same rope, we all prosper and we all lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there any way to make my father live longer? No matter what the price is, no matter what treasure is needed, I will try my best to find it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Father's love is like a mountain, and I don't feel it very much in normal times, but when it's time for life and death, it suddenly becomes prominent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bits and pieces of the past kept reappearing in his mind. Even if he got into trouble and was beaten, it has now become a good memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, little Caesar. You are the next monarch of the kingdom, don't act like a little girl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty's body is exhausted, so don't torment him anymore. What you have to do is to take control of the court as soon as possible and let him sleep peacefully. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Archbishop Tyrone extinguished the last hope of Crown Prince Caesar. Without his father who can shield him from the wind and rain, he fell into endless hesitation at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long time, he nodded seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, my father has repeatedly explained: If I ask you for advice on political issues, where should I start?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Crown Prince Caesar has grown up, but the price of growth is really heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the central government has been run by our royal family for hundreds of years, and most of the core important positions are in the hands of the royal family, so there is basically no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real trouble you need to face now is still in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the royal family's jurisdiction, other major provinces are under the control of local nobles, and there are not many places where we can intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem in the previous kingship changes was that the local nobles took the opportunity to annex land. Now the strength of the great nobles in the country is already very strong, and their power cannot be allowed to continue to expand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, His Majesty has already left you a countermeasure, which is to use the mutual restraint among the nobles to maintain the balance of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the days to come, whoever dares to carry out land mergers will be suppressed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make up for yesterday\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After demonstrating his economic power, he successfully obtained the qualification to visit the shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't understand the specific technical things, but from the pile of \"iron oak\", we can see the background of the shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many woods that can be used to build ships, but there are very few woods that are suitable for drawing magic circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Iron Oak\" is one of them, and because of its wide distribution in the Alpha Kingdom, it has become the main raw material for shipbuilding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this \"wider distribution\" is also compared to other types of wood, and it is far from the point of bad streets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the Salam Mountains where Hudson is located, there is no shadow of \"iron oak\". Even one hundred and fifty years ago, the entire southeastern province could not see the shadow of \"iron oak\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This situation lasted until the rise of the Dalton family before it was introduced into its own territory for planting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that trees are not grown in a day. It is said that the elves have life magic that can ripen vegetation, but that stuff is their core secret, and it is far away from Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the planting is introduced immediately, in the next few decades, he will still have to spend money to buy \"iron oak\" from the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is Caesar III's calculation again. Using a shipyard on the verge of bankruptcy to bind a great nobleman for decades is not a loss in any way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But everything has two sides. If the royal family wants to hold the Koslow family, it has to support their development of maritime trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the interests obtained by the Koslow family from the sea are large enough, the \"short boards\" they hold in their hands have sufficient value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there was a pitfall, Hudson jumped into it decisively. The main reason was that it was too risky to get involved in maritime trade in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to shorten this tuition payment cycle, the best way is to find a master to take you with you. You don't expect to make much money in a short period of time, as long as you can train your team, it is considered a strategic success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the sales staff's enthusiastic and continuous introduction, Hudson knew that Berkshire Shipyard's life was difficult, otherwise the staff of such a monopoly enterprise would not be able to restrain their arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Baden, look at those giant buildings, they are all the shipyards of our Berkshire Shipyard, and the largest shipyard can even build 10,000-ton giant ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only in theory. Under normal circumstances, no one would be foolish to build such a big toy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is engaged in inland river transportation, then a cargo ship of 500 to 1,000 tons is almost enough, and if it is larger, navigation will be restricted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are engaged in ocean-going trade, choosing a large ship of two to three thousand tons is enough. No matter how big it is, the cost is high, and such a large space is simply not used in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just my personal suggestion, and the specific choice is still up to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, we can build all the mainstream ships on the mainland, including warships for the navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this list, the parameters of the ship types that can be selected are recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not satisfied, you can also ask our designers to design individually according to your requirements, but the cost will be slightly increased. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can warships be sold?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a landlubber lord, he is a pure layman when it comes to matters at sea. However, as a part-time arms dealer, he knows very well that arms trade is far more profitable than normal trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the arms trade is often linked to politics. Selling ordinary swords, guns, swords and halberds is fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons of mass destruction such as magic crystal cannons and magic crossbows cannot be bought simply with money. They must have a certain status to be eligible for trading.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In principle, it is not allowed, but if Mr. Baden is really interested, it is not impossible to be flexible. It mainly depends on how you trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you follow the right path, you will be contacted by higher-level managers after I report, but the threshold is a bit high and there are many restrictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you take the dark path, it will be much simpler. As long as you are willing to add money, all follow-up work will be handed over to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the magic crystal cannon is a bit troublesome. The Kingdom controls these items too strictly, so there is no guarantee that they will be available at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can get the goods, the price is skyrocketing. However, we can use ballista instead. It is definitely not as powerful as the magic crystal cannon, but it is cheaper. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the sales staff gave Hudson a new understanding of the situation at Berkshire Shipyard. If it weren't for being poor and crazy, he would never be able to privately sell warships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what level of warship it is, but from the tone of the salesperson, I reckon that as long as the money is enough, I can sell anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that before the orcs invaded, Hudson had to work hard to get a magic crystal cannon, but now someone dares to sell it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the royal family's property is different. When it comes to business, it is more courageous than ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Berkshire Shipyard can persist until now, not by scattered shipbuilding orders from outside, but by warships ordered privately by pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After figuring out the situation at the Berkshire Shipyard, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but secretly delighted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to secretly sell warships to pirates means that the technical level of the shipyard to build warships is at least above the level of building pirate ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Barnes, just by the way. As a serious businessman, how could I buy a warship?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are mainly engaged in ocean trade and deal with pirates every day. We must also have certain weapons to protect ourselves! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson explained with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    is just the end result, something backfired. The more Hudson insisted that he was a serious businessman, the more Barnes thought he was a pirate's wayfinder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on Barnes' many years of sales experience, the more the visitor hides his identity and the more mysterious he is, the more likely he is a big client.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that Hudson possesses all of them. With his clumsy camouflage skills and the domineering hidden between his brows, he is not a serious maritime merchant at first glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Baden, don't worry. We also sell armed merchant ships here, but they look a bit like warships, and their performance is similar to warships, but they are definitely not warships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The merchant shipping approval issued by the kingdom is the best evidence! With these approval documents, you can definitely drive the ship away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Barnes' eloquent explanations, Hudson decisively chose to escape. He couldn't stay here any longer, otherwise he would almost believe that he was a pirate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With confidence in mind, the follow-up transaction will naturally go smoothly. However, the shipyard is still in the hands of the royal family and continues to operate, and the relocation work must wait until the next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent external interference from destroying this transaction, the transaction will be kept strictly confidential before the relocation work is fully started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that there is a group of strangers in the mountains. They crossed the endless swamp and ran to the seaside to start exploration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ports and shipyards need to be carefully selected. If you just choose a piece of land for construction, you can't build a large dock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the 10,000-ton large dock, Hudson does not have such a big appetite, but there must be a 1,000-ton conventional dock, otherwise it will become an inland shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beda City, after some fierce quarrels, the share of the \"repayment tax\" was forcibly distributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone's interest is not very high, as if they have become selfless saints, even if the allocation is slightly more, they don't bother to argue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Hudson and Earl Pierce who were the most active. In order to repay the tax share, the two almost had a \"duel\" in the conference room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is Governor Pierce's private promise to everyone. Otherwise, the county guards whose interests have been damaged will definitely be the main force besieging the governor at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout the meeting, Hudson's situation was just two words-embarrassing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the sheriffs at the meeting were either members of the Dalton family, or were promised benefits by Earl Pierce, and Hudson was completely alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only representative of the Holliser family who can be regarded as an ally, after the shift of strategic focus, became a dumb to make up the numbers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The days of \"lonely family and widows\" will naturally not be easy. Fortunately, all the sheriffs present were only doing things with money and did not completely fall for the Dalton family, otherwise life would be even more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no 1v14, but Hudson still achieved 1v7. It's scary to think about it. Among the 15 counties in the southeastern province, there are seven counties whose sheriff positions are controlled by the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearly 30% of the land was planted with the Dalton family's flag, and the area under the control of the younger brother will be even larger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for his strong rise, it would only be a matter of time before the Dalton family annexed the southeastern province if this situation continued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are also happening in other provinces of the kingdom. And this kind of land annexation, along with the continuous growth of the great nobles' own strength, will accelerate even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you want to believe it or not, the kingdom's political system, which relies on small and medium nobles to check and balance the big ones, is gradually collapsing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder Caesar III wants to create conflicts among the great nobles and play with political balance. If no action is taken and the land annexation is allowed to continue, there is a high probability that there will only be double-digit players left in the future Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When that situation really comes to that, there will be no relaxation between each other, and only the last step is left to turn the country into a family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only a theoretical state. Under normal circumstances, if a country cannot support the most extreme state of land annexation, it will collapse early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of collapse may be caused by the invasion of foreign enemies, or it may be caused by internal struggles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter whether it is a great aristocrat or a royal family, it is impossible to guarantee that every generation of heirs will have an online IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are two or three generations of prodigal sons in a row, or a big prodigal son is born, the family business accumulated by the ancestors can be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a whale falls, all things are born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time a big noble falls, many new small and medium nobles will be born, and then a new round of land annexation will start, as if it is a cyclical cycle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson leave with a dark face, Earl Pierce showed a meaningful smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I can't compare to you in fighting with soldiers. Could it be that playing politics can't handle you as a stupefied young man!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of joy cannot be shared with others, otherwise it will easily ruin his stalwart image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, something seems to be wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the meeting just now, although Earl Hudson was trying his best to fight for it, he was too calm to find a trace of panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to previous speculation, he should bring a group of minor nobles to the meeting to make trouble. We have all made plans and are ready to take the opportunity to label him as disregarding the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that throughout the meeting, he suppressed his anger and didn't leave us any chance, as if he knew our plan in advance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler's reminder startled Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a handful of people in the family who know about this plan. If someone leaks the secret, it will be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the dark guards check it out, the people in the family who are closely related to the Koslow family, and arrange people to watch their every move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just a preparation, and this matter should not be a secret they leaked. If a little personal friendship was enough to betray the family, betrayal seemed cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rise of Hudson is too short, and it is impossible to insert the hidden son so quickly. If the news could be received in advance, there must be other forces involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest suspects are the royal family and the Holliser family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The possibility of the Hollisle family is unlikely. Although they and the Koslow family are allies, it does not mean that they are willing to give unconditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to support our allies, it is not a good choice to offend us at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the probability of the royal family should be higher. Not long ago, Hudson helped the royal family, and it was only right to take the opportunity to return him a favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is another possibility, that is, all our guesses are wrong, there is no leak at all, Hudson guessed our plan by himself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Pierce frowned. It would be terrible if Hudson could gain insights into their plans all by his own analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, he is more willing to believe that this is just a coincidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the royal family probably helped him with this matter. According to the information from the spies from the mountain collar, Hudson has already organized people to conduct exploration by the seaside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the insider, the artificial river excavated in the mountainous area will be completed by the end of the year. Hudson's move is likely to be preparing to build a pier by the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to further verify the authenticity, we sent people to check the identity information of the prospectors, and found that these people are all working for the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the Earl of Hudson has further connections with the royal family secretly, otherwise he would not have received such strong support. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler's words made Earl Pierce's face even more gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The upstart Koslow family alone is difficult enough, but if the royal family is involved, it will be even more difficult to solve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he already believed in the speculation that the two families colluded. After all, these are the routines of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Use some small means that are beneficial and cost-effective to provoke conflicts among the great nobles, so that everyone can be tied together to ensure the supremacy of the royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can see it, it is useless to tell the other party. The Dalton family and the Koslow family are competitors. It is impossible for Earl Pierce to stop here, and it is impossible for Hudson to back down indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
