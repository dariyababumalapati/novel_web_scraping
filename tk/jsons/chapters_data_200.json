Cattle are worth more than people most of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to open up wasteland, since Hudson entered the mountain territory, he has vigorously developed the cattle industry. Has purchased hundreds of breeding cattle from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Up to the present, the mountain collar has grown to a herd of over a thousand cattle, but calves account for a large proportion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the development needs of the territory, they cannot all be taken away. What's more, ordinary cattle are not suitable for the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who really meet the requirements are the descendants of the mutant cows with improved physical strength, endurance, and explosive power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time is too short after all, the descendants of the mutant cows are all in the growth stage, except for the breeding cow, the rest are underage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the standard is lowered, including those who are over one and a half years old, it is only a little over two hundred. Such a large number obviously cannot meet the demand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the core platform of an army, the heavy infantry may seem inconspicuous, but it is the most important unit in large-scale field battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, Hudson is going to be equipped with one-fifteenth of the total force, that is: armed with 1,000 heavy infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the heavy infantry in the private army of other nobles, that is the business of the younger brothers themselves, and his hands are not that long yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Noble lords are obliged to perform military service, but they have a very high degree of autonomy in the allocation of arms. Hudson had neither the right nor the need to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic gentlemen will never take things lightly when it comes to their own lives. Even if the configuration is unreasonable, it will not be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many infantry, in addition to increasing field capabilities, the most important thing is to be beaten, and the survival rate of soldiers is high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Protected by armor and shields, it can block most of the enemy's attacks. Often after a war is fought, the casualty rate of heavy infantry is less than one-tenth of that of other soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to cultivate the elite, and Hudson can't bear the loss too much. Although I was ready to \"strategic turn\" alone at any time, it was under the circumstances of being unable to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can win, no one wants to choose to flee in a hurry. If you want to win a battle, increasing the strength of your troops is undoubtedly the key factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a little higher cost and a little slower movement speed, heavy infantry has almost no obvious shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not enough cattle, so other animals can only make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Naval Cavalry\", \"Mule Cavalry\", and \"Donkey Cavalry\" can all be arranged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they didn't expect it, so they fought against the orc cavalry. Just carry the heavy infantry forward, save the soldiers' physical strength, and increase the marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if you bully some orc scum with a combat power of only five, it is not impossible to use them as cavalry directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem with the mount equipment is the logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, cattle are the best. A bale of grass and some fodder will do the trick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mules, donkeys, and rough horses are easy to raise. The real thing to worry about is the war horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forage, that is eaten in normal times, but must be eaten in wartime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For balanced nutrition, beans, bran, and grains are all necessary, and sometimes eggs are even added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standard of food is close to that of nobles, much more expensive than ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The larger the number of animals equipped, the greater the logistical pressure. Fortunately, this kind of war does not require you to bring your own dry food, otherwise Hudson would collapse on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With heavy infantry, archers are naturally indispensable. Against an orc army lacking armor protection, archers can often play unexpected roles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five hundred archers, this is most of Hudson's wealth. All of them are equipped with strong bows of the Alpha Kingdom, with a maximum range of 300 meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bow is 1.5 meters long, the bow body is made of high-quality wood, and the bowstring is hemp fiber.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest difference from ordinary bows and arrows is that these strong bows need to be soaked in a special magic reagent for three days after they are made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bow and arrow with added materials are naturally powerful. The arrows shot by a qualified archer can easily penetrate leather armor, cloth armor, and even some iron armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are they good at fighting small soldiers, even if they encounter elite orcs, these strong archers can also play a big role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, heavy infantry is always a minority. The human side doesn't have much equipment, and the orc army has even less equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by the level of productivity, the iron output of the Orc Empire has not been high, and its weapons and equipment are far inferior to that of the Terran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A total of 5,000 troops, cavalry + heavy infantry + crossbowmen accounted for two-fifths, and the remaining arms should naturally be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there are 10,000 troops from the younger brothers, otherwise this unreasonable deployment of troops would definitely scare the orcs when they arrive on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before scaring the orcs, Hudson himself was startled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, the 5,000 army was actually equipped with 1,000 horses and more than 2,000 livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this ratio is extremely abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cuts had to be cut, and it was a logistical nightmare to go out with so many animals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cost is also an important factor. If so many animals are drawn away at once, the land reclamation business in the mountainous area will suffer a heavy blow in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy infantry were the first to do the surgery. One man and one animal was too extravagant. It must be replaced by ox carts, horse carts or mule carts to reduce the number of livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When marching in normal times, the armor is placed on the car, and the soldiers can completely walk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only enter the dangerous area, where an encounter with the orc army may occur at any time, and then put on the armor and drive forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the 2,000-mile journey, the real danger zone was only the 180 miles of the front line, and the heavy infantry didn't have much time to travel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a short period of time, it is necessary to increase the load-bearing capacity of livestock, and you can completely rely on magic potions. Although it is a little extravagant, it is better than taking a large number of livestock on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The demand for livestock for the heavy infantry has been cut, and the cavalry has one man and two horses to become a single horse. When fighting, mount a horse, and walk on two legs like infantry in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (Note: The cavalry has one man and two horses, including one war horse and one naive horse.)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a general who is not prepared to take the initiative to do things, it is completely worthwhile to sacrifice a little mobility in exchange for a reduction in logistical pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest cannot be cut. The mobility of scouts, signal soldiers, and officers must be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of 1,000 war horses remained unchanged, but the number of other livestock was cut in half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for handymen either. The kingdom stipulates the number of soldiers, and even horses cannot replace them, let alone handymen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are not so delicate these days, and elite soldiers can also do chores.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of someone providing logistics, auxiliary soldiers are not required to be equipped. The handyman can go to the place and let the Principality of Moxi provide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guess they will be happy. More soldiers are better than more cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment, apart from the daily belongings, there is no need to worry too much about the rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi cannot guarantee the most basic logistics, he, Lord Hudson, will dare to lead his troops to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this kind of thing, the lawsuit will not be afraid of the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking into the distance, Hudson said slowly: \"Tom, send a message to the nobles in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them prepare enough dried meat for soldiers to eat for three days as a necessary reserve. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things cannot be entrusted to allies. In case of being cheated, there must be emergency measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three days of food reserves will not affect the battle situation. But when running, these jerky can save lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar III looked much better looking at the number of reinforcements reported from various places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number of soldiers has only met the minimum requirements, the livestock accompanying the army can also be added when publicizing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 90,000 soldiers directly became 120,000. If the civilians mobilized from the counties along the way to support the logistics of the army were added, the 200,000 army would not be an exaggeration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the civilian husband not needing to enter the Principality of Moxi with the army, that is just a small problem. Political propaganda, there is no need to be too serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the Principality of Moxi needs now is confidence, and the neighboring small countries also need confidence, and what Caesar III is providing them now is exactly confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is absolutely no comparison between \"90,000 reinforcements\" and \"200,000 reinforcements\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wright County, what's going on with this material demand list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why are so many animal milk, honey, sugar, monster meat, eggs, refined salt specially marked on the logistics materials...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, everything is kept simple. Everyone is going to fight, not to enjoy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These \"luxury food\" marked by Hudson, even high-level noble officers can only supply a small amount, and commit crimes properly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the southeast province also issued a special document explaining the situation in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military department confirmed and found no problems. These extra supplies are not for noble officers to enjoy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County coach Viscount Hudson owns an adult Earth Bear, and these extra supplies are the bear's rations. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Affiero replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft are treated better than humans, which is normal in the continent of Aslante. In particular, the adult high-level monsters that can speak human words are like treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom can require nobles to be frugal and reduce expenses, but it cannot lower the food standards of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether there is an additional amount on the list of supplies, no one knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the card face of the Earth Bear deserves a separate recipe for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an omnivorous creature, the range of recipes is \"billion points\", and the appetite is \"billion points\", which is justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Alpha Kingdom is out, the logistics problem will be the turn of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether these extra supplies end up in the stomachs of bears or the stomachs of frontline officers and soldiers, the Alpha Kingdom will not suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military department and the logistics department simply turned a blind eye, closed one eye, and acquiesced to this list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, then transfer it to the Principality of Moxi!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell Chris IX that in order to support them, I even sent the Earth Bear over there. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The promotional materials delivered to the door are not in vain. Caesar III unceremoniously took the credit for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"200,000 reinforcements\", including the Earth Bear, a weapon of war, is enough to prove that the Alpha Kingdom is doing its best to support its allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bonus brought about by politics is far beyond what can be compared with such a little material.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the bear's daily ration was as high as thousands of pounds, far exceeding the appetite of ordinary earth bears, Caesar III pretended not to see anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Warhammer, Joseph II waited quietly in the mansion of Marshal Borg with a group of ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to disturb the rest of the old marshal, he also specially ordered his servants not to disturb him, doing a good job of being a corporal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the servants of the Marshal's Mansion, it doesn't matter whether they follow the king's will or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics has always been more symbolic than practical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From morning to noon, it seemed that it was already meal time, but Marshal Borg was still missing, and Joseph II was not annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, he drove a great hero back home on trumped-up charges. Now that he suddenly needs it, and wants to invite him out of the mountain, can he prevent him from venting his grievances?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Joseph II was secretly grateful. Fortunately, Marshal Borg was not in a hurry to return to the fief, otherwise he would have to travel hundreds of miles to invite someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle situation on the front line is urgent, and the orc army has already launched a tentative attack from the Principality of Moxi to the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II was really worried if he didn't fool Marshal Borg to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, it is nothing at all to be wronged for the sake of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Corporal Lixian is not only for Marshal Borg, but also for lieutenant generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell everyone with practical actions that he, Joseph II, is not a self-willed master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even political enemies, as long as they have talent, they will also reuse it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long this state can last depends on when the war will end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Prime Minister Gay finished speaking, Joseph II interrupted: \"Don't worry, let the old marshal wake up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are impatient, you can go back to rest first, I will not get in the way if I wait here alone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political show, naturally to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you give up halfway now, it will be a waste of work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to spend all the time here, and it won't make him, the king, hungry and wait here forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How is this going?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why did His Majesty come over and not wake me up? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of reprimand from afar made everyone secretly heave a sigh of relief. The protagonist is finally here, otherwise, if it keeps going on like this, I don't know how it will end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please make amends!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's because I'm not strict with my orders, I kept you waiting for so long!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This man is getting old and just useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My body is not as good as before, it is really a crime to sleep until now...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Marshal Borg's explanation, everyone rolled their eyes collectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For ordinary people, the age of eighty is indeed a decline in health and dying years, but for a knight of the earth, he has just reached the middle of his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that everyone present has fallen into the ground, but the old marshal can still be alive and kicking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he was too old to lift a knife, Joseph II would not come to invite him out of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Marshal Borg wants to rely on the old to sell the old, and everyone can't say anything. Generally speaking, at his age it is indeed time to retire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this age, heirs have already been cultivated. Fame and fortune have also become a thing of the past, and in the remaining years, everyone is more willing to pursue the legendary sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even without the failure of the previous political struggle, Marshal Borg retired in recent years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he keeps dominating the position, then not only outsiders will have opinions, but even his own juniors will complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The old marshal just joked, your old man is getting stronger!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, I came here this time to apologize to you. Previously...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Joseph II could speak, Marshal Borg interrupted: \"Your Majesty, let him pass the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my life, I have seen all kinds of storms and waves. Some little things, I didn't take it to heart at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is difficult now, Your Majesty should put state affairs first, and there is no need to waste energy on me, an old man. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Marshal Borg's political wisdom is not really low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very clear what can be done and what can't be touched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like now, airs can be put on and postures can be controlled, but the king cannot publicly admit his mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal don't have to worry, right is right and wrong is wrong. Since I misunderstood Marshal by listening to slander, I should apologize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation in the kingdom is difficult, countless Li people are under the vanguard of the orcs, and a little carelessness will lead to the tragedy of the country's destruction and family destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the more than 20 million people in the Warhammer Kingdom, please let the Marshal put aside the previous suspicions and come out to turn the tide! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Joseph II also bowed to Marshal Borg, never giving him a chance to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, as a king, it is indeed a bit shameless to play like this, but the situation cannot allow Joseph II to delay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that the front line is a mess, and no matter who is replaced, there is no way to reverse the strength gap between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference lies in the way of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Marshal Borg, who has become famous and retired, there is no need to go to this muddy water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status and status have already reached the peak of the ministers, and they can't continue to improve after winning the battle. On the contrary, they will attract more fear from the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even worse if he lost the battle, and the damage to his reputation before and after his life would be the second most important thing. Maybe he might even confess himself on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-risk, no-reward trading, translocation, Joseph will definitely choose to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not playing moral kidnapping, he really doesn't know how to persuade Marshal Borg to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Warhammer Kingdom has always been full of talents. At this time of national crisis, it is time for young talents to stand out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the age of young people, why let me, an old man, stand in the way of everyone? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg struggled hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a former army commander, he has a deeper understanding of the military strength of the Warhammer Kingdom than Joseph II.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the military strength of the Warhammer Kingdom, once they become the main target of the orcs, their performance will not be much better than that of the Moxi Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in hard power cannot be made up by individual efforts. Even if he personally commanded the national army, it would only delay the defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No general likes a war where there is no hope of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally getting out of the political arena, he didn't want to trap himself in it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, although there are many young talents in the kingdom, it takes time to grow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this difficult moment, only you can **** them and turn the tide in…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Judgments based on self-cognition may not necessarily be accurate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Principality of Moxi must be saved!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is political or military, the Kingdom cannot sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the alliance relationship will deteriorate, and the next time the orcs will attack us, it will be difficult to ask for help from other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Principality of Moxi, which is caught in the middle, we are no longer bordering on the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the kingdom falls under the iron hooves of the orcs, it will not have much impact on them in the short term, and it is not a place that must be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the Alpha Kingdom to take the lead, the neighbors to the west are useless, and the Principality of Moxi can't take care of itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs turn around, we'll be alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Kingdom not only wants to rescue the Principality of Moxi, but also must follow the example of the Alpha Kingdom and send troops to rescue with great fanfare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not only for the Principality of Moxi, but also for the countries of the Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, we will also persuade the Principality of Moxi to counterattack and recover the Augustsburg defense line, reversing the current strategic passivity. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military, the more land the Principality of Mosi fell, the longer the exposed flank defense line of the Warhammer Kingdom would be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politically, it is more related to the survival of the Triple Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the 200,000 troops sent by the Alpha Kingdom are mostly just a bluff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the orc army has shifted its attack direction, the number of troops staying on their borders is still a huge number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Alpha Kingdom is stronger than us, they can deploy 200,000 troops at one time, which will still affect their mobilization system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think they can send out at most 100,000 reinforcements, plus the reinforcements from several other small countries, it is a miracle that they can gather 300,000 soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, the quality of these reinforcements is also very doubtful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standing army of the Alpha Kingdom could not be moved, so it could only send out the private army of the nobles. Several other small countries had just mobilized, and there might be some people using serfs to make up the numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the quality of these soldiers, it is okay to send them out to defend the city. It is hopeless to expect them to help regain the lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the kingdom is added, there is no chance of winning. Forcibly regaining the line of defense, ranging from heavy losses to annihilation of the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once another major defeat occurs, the countries will not be able to mobilize enough reinforcements in a short period of time. The Principality of Moxi, which was already in panic, was about to collapse completely. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Guy frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to rescue the Principality of Moxi, but it is another thing to help them recover their lost land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a strategic point of view, regaining the Augustsburg defense line will definitely benefit the Warhammer Kingdom without any harm. The only problem is that it can't be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, what we are going to discuss now is what is best for the kingdom, rather than asking you to worry about your allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of the overall situation, it is of course best to help the Principality of Moxi stabilize its defense line. But the loss that the kingdom needs to pay is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think the orc army, which is unable to make a breakthrough, will run to bite the hard bone of the Alpha Kingdom next, or will it turn the direction of attack and aim at us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the heavily invested northern defense line, the kingdom's preparations on the eastern front were severely lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossing Fort Augustus is the vast plain of Warhammer. Except for our unfinished steel defense line on the border, there are only sporadic noble castles left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it encounters the main attack of the orcs, it is only a matter of time before it falls. Without fortifications, if you want to stop the orc army in the wild, even if you mobilize the whole country's army, you can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want the kingdom to be turned into a wasteland, you can only sacrifice your allies. The orc army marched straight into the Principality of Moxi, which would indeed make us more passive strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But all of this will take time. They will not take the risk of launching a full-scale attack on us until the nails on the road are pulled out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this period, we can strengthen our defenses while exaggerating the strength of the orcs to the human countries that have not yet been involved, forcing them to make decisions in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the stimulation of the defeat on the front line, it is possible for the alliance meeting in July to make a decision in our favor and let all countries send troops in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the risks are also great. If a group of foreign races seized this opportunity to take action and restrain the reinforcements from various countries, it would be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is a small probability event. Even if they want to take advantage of the opportunity, all ethnic groups will choose to wait for the reinforcements to depart before jumping out to do things. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't want to pit his teammates. However, there is no way, if there is no problem in the Principality of Moxi, there will be a big problem in the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this plan is to drink poison to quench thirst, Marshal Borg has no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something is not done, it is impossible to block the attack of the orc army with the unfinished fortifications on the Eastern Front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Alpha Kingdom, which was experienced in beating and ready to be invaded at any time, the nobles occupied the dangerous land early, built castles and fortresses that could accommodate all the citizens, and stored enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom's preparations for this war were completely rushed into battle. According to prior estimates, they always believed that the orcs would not be able to invade with all their strength before the old Beamon Emperor died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Misjudged strategy, naturally need to pay for it. Based on the experience of gathering reinforcements from various countries to counterattack the orcs when participating in the war in the past, most of the nobles of the Warhammer Kingdom overestimated their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, there are still many small and medium nobles in the Warhammer Kingdom who are optimistic about this war. Naively think that as long as they are fully mobilized, the orcs can be driven back to their hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this state, let the orc army enter the hinterland of the kingdom, or it will really be beaten to nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was destroyed by the orcs. Even if the Human Race Alliance helped to recover the lost land afterwards, it would be difficult to revive the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Joseph II nodded helplessly. Deep down, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Marshal Borg was invited out, otherwise, according to the plan of the group of people, they foolishly took the thunder for the Principality of Moxi, and it would be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Principality of Moxi, after receiving the news that the Alpha Kingdom sent troops, King Chris IX breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this leading brother, the remaining problems will be easy to handle. The neighbors nearby have to contribute more or less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A family gathered tens of thousands of reinforcements, which added up to a large number. Even if they can't beat the main force of the orcs, at least they can help stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to reinforcements, what Moxi Principality needs most is \"confidence\". Resistance with reinforcements and fighting alone without reinforcements are completely two concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is a note from the Kingdom of Warhammer. They proposed to combine the strength of our two countries, plus reinforcements from various countries, to jointly recover Fort Augustus and restore the previous line of defense.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Foreign Minister Renato handed over a document.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking the document, he opened it and scanned the content. Chris IX fell into hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason given by the Warhammer Kingdom is very good. Fort Augustus has a difficult terrain and is the best place to build a line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the current defense line of Terence City is completely built by manpower. The so-called natural danger is just a small hill 180 meters high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are more continuous hills, forming a hilly terrain, it can also be used to make do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there are not many hills in this area. The real mountainous terrain is still in the southern area of ​​the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you retreat, you can't leave the foundation of the principality and go to the ravine to fight guerrillas with the orcs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if the land where the orc army passed was not white land, there were not many living people. It is also very difficult to swim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After closing the document, Chris IX asked slowly: \"What do you think of the Warhammer Kingdom's proposal?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is really tempted this time. The pancake drawn by Warhammer Kingdom is really too tempting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Augustsburg defense line is recovered, everything will return to pre-war. The Principality of Moxi, which is on the verge of subjugation, will be resurrected with full blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even because of the war, they can passively train an army with good combat effectiveness. In the next fight against the orc invasion, it will increase the odds of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, from a strategic point of view, regaining the Augustsburg defense line is indeed the best choice. The only two problems are:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politically, whether it will affect the alliance meeting in July; militaryly, whether the troops can really complete the combat mission as expected. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plans are good, but in the end they have to be implemented by people. The orc army is constantly coming, and it is not easy to regain Fort Augustus from them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the initiative to attack leads to a big defeat on the front line, from the side that regained the lost ground to the side that fled in a hurry, it will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the Terran Alliance meeting in July is not that important. According to past practice, the alliance will be able to shake the sky when encountering any matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending troops to reinforce such a big matter, if you don't make a fuss for a while, you won't be able to enter the voting process at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this opportunity is rare. With the cooperation of the Warhammer Kingdom and the gathering of reinforcements from all over the world, this is the best opportunity for us to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you talk about the orc army in the Alpha Kingdom to contain the front line, the probability of success will be even higher. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military Minister Martins said cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Opportunity\" is just a matter of probability, and it does not mean that it will definitely be realized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is ever-changing, and in the final analysis it still depends on strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, many issues are not just simple military issues, but also include a series of political issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line keeps losing cities and land, and the pressure on the military is also increasing day by day. Domestic calls for the replacement of Martins are getting louder and louder. If he doesn't make any achievements, he will leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knew there were risks involved, Martins could only bite the bullet and take a gamble. For him personally, everything is easy to say if he wins, and it won't be much worse than it is now if he loses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the north hesitantly, Chris IX asked solemnly: \"If we join hands with the Warhammer Kingdom, how high is the probability of successfully recovering the defense line of Fort Augustus?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County, after a series of preparations, the expeditionary force ushered in the day of assembly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the team of large and small bags, Hudson very much suspected that this was a team going to the market, not an army going out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People leave their hometowns and are humble. It takes two thousand miles to travel, and it is impossible to fight in a foreign country without being fully prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other daily supplies can be provided by the Principality of Moxi. Clothes and quilts for all seasons must be prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being distrustful of the logistical capabilities of their allies, the aristocrats seldom collectively bleed for a while, and bought outfits for all the soldiers participating in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fifteen thousand soldiers is not much more, counting people and animals together, the total force will break through 20,000 directly, just waiting for the kingdom to send someone to check and accept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patrolling the neatly arranged team, a sense of pride welled up in Hudson's chest. Seeing this majestic momentum, it is not in vain for him to work hard for so long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble officers who were in charge of counting the number of people on the side were startled by the momentum displayed by the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are ignorant, it's that the soldiers in Wrightshire showed a surprising morale. There is no shortage of elite reinforcements in other regions, but when they hear that they are going to fight the orcs, they all look like their parents are dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the exception of the Wrightshire soldiers, apart from complaining about the long distance, they didn't pay much attention to the orc army they were about to face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a faint arrogance of dismissiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this spirit was deliberately cultivated by Hudson. When they were trained in the Mountain Territory earlier, these people were sent out in batches to supervise the work of the orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For soldiers who have brandished whips and supervised the work of orc slaves, it is easy to have a psychological advantage: orcs are nothing more than that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The subtle implantation of psychological hints gave everyone a sense of superiority over orcs. So much so that when it comes to going out to fight the orcs, everyone has a deep contempt in their bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of mentality made the morale of the expeditionary army far surpass the reinforcements sent by neighboring provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, your military training ability is really amazing! Even if you look at the entire continent, it is one of the best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps you should take on heavier responsibilities, for example: Serve as the chief instructor of the kingdom's army, and train an elite team for the kingdom to rival! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged officer is not talking nonsense, he is really going to recommend it to the king. In the face of a national crisis, anything that can enhance the military strength of the kingdom is very meaningful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that my family knows my own affairs. The training of Wrightshire soldiers seems to be replicable, but in fact it is very difficult to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not that the Alpha Kingdom does not have orc slaves, but there is really no other company that uses orc slaves on such a large scale as the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This alone blocks the way for large-scale imitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the rest of the queue training, it is only effective in improving the discipline and momentum of the recruits, and the old fritters are not interested in these.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is really responsible for training the national army, the problems of these people will soon be exposed. Coupled with not enough military instructors, blind reforms will only make things worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Jose joked, commanding the team in front of me has already exhausted me. How can I take on the heavy responsibility of training the national army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, it's okay to try military reforms. But now is the time of war, and every move will be magnified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of carrying out reforms with unknown prospects, it is better to maintain the status quo and wait until the end of the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all true words, and it is really not suitable for military reform during wartime. As for after the war is over, the battle is over, so why reform?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a traditionally conservative country, the Alpha Kingdom itself is not suitable for radical reforms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The basic national conditions of the princes everywhere determine that any reform is difficult to replicate across the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seems to have thought of this, Earl Jose, who was originally in high spirits, nodded helplessly, not to continue entanglement on this sensitive topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It was already the end of the month when the reinforcements from Wright County officially set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even at this speed, Hudson was verbally commended by the King's special envoy. Compared with the colleagues who are still wrangling, this is already a rare high efficiency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprise, Hudson's Wright County Corps became the first team to go to the rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political-related things, as long as they touch the first place, they will become unusual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passively out of the limelight, Hudson is also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who knew colleagues were so resistant?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you know you can't escape, you're still wasting time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rescue is not about going as late as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the army of the Principality of Moxi collapsed, the reinforcements from the Alpha Kingdom would not be enough to fill the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Colleagues are not good enough, and this achievement falls directly on Hudson's head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there is no more, except for a little prestige, Mao has not seen any substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has a very clear position on its own army - \"aid\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, it is to play an auxiliary role on the battlefield, perform some tasks of defending the city, or fight orcs and miscellaneous fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a decisive battle with the main force of the orcs, even the most optimistic boss in the capital did not dare to have such illusions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Divided geographically, there are seven provinces in the southeastern region of the Alpha Kingdom. Fengyun Province is still fighting on the front line, so this reinforcement task will naturally not fall on their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining six provinces in southeast China nominally dispatched troops from one county to join the war. When it comes to specific operations, there are many problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some small counties simply can't afford 15,000 elites, and the shortfall can only be shared by other counties in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some provinces had too much internal quarrel, and no one was willing to take on this kind of hard work, and in the end they had to be shared among the counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most typical feature of a cobbled together army is confusion in command. The temporarily appointed head of the legion has limited deterrent effect on nobles from all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson led the Wright County Legion to set off for more than ten days, and there were reinforcements from two provinces, but he did not understand the internal relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are people along the way to provide logistics, there is no pressure on the luggage, and you only need to be responsible for the journey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marching speed was naturally a little faster than usual, and Hudson led the troops forward sixty miles on the first day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then the speed naturally slowed down. The performance on the first day was excellent, that's because the king's special envoy came to follow the troops, and the euphemistic name was to see him off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to perform in front of the leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fear of overperformance and a bad ending later, it wouldn't be a problem to walk another twenty or thirty miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is a safe and secure march on the homeland, and soldiers are not required to ensure combat effectiveness at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even burying pots to make food and setting up camps, there are people who do it for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at the mobilization and coordination abilities of nobles from all over the country, it is absolutely a miracle that they appeared in the semi-slave and semi-feudal era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the only one who has this ability to cooperate is the Alpha Kingdom family. In other countries on the mainland, the nobles and gentlemen along the way would not be so cooperative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the credits of the orc empire. It is thanks to the efforts of the orc army for hundreds of years that everyone's ability to cooperate has been trained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles along the way will do their best to cooperate, and the nobles participating in the war will also strictly restrain military discipline. Everyone has formed a tacit understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, looking at the information gathered in his hands, Caesar III was furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are reinforcements, but the performance of the \"200,000\" army is really hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the Wright County Army led by Hudson, who set off on time within the specified time, all the remaining reinforcements went wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons are varied, but the end result is the same. In order to urge reinforcements from all walks of life to set off, Earl Jose, who was in charge of coordinating the deployment, could only sue the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is a hard job to go out to support the Principality of Moxi. It is very normal for the people below to have resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, the number of troops we had rigidly stipulated was also difficult for the provinces to implement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Jose's prestige is not enough. Before that, the nobles from all over the world had never heard of his name. It is normal that they cannot deter the arrogant soldiers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to replace it with a nobleman with high prestige and go to the army to serve as the commander of the coalition forces. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the prime minister, he is very clear about the difficulties faced by the local government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slowness of action is mainly due to two aspects: the resistance of the nobles responsible for carrying out the task, and the confusion in the command of the assembled team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the latter has a greater impact. Compared with the cobbled together teams, the teams that directly use the county as a unit and complete the deployment of troops perform much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more complex the team, the higher the requirements for the commander. Theoretically speaking, there is no problem in sending an earl to command the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regrettably, Earl Jose is the earl of the court conferred by the king. The reputation is quite high, but if you want to command a complex coalition army, it is far from enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the king's face, give this \"king's special envoy\" some face, it is estimated that the people below will not treat him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to save face, but another to do it. The commander of the empty earl, even if he wanted to show his prestige, he didn't have the ability to kill chickens and monkeys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Caesar III said unhappily: \"The orcs have always been scheming, the front line has been in danger for a long time, and it is not suitable for the important generals of the kingdom to leave at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The famous nobles all have their own affairs, and they can't get away even if they think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, let little Caesar go through it. Just let him take the opportunity to see the world and exercise his military command ability. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince was about to go to the battlefield to exercise, and everyone tacitly chose to shut up on this issue. Sensible politicians know that it is better not to mix this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, it is common for the king to go to the battlefield. It is not surprising that the crown prince goes to the front line to \"gild\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the time to go to the Principality of Moxi, after all, it is full of uncertainties. Although the Principality of Moxi did not dare to cause an accident to Crown Prince Caesar, the problem is that the orcs dare!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is full of various uncertainties. If something happens to the crown prince, whoever chooses to support him at this time will become the target of anger afterwards?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    objected, let alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doubting the ability of the crown prince will not only offend the current king, but also offend the next king. There is no \"bright\" future for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are other nobles who can carry out this task in the past, there can only be none now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sudden transfer of high-level personnel, Hudson, who received the news, decisively ordered to his subordinates: \"Send the order, and the next marching speed will drop to 20 miles per day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom, send a message to the officer in charge of coordinating supplies. The reason is: the speed of reinforcements in the counties is too slow, we have to wait for them to catch up and act together. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traveling 20 miles a day, only one morning is enough, and it is safe to be passive and sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who let Earl Jose's title of commander-in-chief be revoked suddenly by the king?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The audience is gone, and you are still so active, who will show it to you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the officialdom, it is not enough to perform well, but also to keep abreast of the trends above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose needs everyone to arrive in the Principality of Moxi as soon as possible, which does not mean that the next commander of the coalition forces thinks so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the new commander, who is also the top second generation of the kingdom—the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first time Hudson received this news, he thought someone was joking with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a dangerous mission, let the crown prince lead the team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Earl Jose is unqualified, he can be replaced by a prestigious nobleman. If it really doesn't work, it's okay to send a member of the close royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking of the traditions of the continent of Aslante, Hudson dismissed his original idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their reinforcements used to be full of dangers, but the crown prince was gilded in the past, but it was the safest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the people of the Principality of Moxi to let Crown Prince Caesar go to the front line. Fishing in troubled waters is much easier than gold-plating in China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the country, if the crown prince wants to gain military exploits, he must at least go to the front line to participate in the command, not to mention personally going into battle to kill the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of a big defeat, maybe the crown prince will also lose it. In the history of the Alpha Kingdom, more than one king died in battle, and even more princes died on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III had only one son. Naturally, he could not participate in such high-risk gilding activities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if he wanted to secure the throne, he didn't have any military achievements, so he would have no confidence in facing the big nobles in the country in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this joint-stock kingdom, the king is only a major shareholder. If his own prestige is not enough, it is easy for the minority shareholders to control the management and rob the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This rescue operation is undoubtedly a good opportunity. You only need to sit in the rear to coordinate. If there is a victory on the front line, the crown prince will have a share of the credit; if there is a defeat, someone will take the initiative to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no interest in fighting with this second generation. He just shares his military achievements, and he is most afraid of commanding blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for hugging the thigh, for a nobleman whose status has reached his level, as long as he doesn't want to go to the central government to develop, it doesn't make any sense to please the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stronger than Caesar III, who has been in power for ten years and has not supported a new great noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has limited resources, which belongs to the typical \"one radish, one pit\" model. Unless a big family declines, no one can try to rise against the trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually nest in their own fief and farm, live an ordinary life without disputes with others, and it is a waste of time to please the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that he is being cautious and cautious now is because he doesn't want to offend others, so as not to become the target of being established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marching speed slowed down, and Hudson also had time to pay close attention to marching discipline. With the efforts of a group of noble officers, the team became more and more orderly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The almost uniform pace, 15,000 people walked together, the momentum alone is far from scary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the faces of the nobles along the way, you can tell that everyone is overwhelmed by this military appearance. \"Elite\", this is definitely an elite division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Advance like a snail all the way, and the military exploits have not yet been obtained, but Hudson's name has resounded through half of the Alpha Kingdom first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the scorching sun, Hudson had just ordered to rest on the spot when a group of Griffon cavalry appeared above the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the sky from a distance, Hudson just ignored it. A similar scene happened more than once along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an extra army in transit within the sphere of influence of the family, so it is also appropriate to send Griffin cavalry over to investigate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the clouds, a monster eagle with golden feathers and sharp eyes exuding light is particularly eye-catching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the eagle's back, sat a gorgeously dressed young man, looking down at the earth at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's better to meet people than to be famous. I didn't expect that the noble private army in Wright County is really an elite army. It seems that this mission has become more and more interesting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said slightly excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the first time to lead troops to go out, everything should be stable. It is better to lead an elite army into battle than to lead a mob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, don't take it lightly. Among the reinforcements sent by the Kingdom this time, the Wrightshire Army led by Viscount Hudson is worthy of use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the other five legions is really hard to describe. Once you have seen it, you will find that this task is not easy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Jose, who was riding a griffin, hurriedly persuaded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The position of the coach was not obtained, but the position of the deputy coach did fall on his head. Now his main task is no longer to lead troops to fight, but to take care of the young crown prince in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young people have the problem of pretentiousness, and the more noble they are, the more serious their performance in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose didn't want his crown prince to misjudge the strength of the coalition forces, treat all the expeditionary forces as elites, and go to take on some tasks that were beyond the capacity of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, I'm going to see how bad those legions are!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can make His Excellency Earl so fresh in his memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now, let's go and see this interesting Viscount Hudson first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to train such an elite army, it can be seen that his training ability is the top wave in the entire kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Crown Prince Caesar had already operated the eagle and began to land slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crowd hurriedly followed, and the soldiers with quick eyes and quick hands even took off the big flag on their backs and signaled, lest they be mistaken for the enemy by the soldiers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he landed, Earl Jose, who had been in the army, was recognized by a nearby noble officer, and hurried forward to greet him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Honorable Earl Jose, welcome. The legion commander will be here soon. Please enter the camp for a short rest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the noble officers were unaware of the changes in the high-level personnel, and mistakenly thought that Earl Jose was still the commander of the coalition forces, and directly gave the highest courtesy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lord was ignored, and the dissatisfaction of Crown Prince Caesar arose spontaneously. It's just that his natural acting skills made him used to not being happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the fleeting look of displeasure between his brows was caught by the old and spicy Earl Jose, and the noble officer who rushed forward to greet him introduced:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the new commander-in-chief of the coalition forces—Crown Prince Caesar. Hudson's Army Commander is here to greet you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is clear that he wants to put the camp here and is not going to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that performing too well is also a sin. As the only unit in the expeditionary force that seems to have combat effectiveness, it will naturally attract more attention from above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inconvenient to do anything with an extra boss watching. For example: the marching speed that has just been reduced must be restored again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the armed parade of twenty miles a day, it has evolved to the elite standard of sixty miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, for these soldiers, since the Kingdom ordered mobilization half a year ago, the food standard has been improved. The current physical fitness is sufficient for this kind of high-intensity march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the arrival of the crown prince, the morale was further boosted, and the performance along the way was remarkable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people below were excited, but Hudson was not happy. The arrival of Crown Prince Caesar, seemingly without affecting him, has actually weakened his control over the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little nobles under his command heard that His Royal Highness was coming, and they were all excited like a festival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the strict internal hierarchy of the nobles, which restrained their behavior, I'm afraid these guys couldn't help but lean over and show off in front of the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Legion Commander, Your Highness the Crown Prince welcomes you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the guard made Hudson frown. Others hold banquets every now and then at most, but he accepts invitations every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The content of the discussion is also varied, sometimes it is to discuss the situation of the kingdom, sometimes it is to discuss the next marching route and combat deployment, and sometimes it is purely listening to His Royal Highness the crown prince...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, Hudson suffers from the role of the listener. It's not that he deliberately hides his clumsiness, it's really the question raised by Crown Prince Caesar, which is very sensitive every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As His Royal Highness the crown prince, he already belongs to the top dignitaries in the mainland. It doesn't matter what situation he comments on or what radical views he expresses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson can't. His status determines that he cannot intervene too much in sensitive issues, let alone express his position easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can only cope with the wooing of Crown Prince Caesar. Although this is the only legal son of the king, he is not a king after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he does become king, Hudson will not easily go to the past. Caesar III is strong, because his political skills are strong enough, and his actions are generous enough to be convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because the father is powerful does not mean that the son must be good. Most of the time, if there is a strong father, there is a high probability that the son will be raised and abandoned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the Crown Prince Caesar has been adopted or not is still unclear for the time being, but the desire to make contributions and surpass his own father has been shown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A crown prince who wants to do business is destined not to be liked by the nobles. Being suppressed by Caesar III for so long, no one wants to be suppressed forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Crown Prince Caesar takes office, there will inevitably be a wave of rebounding competition for the right to speak politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does not want to get involved in this level of game. In case of standing on the wrong team, the future will be hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I'll go there right away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it was the crown prince who invited him. After speaking, Hudson dropped the things in his hands and walked out of his tent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the difficulties faced by the reinforcements from all walks of life are different. Without a deep understanding, it is difficult to find the key to the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It might be difficult for them to catch up. It is better to let the provinces conduct self-examination, find out where the problem is, and solve the problem of slow action as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another day of discussions surrounding the slowness of colleagues. The smooth Hudson naturally wouldn't say anything that would spoil the scenery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the provinces conduct self-examination, which is obviously just a show. If the problem can be solved, the matter will not be delayed until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what the crown prince requested, let the reinforcements from all walks of life catch up as soon as possible, unless the Wrightshire Army slows down and waits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, at the current speed of sixty miles a day, he would run wildly in front, and unless the people behind him fly, it would be impossible to catch up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is difficult, why don't those guys know how to take care of the overall situation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is as dedicated and conscientious as Viscount Hudson, why don't you worry about the orcs' injustice!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended not to hear the crown prince's indignant complaints. He would not do such a thing that offended people for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, judging from the public information from the government, the performance of colleagues from all walks of life is already very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All reinforcements have set off. Even the team with the slowest marching speed has reached forty miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For an improvised team, being able to reach this speed obviously gave Caesar, the crown prince, face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traveling sixty miles a day like the Wrightshire Legion is already the performance of the kingdom's elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, an army composed of pure practitioners does not count.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standard equipment for those guys is to start at eighty miles a day. If there is no logistical drag, it is no problem to travel hundreds of miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps feeling that Crown Prince Caesar was acting a little out of character, Count Jose on the side changed the topic and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the special envoy of the Principality of Moxi will join us soon, do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the \"Principality of Moxi\", Crown Prince Caesar, who was still complaining, instantly regained his spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Now is the time of war, and the reception work can be kept simple. It is estimated that the special envoy of the Principality of Moxi will not mind these details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't know enough about the frontline situation of the Principality of Moxi. If we rush to the battlefield, we will suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to rest in the Principality of Moxi for a period of time, and take the next step after the reinforcements from various countries gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things must be explained clearly to them first. It would be bad to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings from time to time and affect the diplomatic relations between the two countries. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar's words made Hudson's eyes shine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at this \"handling\" skills, you can know that the crown prince in front of you is still politically minded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is eager to make contributions, he has not forgotten his position. As reinforcements, they were just helping out in the past, not going to stand up for mines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For wars within the scope of ability, it is natural to help. Things beyond one's own ability should be shirked or have to be shirked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clarify the topic in advance, and vaccinate the Principality of Moxi, so as to avoid random assignment of tasks and make everyone unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi, after the initial joy, the deteriorating situation on the front line quickly brought Chris IX back to reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the original Yingren Imperial Court, the armies of the other four major imperial courts also appeared in the Principality of Moxi, and the assembled orc army exceeded 600,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge military pressure, the most direct response is the urgent letter from the front, one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counterattack plan is out of the question for now, the most important thing now is to take care of the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When will reinforcements arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi has already started full-scale mobilization, and the reserve team prepared earlier has also been dispatched to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, it barely blocked the enemy's front. As time goes by, the defensive pressure is also increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying solely on the strength of the Principality of Moxi, there is almost no hope to stop the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already communicated with various countries. The Alpha Kingdom's reinforcements are the fastest, and the 20,000 elite vanguard troops have already arrived at the border area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The follow-up troops are also on the way, but the marching speed is slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively seeking for Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all goes well, we will welcome the first support army in ten days. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato replied slightly embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has really tried its best, but it will take time for the reinforcements to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan has never changed quickly. Originally, it was thought that the Alpha Kingdom would send reinforcements nearby, but in the end they called in troops from the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't say anything, but in actual actions, the Alpha Kingdom has already shown that they are not optimistic about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the border areas, the continuous fortifications are constantly rising, which is clearly preparing for the fall of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it. Renato must not say this kind of thing, otherwise the hearts of the people in the country will be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the performance of the Alpha Kingdom is disappointing, but the performance of the neighbors around is also unsatisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements were indeed sent out, but the quality is hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information collected by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among all the currently known reinforcements, only the \"Wrightshire Army\" can be called an elite division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adhering to the principle of reporting good news and not bad news, Renato can only choose good content to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the bad things can be reported to the king in private, there is no need for the whole world to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to urge you again and tell the nobles who came to the rescue that as long as they make great contributions in the defense of the Principality of Moxi, we will reward you heavily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold, silver, jewellery, fine clothes, fine food, beauties and titles are all available, even if it is a fiefdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are all realistic, and it is impossible to ask everyone to work hard without giving some benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are imitating the Alpha Kingdom. Every time the war ends, a large number of foreign nobles will receive rewards among the reinforcements from various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally there are foreign nobles who take root in the Alpha Kingdom and open another branch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are things of the past. A country that is often beaten is not so attractive to nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the fiefdoms, they are basically on the front line. If you want to keep your own fiefdom, you must fight the orcs desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the nobles who got the fief fell on the battlefield under the baptism of the orc army round after round.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many failure cases, and the great nobles of various countries have gradually given up the idea of ​​​​opening a branch in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land that was awarded as a reward, after several turnovers, finally returned to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are ready-made cases, and Chris IX will naturally follow suit. Although the success rate of fooling people is not high, there is no harm in trying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the war has progressed until now, and there have been many unclaimed lands in the Principality of Moxi. If this fight continues, there will only be more unowned land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem in fulfilling the fief promise after the war. On the contrary, it is the finances within gold, silver and jewelry that are really difficult to cash out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom, watching the orc army continue to test its borders, Joseph II was very angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was clearly agreed that everyone would join forces to counterattack, but they were ready to take action, and the Principality of Moxi lost the chain directly, and had to wait for reinforcements from various countries to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from neighboring countries did not wait, but the reinforcements from the orcs arrived first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the orcs' strength is still far from enough for the battle to destroy the country, it has also brought great pressure to the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to irritate the orcs, Joseph II even ordered the front-line troops to prohibit provocations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a military point of view, this is a very funny order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two countries have been at war for half a year, and the word \"provocation\" is still used, which is really ridiculous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the Kingdom of Warhammer is not the opponent of the orc army. Once the orcs are angered, they will be in danger of destroying the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Terran Alliance meeting is about to start. Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have a strategy to persuade the nations of the Terran to send reinforcements as soon as possible?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the efficiency of a few neighbors in rescuing the Principality of Moxi, we know that it will definitely take a long time for the entire Human Race Alliance to act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refer to the alliance meetings in history, the short one lasts for one or two months, and the long one directly wrangles for three to five years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, it is now sitting in the world. If it was played like this when fighting the world, it is estimated that the human race would have been cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just holding a meeting can be delayed so much, but the efficiency of specific execution is even less to be expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All parties reached an agreement within half a year and sent reinforcements within a year. This was the highest efficiency of the alliance when the Alpha Kingdom asked for help in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, it will take more than two years before the reinforcements from various countries will arrive one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is certainly a factor of long distances, but there are too many intertwined interest entanglements, which are difficult to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has coordinated the relationship between the eleven countries, and we will make a joint proposal at the alliance meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha said that they are very confident in persuading the Kingdom of Frank to support the proposal, but the trouble is that the Holy See may make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, we have reached an agreement with 11 countries with relevant interests, and we will form a public relations team together to win the support of as many countries as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cassidy said exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is definitely the busiest department in the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to push the Terran Alliance to send troops, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tried its best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eleven-nation joint proposal, that is, the name sounds good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the Alpha Kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom, and the Principality of Moxi, the words of the three kingdoms have some weight, and the rest of the small countries follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with someone waving the flag and shouting, but it is a pity that the people who are persuaded are the neighbors of the three countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is willing to participate, mainly because they are worried that if something goes wrong in the Three Kingdoms, the flames of war will burn on their own heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's the Holy See again, can't they do some personnel work!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of all the qualified kings, none of them liked the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, hundreds of years ago, everyone worked together to force the Holy See back to their hometown, and no one wanted to return to the hundreds of years of white terror.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he didn't feel like complaining enough to relieve his anger, Joseph II added: “If the Holy See dares to make trouble on the issue of sending troops, support the proposal of the Franks and bring down the face of the Holy See!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It was rumored among the people that the orc invasion was revenge for the Alpha Kingdom after it offended the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the current public opinion is very unfavorable to the Holy See, and the people who eat melons are overwhelmed. There are more melons about the Holy See in the past year than in the past few decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more and more crimes, and Pius VII is too lazy to explain. The main reason is that there are too many loopholes left, which simply cannot withstand scrutiny. The more explanations are made, the more problems will be exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Sauron, how far has the public relations for various countries come? How many supporters do we have now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing topic. Kingship and theocracy are inherently opposite. Even some countries that usually have a good relationship with the Holy See don't want to see the Holy See's hand getting longer and longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the current situation is a bit delicate. Although we have won the support of some countries, most of them are of little weight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Frankish opponent, the Kingdom of Libya, was very cautious on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe our previous actions were too big, which aroused bad associations, so...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the pope's expression was wrong, Bishop Sauron swallowed the words again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Admitting that you were wrong is far more difficult than making excuses. Even if everyone knows that the bad situation that is unfavorable to the Holy See is all caused by their previous efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, the support of some small countries is enough. The north is fighting in the dark, the orc army has just made a breakthrough, and other alien races are starting to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, the Franks' attack on us was only a lot of thunder and little rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we deny all their accusations, things will pass quickly. At most, it will lose a little reputation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be an understatement, but in fact it is deeply helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Successive popes have done this, but during his tenure, they were detonated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, they encountered a difficult leader, which ignited the fuse of the conflict; on the other hand, after the expansion of the Holy See, the expenses continued to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All countries reacted fiercely, most of them were stimulated by the big movement of the Holy See, awakening the horrible memories sleeping in everyone's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the military expansion hadn't stimulated everyone's sensitive nerves, the countries would not have followed up so quickly if the Franks shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the northern orc army is raging. The Alpha Kingdom can still support it, but the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Warhammer are already in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Principality of Moxi, if there is no external assistance, it is still unknown whether it can survive this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the conflict between us and the Frankish Kingdom, another major theme at the Human Race Alliance meeting must be sending troops to support the three northern countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against alien races is the basis for the establishment of the Human Race Alliance. According to past practice, the proposal to send troops to support the northern front is bound to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are deeply infamous for colluding with the orcs. If it is just a show like before, I am afraid that we will not be able to explain it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake tried hard to show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The return of the Blood Moon Horn allowed him, the crumbling head of the Knights of Judgment, to temporarily avoid disaster, but his position was still unstable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more this is the case, the more results must be made. Otherwise, he would be driven home by his enemies sooner or later. After all, the Holy See paid a high price to get back the Horn of the Blood Moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the charge of colluding with the orcs, and it is also related to the Judgment Knights. Although he was following orders, the Pope couldn't be blamed for this kind of thing, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII frowned more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the status of the Holy See in the human race is very embarrassing. Nominally possessing supreme power, he is the leader of the religious world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, their religious leaders have long been reduced to rubber stamps. Most of the time, it is used to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he, the Pope, issues orders, whether they can be carried out depends on everyone's mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the trouble has reached this point, even the position of the nominal religious leader may be lost if he is a little careless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm afraid we have to participate in this support operation. However, it is better to delay the time as much as possible, preferably until the situation in the north is corrupt.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king of political struggle, Pius VII is very aware of the Holy See, which is deep in the vortex of public opinion, and it is difficult to get out now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to make a big news to attract the attention of the outside world and downplay the existence of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even more perfect if he could get some credit for fighting against aliens and use it for publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, as the venue for this Terran Alliance meeting, is already busy preparing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous Terran Alliance meetings, many representatives participated. Not only countries will send delegations, but also a large number of nobles and powerful groups will also send people to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred and sixty-five members of parliament, representing the highest authority of the entire Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dynasty change occurs, the rise and fall of power changes, and the number of members of parliament also shifts. The only thing that remains unchanged is the total number of members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A faction has multiple seats, as long as its own strength matches, it is also legal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, a seat in a parliament not only represents power, but also an obligation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When fighting against alien races, tasks are assigned based on seats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the feudal nobles, mage associations, alchemy associations... all have their own seats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A country's right to speak in the parliament can be roughly inferred by counting the number of representatives from the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most powerful country of the human race, the Frankish Kingdom naturally has the second most seats, and the Holy See has the most seats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the gap between the two sides is not that big, coupled with the embarrassing position of the Holy See in the alliance, the Frankish Kingdom has the most say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the ruler of the kingdom, Charles III is looking down at the four directions in high spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has the capital of arrogance, even the Holy See, which was once powerful, is now unable to step down by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is a proposal prepared by the eleven northern countries, and they hope to gain our support.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the Minister of Foreign Affairs had already handed the documents to Charles III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the document, Charles III didn't intend to read it at all, and asked casually: \"How far has the situation in the north reached?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the Alpha Kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom, and the Principality of Moxi combined have not lasted as long as the Alpha Kingdom in the past? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having more allies and sharing the pressure together, life will naturally be easier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But having many allies does not mean that the alliance can last longer under the iron heel of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III seemed to be asking, but he was actually mocking himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to matters of life and death, the three northern countries are able to intrigue, which really makes him look down on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the most dangerous thing now is the Principality of Moxi. They underestimated the madness of the orcs too much, and the preparations before the battle were not sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fall of Fort Augustus, the most important line of defense, put the Principality of Mosi and the Kingdom of Warhammer into strategic passiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Principality of Moxi, they are now gritted their teeth to support. Although several neighbors expressed that they would send troops to rescue, there is no support soldier in place yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, Alpha Kingdom's performance is much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the fact that they suffered a lot in the early days of the war and almost ruined the army of a province; overall, the performance was good. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jesus replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crisis belongs to other countries. The Frankish kingdom deep in the western continent cannot feel the threat of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how bad the situation is, he still believes that the Frankish Kingdom has the ability to turn the tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is the era of the human race, and the orcs can only be regarded as minor troubles. Unless all the alien races attack together, the human race can suppress the orcs with only one hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Last night, I received a letter from Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his letter, he made a promise that as long as we push all countries to send troops and severely damage the Orc Empire during the war, they will persuade the northern countries to join our new Holy See plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What do you think? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Establishing a separate Holy See is his long-planned plan. It's just that the involvement is too big, and the nations of the human race are also arguing endlessly on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to attract countries to join, the Frankish Kingdom has also made many efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, everyone is not stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See is indeed hateful, if possible, everyone would not mind stepping them into the abyss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is, is the new Holy See led by the Kingdom of Franks a friendly one?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Vatican is a rubber stamp, as long as you ignore them, at most it will occasionally disgust people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unknown new Holy See, plus the support of the Frankish Kingdom, who knows what will happen next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are always full of fear of uncertain things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough supporters, Charles III's plan was forced to shelve. He could only discredit the Holy See first, and then slowly plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the opportunity has come. If you get the support of the northern countries, plus Frank's own younger brother, the foundation for the establishment of the new Holy See will be ready.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few more countries are tricked into participating, it will almost change the color of the human race countries in half the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See wants to form a conquest army, I am afraid that the remaining countries will just deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are aliens watching outside, and no one dares to provoke a large-scale civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Caesar III's promise should be reliable. The Alpha Kingdom and the Holy See also have deep grievances. If there is a chance to bring down the Holy See, it is not surprising that they are involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that they promised to persuade the northern countries to join together. Whether it can be fulfilled is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing is a good thing for the kingdom after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Success or failure, it never hurts to try. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Bergson responded with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot win over the northern countries, but it can also win over the Alpha Kingdom. On the issue of confronting the Holy See, no one would dislike many allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fluttering flag tells of the hardships of marching thousands of miles in the heat of summer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossing the boundary line, Hudson always felt a sense of loss and uneasiness in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting in a foreign country, it is impossible not to be vigilant at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the griffin cavalry brought by Crown Prince Caesar played a role in the investigation, which reassured Hudson a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also refused the invitation of the nobles along the way, leaving the barracks as little as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These small episodes did not cause the slightest disturbance. The guest of honor for the banquet is Crown Prince Caesar, not him, the little Viscount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to send an invitation card is all for saving face. If you don't participate in the banquet, there are really not many with him, and there are not many without him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the premise that the name of the \"Wright County Legion Elite\" has spread far and wide, otherwise people would not even know who Hudson is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the ease with which Crown Prince Caesar walked among the various nobles, Hudson was envious for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of ability cannot be learned just by thinking about it. It is difficult to do this without extraordinary communication talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is to cast a good tire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As your status improves, someone will help you explain everything you say and do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Be polite, that is aristocratic temperament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wild and uninhibited, that is full of arrogance and informality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, every word and deed of the big man is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find a problem, it must be your own problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar might as well go out to attend more banquets, so that the marching speed can be reduced reasonably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson's wishful thinking did not work after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within a few days, all the posts on the banquet disappeared, and even fewer nobles came to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little brainstorming, he knew that it wasn't that Crown Prince Caesar was losing face, it was more likely that the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi intervened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is still waiting for help, and the rear is dragging its feet by eating and drinking, what is this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the beatings of the orcs were not enough. If the Principality of Moxi was beaten a few more times, it would be better if the country was almost destroyed and the family would be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the nobles in the Alpha Kingdom, you can tell that even though the nobles along the way know that Crown Prince Caesar is in the army, at most everyone will come out to take a photo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hosting a high-profile banquet reception does not exist. Whoever dares to violate this unspoken rule will immediately receive a call-up order from the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frugality was practiced during the war, and there were few banquets except for the celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when Crown Prince Caesar left the capital to serve in the army, there was no farewell banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tense atmosphere soon affected the mood of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is a young man in his early twenties, and he has not yet cultivated the iron face of an old fox, which can cover up all emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine outside, but something must be going on inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar, who had nowhere to release his energy, quickly vented his anger on the next few teams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take a few guards, get on the mount and go to the rear camps to inspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What exactly happened, Hudson didn't know, anyway, Crown Prince Caesar's face was very ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to get together to find scolding, but Hudson still couldn't escape the trouble after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the background of his colleagues, as the commander of the only \"elite army\", Hudson's status has also risen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All major military meetings have never been absent. Most of the time, you will be asked for advice. …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tomorrow we will arrive at the capital of the Principality of Moxi, and now we are only two hundred miles away from the front line. What plans does Viscount Hudson have?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the crown prince's question, Hudson secretly complained. This is to use him as a counselor, or to just work without getting paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to shirk, and it involves the next task assignment, so we have to find a way to fight for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the Moxi Principality is in an emergency situation, and it is very likely that we will be transferred to the front line soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Wrightshire Army has just arrived and has not yet adapted to the local climate and environment. Going to the battlefield rashly can easily cause terrorist consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My personal suggestion is to rest in the Principality of Moxi for a period of time, and then participate in this war after the reinforcements from all walks of life gather. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to say that the water and soil were unacceptable, but this is an era of magic technology, and a bottle of potion will take whatever is not acceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether there will be sequelae, it is hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply changed to a more illusory rhetoric, directly implying that Crown Prince Caesar did not want to go to the battlefield yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the Principality of Moxi, not my own territory. There is no reason to sacrifice your own strength for the benefit of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Viscount, I will raise these issues. No matter how the situation in the Principality of Moxi develops, the Wright County Army will not go to the battlefield in a short time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar promised proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elites are different from cannon fodder. If such an army is wiped out in the Principality of Moxi without achieving a brilliant record, the crown prince will also be unable to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since gaining the \"elite name\", the Wrightshire Legion has been given high hopes by all parties and has become a model of publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar is no exception. The army in front of him directly affects the key to his success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't even notice the fighters, so how could he be willing to put the most important chips in his hand to the front line so early, fighting against the orc army for consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for when to take action, Caesar is in no hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher-ups of the Alpha Kingdom did not have much expectation for the Principality of Moxi at all. As long as it can delay time, defeating the orc army is not considered at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that what is sent is reinforcements, but what is actually sent is confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending the Wrightshire Army over so quickly is essentially for the Principality of Moxi to see, so as to strengthen their determination to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson's nervous heart eased slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Crown Prince Caesar doesn't nod his head, it will be easy for the Principality of Moxi.

It is better to be valued than to be underestimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, to be able to get this treatment, apart from the fact that the Wright County Legion was the first reinforcement to arrive, it is more about the military appearance they showed, which can be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Change a mob to come and harm the localities all the way forward. Before the people reach the front line, the notoriety has already spread throughout the country, and there is no capital to use it for political propaganda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of thousands of people walked together at a uniform pace, and the momentum alone made the Moxi Principality very satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I personally confirmed that this is a real elite teacher, definitely not a parallel importer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for why this elite came from a remote county, that is the internal affairs of the Alpha Kingdom, and there is no obligation to explain it to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was stationed in the camp outside, but Hudson followed Crown Prince Caesar into the city for a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from before, in order to establish the image of a strict self-disciplined general, he must stay in the barracks for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The necessary entertainment involving military affairs is obviously different from the nature of the nobles' treats along the way. This is a public matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble officers below can only stay in the camp obediently. Even if you want to go, you can't receive a banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the lord of a country, if he is willing to personally invite Hudson to a banquet, that is already the limit of a corporal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The barons and knights who are further down have such a huge disparity in status that they are not qualified to participate in this kind of banquet at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to break the limit, there is only one situation, and that is the celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Riding on horseback in the bustling city of Dapace, the air is filled with a tense atmosphere of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only more than two hundred miles away from the front line, and it seems that there are three lines of defense in the middle, but in fact one is weaker than the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vast plains made the Principality of Moxi strong and prosperous, and also determined the strategic defense difficulties of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except that the Fort Augustus line of defense was built on the remnants of the Parhati Mountains, the following lines of defense were all built on the plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost the most important line of defense at the beginning, and Hudson didn't know how to evaluate the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Said they were useless, and now relying on the second line of defense, they temporarily blocked the front of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To say that they are powerful, they lost the most important line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Augustsburg defense line is in hand, even if the orc army concentrates the main force to attack, the Principality of Moxi can hold on for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, we can only expect reinforcements from our allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the luxurious banquet opened Hudson's eyes, he couldn't help but marvel at the wealth of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, they dared to spend so much. I don't know if it's because the family is really rich, or because I haven't experienced the power of the beastmen's beatings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the outbreak of the Alpha Kingdom war, the king took the lead in stopping the banquet. The expectations of the two sides for war losses are not at the same level at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Princess Anne and Princess Susan are here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beauties can attract people's attention anywhere, especially beauties with superimposed status and temperament, which are more lethal to men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two beauties, one big and one small, instantly attracted a large number of outstanding young men. Watching the crowd surround him, Hudson silently chose to watch from afar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two in front of him are not something he can peek at. The mainland of Aslant is strictly hierarchical, and political marriage is essential for the king's daughter to marry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either the prince of various countries, or the eldest son of a great noble. The rules of the game are like this, marriages across classes are doomed not to be blessed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the situation at the scene, you can tell that on the surface, the two princesses treat all the objects of courtship equally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the treatment enjoyed by Crown Prince Caesar was obviously different. Although there are many words to say, the eyes have already said everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the young heroes who were immersed in it, all the bystanders including Hudson saw that it was unusual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person, and no one is foolish to tear down the stage at this time. As the heir of the Alpha Kingdom, Crown Prince Caesar has the capital to enjoy differential treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For all the big figures present, if it is possible to promote the marriage of a certain princess and Crown Prince Caesar, it will definitely be beneficial to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this kind of matter, the two royal families have secretly communicated. Otherwise, there are so many nobles in the Alpha Kingdom, why does it have to be Crown Prince Caesar to lead the team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is gold-plated, it is enough to arrange the position of the deputy. It is irresponsible to let a prince who has never been on the battlefield command an army to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-ranking princess dare not provoke her, but Hudson also keeps a respectful distance from the ladies and ladies below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, I don't know anyone, who knows where they all come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aventure, that also scores time. If at this juncture, the waistband is not managed well, and people are offended without knowing it, it is easy to be cheated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, don't you want to chat with the noble ladies?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While enjoying the delicious food alone, a strange voice sounded in his ears. Looking along the sound, Hudson was slightly taken aback, then smiled and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's leave this opportunity to others. I already have a fiancée, so I won't join in the fun now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the truth, he can only see the untouchable noble lady, he is really not interested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from a singer like Isabel, even if she is in the house, it is just a romantic affair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the lady of the same status, or a nobleman with a higher rank, gets infected, my fiancée can't explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the marriage will fail, but instead it will become a feud. After all, to nobles, divas are just for fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My father-in-law has raised a lot of people, and Melissa's psychological endurance has probably been tempered by her father's practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much you love her, the diva is always just a diva, and it is impossible to threaten the status of the mistress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be different if you change to a noble lady. If this kind of extramarital affair continues, it can easily be transformed into a mistress and reverse the position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although divorce is not popular in Aslante, there are still widows!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can bear this kind of existence that may threaten their status. Especially before the wedding, there is no possibility of tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's really a pity! If this news gets out, I'm afraid many noble ladies will feel sad secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look over there, how many noble ladies are staring at you? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg laughed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's appearance can only be considered average, and he is not the type of heartthrob, but he has already gained fame, and his whole body exudes the charm of a strong man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mu Qiang is a woman's natural instinct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status of Crown Prince Caesar is too high for everyone to reach. Hudson, a growth stock, is also the favorite of noble ladies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, then I can only regret it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, I dare not compare with Your Excellency the Prime Minister for my charm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of noble ladies over there are desperate to see through now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Prime Minister Herceg was deliberately approaching, Hudson also let go of the concerns about the gap in everyone's identities, and directly joked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he is now a guest, so even if he is slightly rude, it is not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson can really speak, but I am still very confident in my charm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when I am old, there are not a few noble ladies who try to plot my body. It's a pity that time is not forgiving, and your body is no younger than yours. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Prime Minister Herceg's narcissistic words, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly. With a potbellied appearance, he dares to talk about charm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the status bonus of the prime minister, I'm afraid everyone would ignore him, let alone throw himself into his arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you carefully study the identities of these ladies, you will find that most of them married into declining noble families, or were directly widowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to play happily is purely because no one cares. In other words, interests need to be sacrificed in exchange for some family interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morality has always been a luxury. For the rotten nobles, this thing doesn't exist at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not knowing Prime Minister Herceg's intentions, Hudson simply dealt with some irrelevant topics. Regarding specific affairs, it is one push, four, five, six.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clarify your position with practical actions: talk to Crown Prince Caesar if you have any problems, and others will speak lightly and will not join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really immoral to blame the boss directly, but who made Crown Prince Caesar busy chasing women at this moment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson already faintly felt something was wrong. The Principality of Moxi is playing a beauty trick. If the young crown prince falls for the trick, he will be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing to be thankful for is that he made preparations in advance and labeled the \"elite\" for the Wrightshire Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An elite division is a luxury in any country. Unless it is absolutely necessary, everyone will not abandon an elite army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was afraid of bad luck, so I ran into the main force of the orcs. The scene of the fake elite facing the real elite is simply unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the Mongolian Army was defeated in the wild, that would be no big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the same strength, there is no human army whose combat effectiveness can be compared with Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with such a powerful opponent, even if they were defeated, no one would doubt the combat effectiveness of the Wright Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Characters who are good at using soldiers will not collapse, but \"good luck\" characters will be difficult to maintain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you encounter the Beamon Army, you can safely evacuate with most of the soldiers and horses. You can also announce to the outside world with a cheeky face: retreat under the hands of the Beamon Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Afraid of what to come, on the fifth day after the banquet, Hudson received an order to send troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, all our troops have not yet arrived. With only the strength of the Wrightshire Army, they rushed to the front line, and I am afraid that even the waves will not be stirred up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson argued with reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has already made up his mind, if there is no satisfactory answer, whoever wants to do what he wants to do with the matter of sending troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the crown prince cannot force a nobleman to lead his troops to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things get worse, Hudson certainly has a hard time, and the reputation of Crown Prince Caesar will also be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes a person with a crooked ass, not even the crown prince. Before making a decision, the crown prince must also prioritize protecting the interests of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, don't be angry. If I hadn't had to, I would not agree to the proposal of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really an emergency on the front line, and the Terence defense line that the Principality of Moxi painstakingly built is now becoming shaky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the frontline officers and soldiers has been greatly affected, and they are in urgent need of a good news stimulus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Wright County Legion is now rushing to the front line, mainly for the middle and lower level officers and soldiers of the Principality of Moxi, and does not need to go into battle immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We just need to take the army and patrol the front line to prove to the frontline soldiers of the Principality of Moxi that reinforcements are coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the task is completed, the Wrightshire Army will be transferred to the rear castle to garrison. As long as the front line doesn't collapse, we basically won't encounter the orc army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the relaxed expression on Crown Prince Caesar's face, Hudson was also speechless. On the bright side, there is nothing wrong with the proposal of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the battlefield is ever-changing. If it really comes to the front line, can it be as simple as the Moxi people said?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Basically there will be no encounters with the orc army\", which means that encounters may occur. What is the probability of this encounter, I am afraid no one can say clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging by the appearance of Crown Prince Caesar, it is obvious that he has agreed to the Mosi people. If he refuses at this time, Master Hudson will not be a human being inside and out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everyone promised not to participate in the war, just an armed parade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, if the Moxi people can guarantee it, then it is not a bad idea to go to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the ugly words must be said first. In case something happens midway and we need reinforcements, it depends on the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the flags of the five royal families of the orcs all appeared in the Principality of Moxi. Even if not all of the main force came, at least 10 to 20% came, and it was still increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case something happens to them together, heavy losses are inevitable, and it is unknown whether they can escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, it is best for His Highness to stay in Da Pest City. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said unhappily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's due to the beauty trick. Anyway, Crown Prince Caesar was able to get rid of him as a front-line commander and directly agreed to the conditions of the Mosi people. Hudson dared not take it to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case something goes wrong on the battlefield and the situation gets out of control, as a vassal of the king, he has no way to leave the crown prince and run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, it is better to throw this unstable factor to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they don't stay together, even if an accident happens to the Crown Prince, he will be able to clear up his responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if stimulated, Crown Prince Caesar looked at Hudson angrily and asked: \"How can this work?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I am not with the troops, what am I, a commander?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Hudson, don't forget that I am the supreme commander of the coalition forces! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was also a little confused. Judging from Caesar's performance alone, he didn't know if he was acting or if he was really angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, our task is to carry out an armed parade. Naturally, the faster the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You represent not only yourself, but also the Alpha Kingdom. In terms of etiquette, one must not embarrass the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you come to the front line in person, all kinds of ritual utensils will be a big trouble. This will greatly reduce the mobility of the troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson talked nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the ostentation of representing the kingdom cannot be spared, but it also depends on when. They have all gone to the battlefield, and they have to abide by these rules, which is purely a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing signs of escalation in the conflict, Count Jose on the side hastily persuaded: \"Your Highness, Viscount Hudson is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom's face cannot be lost, but these things are really not suitable to be brought to the front line. In case of encountering an army of orcs, accidentally missing it on the battlefield, and falling into the hands of orcs, it will not end well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he knows the military. Hudson is worried that Crown Prince Caesar will go to the front to make trouble, and Earl Jose is also worried about Caesar's safety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the human civil war, the orcs don't care about their status. Not to mention the crown prince, even the king would still kill him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, expressing dissatisfaction. Crown Prince Caesar waved his sleeves, turned and left without looking back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether he was really angry or acting, Hudson didn't have the time to delve into it. Anyway, he knew that this trouble was temporarily out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a direct supervisor, Master Hudson has the final say on how to fight on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, I'm sorry. Your Royal Highness, he has been in a bad mood recently, so he lost his composure just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You still need to worry about things in the army. Especially after going to the front line, the Moxi people may not really fulfill their promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find something is wrong, you need to make a decision on the spot. As for the military order, unless it was sent by our people and passed on from generation to generation by others, you can deny it at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose said rather embarrassingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar can slap his **** and leave, but his deputy must leave to deal with the aftermath. The crown prince above couldn't afford to offend, and the powerful nobles below, he also didn't want to offend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, he has experienced Hudson's control over the Wright County Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the nobles below wanted to flatter the crown prince, none of them dared to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that the order of the crown prince must be approved by Hudson before the officers and soldiers below will seriously implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the source of the conflict between the two sides. After finally having a chance to command the army, he found out that he was a rubber stamp, and normal people would be angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar has a good temper if he can hold back all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good your temper is, it has its limits. The unhappy conversation just now made Caesar realize that his dignity had been seriously challenged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is understandable to persuade him to stay, but he has to come up with a decent reason anyway. Directly using the nonsense excuse of \"etiquette\" made him feel that his IQ was deeply insulted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even more exasperating was the deputy, not only did not stand by his side as the coach, but followed him along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A wonderful misunderstanding that escalates the conflict. It made Hudson a little dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From beginning to end, he thought that Crown Prince Caesar was acting. Accompanied by a beautiful princess in the city of Da Pest, who is full and insists on going to the front line to experience the sword, light and sword?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanation is impossible to explain, and this kind of thing will only get darker and darker. After all, Crown Prince Caesar was just a young man who had not received severe beatings from society, and was not used to being manipulated by the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't stand this little grievance, you will have a hard time living in the future. The great nobles in the kingdom don't have a fuel-efficient lamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king is slightly weak, they will rub their noses on their faces. Stronger than a hero like Caesar III, he is also not less angry with the domestic nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to become a qualified king, you need to go through a lot of things like being reprimanded by nobles in the future.

Compared with the unhappy breakup a few days ago, his mental state has now been adjusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the happy expression on his face, Hudson knew that he had a good time in the past few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson is also very happy now. Before the army set off, the Moxi people also offered a generous gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, there is nothing wrong with bureaucracy. At least in terms of human relationships, be sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With short hands, Hudson was very cooperative on the march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how many miles the army of the Principality of Moxi travels every day, the Wright County Army will follow as many miles as possible, and will never delay time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc camp, a large number of troops gathered, and clusters of flags were flying all over the sky. The scene was very spectacular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many people and too many things. An empire ruled by the five royal families has never had anything to do with unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When dealing with the human race, the five royal families are allies. In normal times, everyone is a competitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the threat of the human race, the overlord of the continent, the five royal families of the orcs were able to sit together and discuss issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no external threat, they can do it themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The end of the orc continent's hegemony is half due to the human race, and half is the result of their internal struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families have been arguing for a month about the choice of the main attack direction, but they are still deadlocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Clan and the Yinyue Wolf Clan advocated continuing to attack the Principality of Moxi, while the Beamon and Eagle Clan proposed to reverse the direction and attack the Warhammer Kingdom, and the Bear Clan said that both sides were fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have their own reasons, and neither can convince the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the army continues to gather, the direction of attack has not yet been determined, and the five royal families are also a little anxious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We can't drag it on any longer!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, the reinforcements from the Alpha Kingdom have entered the Principality of Moxi and are about to arrive at the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcements from other human nations are also starting one after another. In the next month, the Principality of Moxi will be able to receive reinforcements from at least five countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance meeting is about to be held. If we don't quickly make a breakthrough on the battlefield and attract all ethnic groups in the mainland to join this war, we will be driven back in despair! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingrenhuang said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orcs respect the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the lead in making a breakthrough in the Principality of Moxi, and achieving the biggest record since the war began, which undoubtedly greatly enhanced his right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the strategic advantage he had finally obtained was disappearing in the quarrel, Yingrenhuang's anger also rose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor doesn't have to worry, we all know the efficiency of the Terran Alliance meeting, and it won't take a year or so to get results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Human Race Alliance does not fully intervene, the few Human Race countries in the Northland are not our opponents at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the countries sending reinforcements to the Principality of Moxi, they are actually a bunch of low-class people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reaction of the Alpha Kingdom, they are not optimistic that their allies can block our soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that reinforcements were dispatched immediately, but they also put a lot of energy on the construction of a new line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Numerous wars in the past have proved that it is unrealistic to pull the human race from the overlord of the mainland at once. The best way is to gradually erode their territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi is flat, and it is indeed easy to take it down, but it is also easy for the human race to take it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Located between the Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Warhammer, the human race would not tolerate losing such a strategic location.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the Warhammer Kingdom next door is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The north is a world of ice and snow, only some declining races occupy it, and it is completely useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few small human kingdoms to the west. It is estimated that before we can fight there, the gang of elves will take them down first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking down the Kingdom of Warhammer, the Pingchuan Principality of Moxi is still in our pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, we can completely spend time with the human race in the Principality of Moxi, and wait and see the changes in the situation on the mainland before making the next decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the various tribes join in, we will continue the war; if the situation becomes corrupt, then we will abandon the Principality of Moxi and stick to the territory of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After digesting the results of the battle, the next war will continue to settle with the human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, the Orc Empire won some northern provinces of the Alpha Kingdom, and everyone got a bonus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of development, the actual strength of the Orc Empire has increased by 10-20% compared to before the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number may not seem large, but for a race struggling to survive in the cracks, any increase in strength is of great significance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing the benefits of cannibalization, the Beamon clan's concept has also changed. Instead of seeking to destroy the hegemony of the human race in World War I, they have turned to advocating the cannibalization strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex, you think too well. The human race is not stupid, how can they watch us continue to encroach on their territory and do nothing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was an accident last time, but this kind of accident will never happen often.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we win the Warhammer Kingdom, the Terran Alliance will definitely counterattack at all costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid not to mention defending the Warhammer Kingdom, even the land we occupy now will lose a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to keep the loot, you have to injure the human race so hard that they have no time to take care of us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority is to destroy the Principality of Moxi as soon as possible, sweep away a bunch of small countries behind them, and then turn around and destroy the Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our speed is fast enough, it is entirely possible to complete most of the strategies before the arrival of human reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the enemies of the human race are all over the continent. Only when there are major changes in the north, the various races will not be idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, the entire continent will be in chaos, and the Terran Alliance might not even have the energy to recruit reinforcements!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a radical among the orcs, he didn't want to give up halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally gained the strategic initiative. If the human race is not ruthlessly slaughtered, the next time is unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, the Eagle Emperor is a natural choice. Accustomed to playing tricks secretly, he dare not confront the human race head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex's choice is even simpler. In the last war, Emperor Bimon's encroachment plan was implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince, if he overthrows his own father's strategy, wouldn't he feel that his position is too stable and want to find excitement?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, don't care about the strategy, you have to fight it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my opinion, it is better to tear through the defense line of the Principality of Moxi first and annihilate their main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After solving this part of the enemy, whether it is to destroy the Principality of Moxie, or to turn around and attack the Kingdom of Warhammer, it will become easier. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that lazy appearance, it doesn't look like an emperor at all, but more like a lazy bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't have the ability to adjust the conflict between the two sides. Come up with a better strategy, the same can not be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing he is good at is making peace with each other, jumping out at critical moments to ease the conflict between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Although the Terence defense line of the Principality of Moxi is not as good as the Augustsburg defense line, they are now stationed with heavy troops, and it is not easy to take it down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we take a risk, cross their fortress and lead an army to attack the city of Dapace, forcing them to call out the main force for a decisive battle! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King on the side said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The border defense line of the Principality of Moxi also stretches for hundreds of miles. Naturally, such a long distance cannot be all fortresses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In most areas, only city walls were built. Only important passes and strategic locations have built strong fortresses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other areas, a castle is only set up within five to ten miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defensive power can only be considered average, and it is okay to block a small group of orcs. It is only a matter of time before the army falls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the orc army is willing, they can break through the defense line at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the fortress on the only road has not been captured, and the logistics may be cut off at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To support war with war, just listen to it. If you really fight, you will find that the spoils of war are far from keeping up with the consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orcs are not picky eaters, the consumption of more than 600,000 troops cannot be easily satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if food is not considered, some necessary supplies are also indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sneak attack, which is based on the fact that the enemy is not prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi's army along the way is not dead. The orc army broke through and entered. This kind of news will definitely be passed back as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A well-prepared city cannot be taken down in three to five days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of life and death, nobles and bureaucrats can also work hard. The noble lord who seems to have a big belly can also kill people with a knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the perfect city defense fortifications, coupled with various magical black technologies, the price to be paid for storming the city of Dapace is definitely not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quick battle and quick decision is purely a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcing the main force of the Principality of Moxi to come out of the fortress for a decisive battle, it was completely a gamble on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only do you have to bet on the high-level officials of the principality to make wrong decisions, but you also have to bet that the nobles and generals on the front line are all good boys and will obey the principality's orders 100%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the oil bottle, Hudson only felt relaxed when he led the army to gallop on the land of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are a group of followers behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he finally understood why Prime Minister Herceg wanted to make friends with him. It was his son who led Moxi's army this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of Moxi's army, you can tell that this is another private army of aristocrats put together improvised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small number of soldiers who are elite, most of them are mobs. The visual training time shall not exceed three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers who didn't even complete basic military training were also sent to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality of soldiers has dropped to this point, which is enough to prove how hard the Principality of Moxi is resisting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just defending the city, it seems that the problem is not too big. It's nothing more than exchanging lives for lives. The three northern countries are now playing with orcs to exchange lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people are different. Knowing that the front line is full of dangers, they arranged their children to a safe area early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the local army, which is responsible for defending the territory, the guest army undoubtedly has a much higher degree of freedom, and they can escape when they encounter danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially with a \"master\" like Hudson, the survivability on the battlefield is much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking a group of second-generation children to the battlefield, Hudson can only lament that being too famous is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people staring at him, it is inconvenient to do anything. In case of a big defeat, resulting in the death of a large number of second-generation children, even the guest army would not be able to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only advantage is that the possibility of being reduced to cannon fodder is greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Involving so many rich and powerful children, when assigning tasks, don't mention special care, at least they won't receive tasks of ten deaths and no lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that Hudson hinted at the Mosi people with practical actions: the mission of sending death will not be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fight with Crown Prince Caesar was not for nothing. On the territory of the Mosi people, the quarrel of the day was naturally passed on to the ears of these dignitaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A guest army who can fight but is not very obedient. While making everyone helpless, it also made some smart people see a different kind of opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Children who need to be specially arranged by their parents, their personal abilities are naturally not that strong. The real elite children have long served in the army and devoted themselves to the battle of defending their home and country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the children are all good and bad. It is impossible for them to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately reduced to a nanny, Hudson became more and more cautious. Looking into the distance, he immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, and half of the heavy armored infantry will put on the armor and advance. The horses will be sent out for thirty miles to investigate the enemy's situation, and pay close attention to all the strange movements around them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Be careful there is no big mistake. Although the possibility of a large orc army crossing the defense line and driving straight in without being detected is very low, it does not mean that there is no possibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an encounter, you will suffer a big loss if you are not prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, a familiar voice came from behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Hudson, you are too cautious. This is the hinterland of the principality, and there are still a hundred miles away from the front line. Even if you encounter an orc army, there will only be a small group of miscellaneous soldiers who accidentally broke in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a large group breaks through and enters, it is impossible for the defenders on the front line not to send back information. With the strength of your army, there is no need to worry at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at the fat man behind him, Hudson replied angrily: \"Viscount Raquel, we are going to fight, not go on an outing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any negligence may bring huge losses to the troops. Other actions can be lost, but don't forget that we only have one life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it falls into the hands of orcs, what will happen to you? You don't want to experience it even if you think about it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a picture of a fat man falling into the hands of the orcs and tied to a barbecue grill appeared in Hudson's mind, and the two soldiers couldn't lift it no matter what.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He weighs more than 500 pounds, and he is full of fat as far as he can see. It is definitely the best food for orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound suddenly sounded, and the marching team silently gave way to a road, letting Tan Ma run wildly on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report to the head of the army, the traces of the orc army were found 30 miles ahead, and the exact number is still in the process of ascertaining.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the bad news, Hudson was almost shocked. Raquel's crow's mouth said just now that he would not collide with the orc army, but he ran into it so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't take it anymore, that's it for today, don't wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They all had dumbfounded expressions, followed by exclamations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flying bear with its feet on the air has blinded the eyes of countless people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson corrected the ground turtle's flying appearance more than once. It's a pity that Bear Stearns insisted that it was running, not flying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone came back to their senses, the figures of one person and one bear had disappeared into the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, he appeared at the place where the traces of the orc army were found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original giant bear was shrunk down into a miniature version again, leaving Hudson's figure in the air, as if he was volleying against the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you see this scene without knowing it, you will definitely exclaim—\"Sky Knight\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking down at the orc army below, Hudson couldn't help scolding Bear Stearns for being unreliable deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The promised secret investigation has now become a patrol.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at the innocent Bear Stearns, Hudson could only forcefully quell his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, bears have different concepts from people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on Bear Stearns' gravity magic, walking in the air is actually a kind of enjoyment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for this accident, Hudson wouldn't even have known about the cub's manipulation of the gravity field to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that Xiongxin is not ancient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that Bear Stearns was the first to show off any new magic or new gameplay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, even if Hudson asked, it would be perfunctory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He almost said: I am a useless bear, don't come to me if you have anything to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being so lazy, he has become the top powerhouse in the mainland. This shattered Hudson's lemon heart into pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking that he practiced hard every day and dared not stop for a day, but he was still dangling on the threshold of the great knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think about it, it's important to get down to business now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately released a mist magic, enveloping one person and one bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking from a distance, it looks like a dark cloud floating in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patroling the orc army all the way, Hudson's heart was tense and exciting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the chaotic team, there are tauren, cat people, Colinbus... all kinds of messy races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until a banner with a **** wolf's head appeared that Hudson raised his vigilance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary wolf cavalry are not terrible, and their combat effectiveness is not much higher than that of humans. What is terrifying is the orc royal family - the Silver Moon Wolf Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The judging method is very beastly, just look at the body shape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary werewolf soldiers are only 1.56 meters; Yinyue wolves start at 2 meters, and some burly soldiers can even reach 3 meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparing the size, you can know the strength of the Yinyue Wolf Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing to be thankful for is that the number of Silver Moon wolves is rare, and their reproduction pattern is different from that of ordinary races, but evolved from ordinary werewolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of awakening is purely luck. Even if the parents are from the Silver Moon Wolf Clan, most of the offspring will be ordinary werewolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, the Silver Moon Werewolf appeared as a commander, just like the alpha wolf among wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a rough calculation of the number of wolf cavalry, there are more than 5,000 people. Hudson knows that this battle is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the distance between the two armies is less than ten miles, and there are so many fast wolf cavalry on the other side, it is almost impossible to avoid them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the orc army in front of us is less than 20,000. Even if there are a small number of elite orcs, the two sides are still worthy of a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lead the army to run away now, you will be chased by the orc army. I'm afraid it will directly evolve into a big rout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After inspecting a radius of dozens of miles, no trace of other orc troops was found, and Hudson returned directly to the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Hudson, what is the strength of the orc army ahead?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel asked nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffered a round of beatings by orcs, the nobles of the Principality of Moxi almost became frightened birds, because they turned pale when they heard the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, there are less than 20,000 orcs in front of the army. It is worth noting that there are mainly 5,000 wolf cavalry. The rest of the ethnic army is very chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps some races have good individual combat effectiveness, but individual strength cannot play a big role in melee combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I inspected in the past, and the fortress on the front line has not fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This team should have bypassed the fortress and forced their way in from other areas. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the coalition army has 30,000 soldiers and horses, a solid force advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, his Wrightshire Army was the only one worthy of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the improvised team of the Moxi people, in Hudson's view, it was just used to fill up the number of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just these words, there's no problem thinking about it. Saying it out would be too emotionally illicit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how poor the fighting power of the allies is, there are still 10,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really can't fight, you have to run away, which is also a good meat shield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The calm performance failed to appease the soldiers. Especially after hearing the five thousand wolf cavalry, it caused an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in Wright County are okay. They are used to seeing orc slaves, so they don't have much fear in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some nobles from the North have already begun to use their rich combat experience to think about countermeasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second generation of the Moxi Principality will not work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were dawdlers with little ability, but after hearing the news about the orc army, they all panicked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson also became angry, and immediately reprimanded:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Quiet me up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a military camp, not a vegetable market, anyone who continues to make noise will get out of here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you don't have a strategy in mind, please follow the command quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this battle, the Wrightshire Army is in charge of confronting the enemy. You lie in ambush a mile away, and come out to flank the opponent when you receive the signal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send down the order to let all the ministries find favorable terrain to form formations and wait for the orc army to come!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the cavalry gather and follow me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the terrain of Pingchuan, it is extremely difficult to play tactics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent the rout from attacking the army formation, Hudson could only keep the army of the Principality of Moxi outside the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called ambush is purely for comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without terrain cover, no matter how tens of thousands of horses can hide, they will inevitably be discovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry phalanx can only withstand the enemy's attack. If you want to deal with the enemy's wolf cavalry, you still have to rely on cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gather all the cavalry in the two teams, a total of more than a thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing five thousand wolf cavalry head-on, there was almost no chance of winning, and Hudson's brain was already working quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Patriarch, there is a large army of people in front of us blocking our way, and the number of people is tens of thousands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is very vigilant, and our people lost more than a dozen scouts as soon as they approached for investigation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what his subordinates said, the old man was instantly furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers who can act as scouts are all elite wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing more than a dozen people and only getting a vague piece of information, it is really a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"They're all **** Ying people, isn't it because everyone's strategy is at odds, and they didn't even provide us with information, and they just wanted to make a fool of my wolf clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just wait, I will settle this account with them after this battle! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the group of people who were standing still, the old man couldn't help but reprimanded:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you still doing in a daze, hurry up and organize an attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget our mission, we can't just give up because of a sudden appearance of a human army, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to be so reckless, the old man also has confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the Principality of Moxi is mostly concentrated in the fortresses on the front line, and there are very few elites in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, with the mobility of wolf cavalry, as long as they are not under siege. Even if you can't beat the enemy, you can still run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategy and tactics, for the patriarch of an ordinary tribe, the distance is too far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of previous battles, they always went directly forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This set of superficial tactics can win most of the time. Even if you fail, you can get out of your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has been no accident, otherwise the old man would not be alive now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal competition of the orc empire is far more intense than that of the human nations. In order to compete for resources, the battle between tribes almost never stops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel internal struggle is also the main driving force for the orcs to invade the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short time, a simple temporary camp was set up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While quietly waiting for the enemy to come to the door, Hudson also picked out soldiers who were good at riding and shooting, and equipped them with arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to play riding and shooting tactics, Hudson has no experience to learn from, so he can only **** for it by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the context of the huge disparity in the number of cavalry, there is no chance of winning head-on, so we can only find another way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry moves fast, and the corresponding defense is not much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wolf cavalry mounts are ferocious, but their waist is the biggest shortcoming. If you put on heavy armor, the wolf warrior will be useless before going to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When choosing wolf cavalry, not only must they have strong combat effectiveness, but also the size of the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The burly fat man was riding on the back of the war wolf, and the mount was tired and fell down in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a small number of evolved giant wolves can carry the load.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This high-end mount is exclusive to the Silver Moon Wolf Clan, a proper wolf noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"coming.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson stood up, looked at the orc army appearing in the sky, and suddenly had a strange idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you rush over with the cavalry now and disperse the group of orc miscellaneous soldiers, will the opponent be scared away?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little thought, Hudson gave up the idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elites are all made by fighting, and this orc army in front of us is just right for gaining experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, as a general, now he also needs military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Showing the enemy's weakness and luring the enemy to come over and give away his head is more meaningful than scaring away the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the enemy soldiers pressing down on the border, Hudson was not idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately, he took out his elven bow, and then drew out four arrows the size of short spears, and shot towards the leader of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a bang, the four unlucky ones fell down. But the arrow didn't stop, and continued to sprint forward, followed by a few more unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the brutal orc army, the soldiers of the vassal races were injured almost equal to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sudden blow, the orc army, which was originally full of murderous aura, suddenly became slightly chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having no time to pay attention to the reaction of the orc army, Hudson placed four more arrows on the bow and shot again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Repeated several times in a row, the orc leaders who were leading the battle were so frightened that they restrained themselves one after another, fearing that they would become the next unlucky one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dazzling record made all the soldiers of the Wright County Legion cheer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who got the lead, countless soldiers shouted together: \"Knight of the Divine Bow!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally tense war atmosphere was instantly dissipated, and morale was mobilized all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the orc army, it is gloomy at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong with the Wolf Clan officer, he immediately ordered: \"Sharp Archer, fight back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The centaur archer who came out of the team in response, set up his bow and arrow, and then stopped again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This distance has exceeded their longest range. There is no point in counterattacking except wasting precious arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at such a moment, these exposed archers have become Hudson's targets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the flying arrows, everyone was so frightened that they rushed to intercept them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a \"bang\", and the arrows of the two sides collided in the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Peak duel, but unfortunately the situation is one-sided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After defeating the intercepted arrows, the arrows fired by Hudson still hit the target, and the three centaur archers and one unlucky guy fell to the ground in close proximity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blocking just now was not in vain, the power of the arrow was weakened a lot, and he didn't continue to gallop on the battlefield after hitting the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was also secretly surprised by the scene in front of him. There is actually someone in the orc army who can stop an arrow with one shot, a proper marksman!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these centaur marksmen were unlucky and encountered enemies who cheated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He felt sorry for his opponent, but he didn't stop working.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\" arrows piercing the air became a nightmare for the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has not touched it yet, but his own people lose a piece first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader of the wolf tribe who received the message, in a rage, ordered angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy has only one sharpshooter, and he has already shot so many arrows, he won't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The whole army launches a charge, tear up the scraps of these human races for me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horn of the charge sounded, and the officer who gave the order accidentally exposed himself. Just a few steps forward with the army, he was taken away by an arrow that pierced through the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spray it, the level of war plot is limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you for this leader who can't lose his dream, I owe more +1. When Haiyue's code word speed improves, she will definitely return it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The chaotic charge was not good in every way, but one thing was good—the soldiers in front couldn't retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind him are not only comrades in arms, but also sharp knives. Not to mention turning around and running, even if you stay still, you may be accidentally injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the enemy is, they can only rush down without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the two sides fought together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The well-ordered military formation exerted extraordinary power at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The uniform heavy infantry appeared in front of the formation, pressing forward steadily step by step, while the archers behind were still throwing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall cooperation is still a little immature. But meeting a group of rabble orcs is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The position is constantly moving forward, and it is clear that in this confrontation, the Wright County Army has the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander-in-chief of the orc army in the distance gradually appeared in the sky. Seeing his own army retreating steadily, the old man riding on the giant wolf cursed in his heart as a waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the cannon fodder under his command was useless, the old man ordered indifferently:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, let the supervisory team take action, and anyone who retreats will be killed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Savalens, you lead a thousand wolf cavalry to attack from the enemy's left flank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Genelande, you lead a thousand wolf cavalry to attack from the enemy's right flank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brando, you led a thousand wolf riders to detour behind the enemy and launch an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find enemy cavalry blocking, you must entangle them to buy time for the army to siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three thousand light cavalry were dispatched in one breath, seemingly to attack the army formation, but the real target was the cavalry traveling outside the army formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled slightly. Not attacking from the flanks and bypassing the enemy's rear is because they are worried about the opponent's wolf cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, the opponent's coach had such a good appetite, and divided his troops to attack him in one gulp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing two groups of wolf cavalry go left and one group of wolf cavalry go right, when the other side is approaching, Hudson ordered without hesitation:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cavalry attack, follow me to intercept the enemy on the right flank!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the distance between the two cavalry teams was shortened to 300 meters. Hudson did not continue to lead the charge in a daze, but took out his bow and arrow and shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amidst the sound of arrows piercing the air with \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\", the arrows of the few war wolves rushing to the front rolled over and fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught off guard, the wolf cavalry behind him also ran into it. Under the chain reaction, more than a dozen wolves rolled over in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry, who fell to the ground, had no time to breathe a sigh of relief when they were ruthlessly trampled by their companions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Around...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy general had just opened his mouth to command, and before he had time to give an order, he was taken away by an arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made this guy so stupid that he dared to enter Hudson's range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the beginning of Hudson, when the distance between the two sides was further shortened, the officers and soldiers who were proficient in riding and shooting behind them began to follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, hundreds of wolf riders would die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry who reacted turned around to bypass the fallen companions, and launched an attack in a detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No defeat, Hudson was slightly taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many casualties and killing the enemy commander, the team did not collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is only a small problem. Facing the scattered wolf cavalry, it seems to have avoided stampede, but it also disrupted the charge formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, cast a gravity spell on the enemy wolf knight soldiers ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a turn of the bear's eyes, a large-scale wolf-turning incident erupted instantly. Dozens of wolves rushing forward suddenly fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many wolf riders have arrows on their bodies. If you don't look carefully, you may think that they are following in the footsteps of the previous ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only Hudson heard a fracture and understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emotion Bear Stearns' gravity technique didn't target the entire wolf rider, but only stayed on a certain front leg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a wolf stumbles, it also has to turn over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it's just a momentary leg cramp, even a roll while running at high speed will break the bone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson decisively ordered: \"Kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally agreed cavalry battle, as the \"wolf\" stumbled, turned into a scene where the cavalry beat the infantry, and the infantry was still without armor protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ferocious wolves were either dead or injured, so they could only stay where they were and struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the remaining wolf cavalry couldn't hold back any longer, and they all turned around and ran away, exposing their backs to the rain of arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A cavalry of a thousand-man team was directly defeated after just one hedge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry who were about to come for reinforcements were also shocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elite of the human race, definitely the elite of the human race!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the top elite of the human race, it is impossible to eat up a team of thousands of wolf riders so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring the two thousand wolf riders who came around the army formation, Hudson's goal was already aimed at the enemy camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just during the battle, the enemy commander had already rushed towards them with the rest of the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just saw that my own cavalry was defeated too quickly, and now I feel a little hesitant in my heart, and I can't help slowing down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Follow me to attack and capture the enemy commander alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Victory came too easily, and the fake elite has become a real elite at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One charge killed a team of thousands of wolf riders, and the morale of the army was completely raised to the peak at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea that the orcs are nothing more than this has now been implanted in their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spiritual transformation is reflected in actions, that is, everyone becomes more confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, I will find a way to get the opponent's handsome flag for me later.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the human coalition forces launched a countercharge, the old man who led the wolf cavalry forward suddenly became annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the enemy is so powerful, he would not divide his troops blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost a thousand-man team, and the other two thousand-man teams are still running around the enemy camp, so that now only the two thousand wolf cavalry are available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With only two thousand wolf cavalry, can the enemy be held back until another two thousand wolf cavalry come over for reinforcements?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This question, the old man is completely confused. After all, they are just an ordinary wolf tribe, most of them are ordinary werewolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire team, the Silver Moon Wolves accounted for less than one-tenth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced by the extraordinary elite composed of pure silver moon wolves, he would never hesitate to face the elite cavalry of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems impossible to retreat. Judging from the current situation on the battlefield, if he dares to turn around with his troops, it will turn into a big rout in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I came here with a mission, not just a simple outing. Losing the army and running away, the imperial court will definitely not spare him when he turns back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, the old man also wants to cry but has no tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't you say that the elite of the human race are all in the fortress on the front line?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why did he just sneak in after crossing the city wall, when he bumped into the iron plate. This made him find someone to reason with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gritting his teeth, the old man ordered cruelly: \"Kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dignity of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan does not allow him to flee without a fight. Instead of going back to accept the military law, it is better to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the 2,000 wolf cavalry sent back return, even the most elite cavalry of the human race can fight with them under the four times the force advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic flare was lifted into the air, and Moxi's army, which was lurking one mile away, instantly stood up from the wheat field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the second-generation children are not very capable, they are quite courageous, especially when they are fighting against the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a small distance, with the help of magic equipment, everything that happened on the battlefield has not been hidden from their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific details are not clear, anyway, the Wright County Legion is now suppressing the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The record of the cavalry led by Hudson himself made them more confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw Raquel pull out the wheat straw covering the horse, jumped on the horse and raised his arms and gave an order:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Attack with the whole army, let the **** orcs know that we mossi are not easy to mess with!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, he rode his horse and appeared in front of the team, leading the whole army to set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of second-generation children who were belatedly aware also followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to beat a dog in the water are rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you miss this opportunity to make contributions, you will have to regret it for the rest of your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on their status and background, such a war has been fought twice, and a wealthy fief is no problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden appearance of the human army made the orc army, which was already at a disadvantage, become even more panicked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man who commanded the battle was so angry that his beard stood on end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He already knew that this group of mobs were unreliable, but he never expected that they would be so unreliable that he didn't even know that there was a human army lurking nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an ugly misunderstanding. How could it be possible to keep it completely secret with an army lurking at such a small distance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persevering, there are many races among the orcs, and there are many conflicts among them. In addition, the battle broke out too suddenly, and the orc soldiers who found something wrong were sent to the battlefield before they had time to report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    were all sent to perform the task of sending them to death, so they simply didn't bother to report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being tricked by his own family, it is too late for the old man to regret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrows that pierced through the air continued to devour the lives of the wolf cavalry, telling that the distance between the two sides had narrowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Snapped!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a loud noise, Shuai Qi behind him immediately fell down. If it wasn't for the old man's quick reaction, he would have almost been hit by his handsome flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man hid in the past, and the guard in front of him was not so lucky. He was directly photographed into meatloaf including a man and a wolf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, a handsome flag definitely does not have such power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A master attacked the camp!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, the old man's hairs stood up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of strength, he is not inferior to ordinary human land knights. But even so, I still don't know who succeeded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the enemy targeted Shuaiqi. If the target of the sneak attack was himself, the outcome would not be much better than that of Shuaiqi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, the old man cursed himself for being stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meet the elite of the human race, how could it be possible that there are no masters to go with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous series of victories made him mistakenly think that the human race was nothing more than that. Completely ignoring the overlord of the continent of Aslante, it is a seemingly unimportant human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't even know the strength of the enemy, so he led the army to kill him directly. Now he can't wait to give himself a big mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to say anything, the hand-to-hand combat begins, and you can't run if you want to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know why, the frequency of “wolf” stumbles is extremely high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a round of slashing cavalry hedging, hundreds of wolf cavalry stayed on the battlefield permanently because of the \"wolves\" stumbled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to compare the casualties of the two sides, and only looked at the rest of his team. The old man immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go, first go to join the team!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who had just turned his horse's head, saw that the enemy had already run away, and his expression suddenly became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big advantage just now was not because of how powerful the cavalry was, but because Bear Stearns was secretly helping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First broke the opponent's commander-in-chief flag, and then continued to plot against the opponent's cavalry, only then did he have a brilliant record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the remaining more than a thousand cavalry join the other two thousand-man teams, the next battle will not be so easy to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the absolute numerical advantage of the enemy, even if they can win, the loss will definitely not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in the previous round of hedging, dozens of cavalry fell from their horses, and now their lives are unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is gone!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who yelled such a voice, but the situation on the battlefield changed drastically in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I couldn't find the orc infantry of my commander-in-chief, only saw my own cavalry being chased and killed, and the crumbling morale completely collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the soldiers of all ethnic groups fleeing for their lives in a hurry, the supervising team also seemed powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the fleeing orcs, he aimed the knife directly at the intercepting supervising team, forcibly slashing a **** path from behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was defeated like a mountain, and the old man, who realized that the defeat was a foregone conclusion, did not care about seeking revenge from Hudson after gathering his own cavalry, and ran away directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that their luck was not very good, and they happened to collide with the moxi army who came to beat the dog in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually, when encountering so many cavalry rushing over, even if they didn't drop their weapons and run away, they would be trembling with fright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time it was different. The second generation who wanted to make contributions rose up and led the army and wolf cavalry to meet them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army formation full of flaws can imagine the scene of encountering wolf cavalry. He was rushed into the formation in an instant and suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy casualties did not deter the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of hatred + the mind of making contributions made the second generation once again organize an army to stand in front of the wolf cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is an army of tens of thousands of people. How can it be so easily penetrated when one's own side wins a big victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrows, short spears, flying hammers... all parried at the wolf cavalry, and the two sides fought back and forth for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short delay, Hudson's team had already appeared behind them, and a battle of annihilation kicked off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The wolf cavalry, who were eager to break out, now passively made this mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After catching up, Hudson did not rush to lead the charge, but decisively chose Arrow Rain to entertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry who exposed their backs became a living target, and screamed in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxie infantry intercepted in front, and Hudson cavalry chased after them. The morale of the wolf cavalry, which was already in panic, became even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man, who realized that something was wrong, could no longer care about the army at this moment, and ordered indifferently: \"Scatter and break through!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the wolf mount under him had rushed out, and his figure disappeared into the army in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The already chaotic wolf cavalry became even more chaotic at this moment. Many soldiers no longer cared about so much, and rushed out in any direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of life and death, one can always unleash the greatest potential. The sudden outbreak of wolf cavalry startled Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after seeing these guys desperately breaking through, Hudson's worries disappeared in an instant. There is nothing to worry about if the trapped beast is still fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If thousands of cavalry resisted stubbornly, it would not be so easy to take it down for a while, but once they were defeated and fled, the situation would be very different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wolf cavalry was running, and the orc infantry on the side was even worse. At the moment, they were being chased by the Wrightshire Army and were running around the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the heavy infantry moves too slowly to do the work of chasing and killing. However, they were not idle, and were slowly approaching the cavalry battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the wolf cavalry does not disperse and break through, they will soon experience the wonderful feeling of being squeezed by heavy infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The siege lasted for two hours before Hudson gave the order to stop the pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few wolf riders who were lucky to break through, most of them were destroyed in the final siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the battlefield was too chaotic, and the commander of the orc army slipped away inadvertently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to do this. In a big melee, as long as the strong want to run away, it is difficult to be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson finds out, it is impossible for Hudson to let Bear Stearns chase him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case there are still powerful orcs lurking, after Bear Stearns left, it would be a tragedy in life to give him a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to count the results of the battle, Hudson hurriedly organized the priest to rescue the wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Krypton life is krypton life, living on the battlefield is more important than anything else. Only those who survived need to think about the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the wailing second generations all over the floor, Hudson found that these guys can still be dealt with. All kinds of unreliable things in normal times, but they can really be topped at critical moments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no appeasement of the army, as a winner, you only need to celebrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are priests, and the lightly wounded will be able to jump around very quickly, and the seriously wounded will belch soon, so it is enough to directly count the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the privilege of the \"elite troops\". If it were replaced by ordinary miscellaneous troops, the pastor would not have the time to treat low-level soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a matter of being cold-hearted, but mainly because the number of priests is limited, and they simply cannot be equipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the high-ranking priests, the entire Wrightshire Legion only had two of them, and the Kingdom equipped them only after the elite status was confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second-generation Mosi army gathered, and only a high-ranking priest accompanied the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary cannon fodder corps can't get this kind of high-end talents at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Differential treatment is comprehensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only medical resources, but also logistics supplies are very different between the elite army and the ordinary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the bread of the elite army, there is no sawdust or sand, it is nothing more than adding some vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention meat eating tube, but meat can still be seen every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every ten days, you can also receive a small piece of sucrose. Where conditions permit, some egg supplements can also be obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These treatments are not what the cannon fodder can expect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is because there are enough benefits that Hudson performed hard along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war ended, and the exhausted army naturally couldn't continue on the road. After cleaning the battlefield, choose a place nearby to set up camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As night fell, a heavy rain suddenly fell from the sky, and the rain washed away the blood on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only those half-burned corpses poured out the cruelty of war in the rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a luxurious tent, Hudson and a group of officers are busy counting the results and casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the fighting during the day, the Wrightshire Regiment suffered few casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early stage of the battle against the orc infantry, the heavy infantry stood in front, and the thick armor blocked most of the enemy's attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the cavalry battle, Hudson fired again, turning into a one-sided massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total number of casualties on both sides was no more than a few hundred, and the wounded slightly exceeded four digits. However, after the priests treated them, they have almost recovered now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, you only need to add some nutrition, and you can recover your combat effectiveness after a few days of cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the loss of the Moxi Army was even heavier. Although they beat the dog in the water, they still paid a high price in the face of the beleaguered enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not ask about the specific number of casualties. If you are not your own soldier, you will not feel bad when you die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the brilliant record, these casualties are not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more than 10,000 orc corpses found on the battlefield alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't care whether the torn corpses were double counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** scene is difficult to identify unless you observe it closely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of defeat all the way on the human battlefield, any victory is commendable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politicians from all over the world can't wait to expand their record tenfold, so no one will delve into these details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the fight, it was a fire, except for the fleeting record on the photo stone, there would be no evidence left at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captives do not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Race wars are cruel, either you die or I die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any soft-heartedness will have disastrous consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gaining tens of thousands is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc cannon fodder is worthless, and the elite cannon fodder, such a record will only be taken for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really deserves a special mention are the more than 400 corpses of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the five royal families of the orcs. After artistically processing the data, the credit book becomes the acquisition of the two thousand royal families of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson falsely reported his military exploits, it's purely due to the needs of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the Wrightshire Legion need military exploits, and the second generation of the Moshi Legion also need military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with this bit of military exploits, after dividing it up, you can't get too many substantive rewards, so it's good to brag about it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many orc cannon fodder have been beheaded, how can there be any momentum for beheading the orc royal family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cake is not enough, so we can only find a way to make it bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the testimony of corpses all over the floor, it is more convincing than mere bragging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the insufficient number of orc royal families, there is no rule that a corpse can only appear once on the photo stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turn over, turn sideways, make up a knife...you can record it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it roughly looks similar, it is enough to be able to take it out for publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of \"small\" modified data is beneficial to both the frontline soldiers and the politicians and bureaucrats in the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the final result of the battle. During the daytime battle, we defeated an army of 30,000 orcs and captured 11,367 orc heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killed 6,000 orc wolf cavalry, including 2,124 in the Silver Moon Wolf Clan War, beheading orc officers...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captured eight hundred swords, five hundred warhammers, and one hundred shields...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific details of the battle report are all on the parchment, so take a look!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no problem, then everyone should submit a joint report. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lied about his military achievements, his heart was still a little turbulent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson hated this kind of deception the most, but he had no choice but to become the person he hated the most in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, this battle report will be further modified and expanded after it is passed on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some names that do not appear on the credit book will also be added, and even ranked ahead of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no right or wrong, everything is due to practical needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi needs a big and exciting victory, and the expeditionary force also needs a big victory to get off to a good start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results calculated by everyone together, although the final number was cut by Hudson, are still enough to satisfy everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, bragging also has to consider the actual situation. If you blow your head too much, you will become a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obtaining two thousand orc royal families is acceptable to the outside world. If there are more, it will be easy to pass through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing everyone smiling, Hudson suddenly changed his tone and said solemnly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Although we don't know what happened on the front line, we haven't received any news about the tens of thousands of orcs appearing here. This is absolutely abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are guest troops, and we don't know much about the frontline terrain. Where can so many troops rush in without being discovered by the defenders? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if they were tortured by their souls, the faces of the second-generation children who were originally full of excitement suddenly turned ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not just a problem, it's clearly a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It must be that some **** on the front line are negligent. With so many orc troops crossing the border, the defenders cannot be ignorant!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I was lucky, and I acted with the Wrightshire Army to reinforce the front line. If they acted alone, it was unknown whether they would be able to save their lives, not to mention gaining military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the point is concerned, Hudson has no time to intervene in the internal affairs of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to be held accountable in the future is a matter for the Moxi people themselves. If it wasn't for a common enemy, he wouldn't bother to bring it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest in the middle of the night is already under curfew. Except for the sparse patrol team, it is already difficult to see people on the street.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sudden battle report from the front broke the tranquility of the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rough voice spread all the way into the palace. Wake up the sleeping Chris IX.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being interrupted in his dream, Chris IX was not annoyed at all, but had a smile on his face instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news\", this thing is really rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the fall of Fort Augustus, he has been surrounded by all kinds of bad news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He couldn't even sleep soundly, for fear that the orcs would attack him when he woke up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The princes and ministers who heard about the inquiry also hurriedly got up from the bed and rushed to the palace as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the practice of the Principality of Moxi, to be able to deliver the news with such fanfare must be a major victory on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind of small victory that beheaded thousands of children directly sent the victory report to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Just wait until the working hours of the next day, and then report, there is no need to be so heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The new 23rd Legion and the Alpha Kingdom's Wrightshire Legion jointly reported that they encountered an army of 30,000 orcs during the day and gained a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have already seen the battle scenes recorded by the Photo Stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected of the elite of the Alpha Kingdom, their fighting power is strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of equal strength, a frontal charge severely damaged an orc wolf cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A thousand cavalry chased thousands of orc wolf cavalry, and watching that scene made people excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the performance of our new 23rd Legion is also good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blocking the enemy's wolf cavalry from the front, it was the most glorious victory since the start of this war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the smile on Chris IX's face, everyone knows that the gains are not small.

Countless people were celebrating the victory. The joy of victory in the war dispelled the oppressive atmosphere in the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the battle took place in Yueluowan, the unexpected encounter also gained a famous name \"Yueluowan Victory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to boost morale, the official of the Principality of Moxi even directly announced that this is a turning point in the war between the human race and the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be called a \"turning battle\", and Hudson's battle report seems a bit petty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Need pictures as evidence, the number of beheadings has not increased much, but the number of orc troops encountered has directly expanded to 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After defeating an army of 100,000 orcs and beheading more than 10,000 heads, the weight of the \"great victory\" instantly changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any battle that defeats the enemy's 100,000 troops will be recorded in the annals of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi needs this victory, the second-generation family needs this victory, and Prince Caesar also needs this victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blow, but blow vigorously into the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the joint efforts of all parties, an ordinary encounter was quickly exaggerated into an \"epic victory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who was originally only a little famous, became famous in the first battle, and he seems to be a rising \"star star\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't know that he was passively famous, was worrying about the heavy rain outside at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the war that day began, heavy rain has been falling for three consecutive days. Even if it turns sunny occasionally, the muddy road is not suitable for the army to advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the soldiers dig pits in the rain to dispose of the corpses, Hudson was also very helpless. What was once a fire, now has to be buried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rain-soaked corpse decays at an unusually fast rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid the plague, only the most primitive method can be adopted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted Bear Stearns to help dig a hole, but he couldn't bear the resentful eyes of Uncle Xiong, so he had to give up in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason why this war was won so easily is that the two sides have unequal information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs had known about the existence of the Earth Bear in advance, they wouldn't have divided up their forces foolishly, and the battle still had to be fought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long the news can be concealed counts as long as it lasts, and as many people as can be deceived to death count as one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the relationship between the five royal families of the orcs, if this kind of thing happened, everyone would just cover it up tightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps some of the orcs who escaped realized that something was wrong, but the probability of being able to directly associate it with the Earth Bear is still not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless there is a traitor betrayed by the race, the existence of Bear Stearns will not spread among the orcs in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the eagle scouts that appeared above him from time to time, Hudson felt that it was better for Bear Stearns to show less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Working hard in the rain, although a little tired, has advantages and disadvantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, Master Hudson has had enough meat. The orc corpses need to be disposed of, but it does not affect everyone's consumption of war beast corpses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to preserve the meat delivered to the door, the camp was smoky for several days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unprofessional smoking and roasting techniques filled the camp with various smells, forcing Hudson to release magic to block the smell from entering his tent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems. For soldiers at the bottom of society, as long as they can eat meat, a little taste is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the continuous heavy rain, the marching date was passively delayed, and there was only one day left before the final deadline. Hudson didn't panic about this little problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no such encounter, then there is no other way, and we have to rush to the front line even in the rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military orders are like a mountain, even if it is a transnational operation, the basic rules of the game must still be followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different now, a sentence of \"deal with the battlefield\" is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took a long time to process the corpse, which also proved the brilliant results of this war from the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not forget to ask someone to take a picture of the scene of busy handling the corpse in front of him. These are good promotional materials, which can prove that he is a responsible nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these corpses are not disposed of properly, if a plague is triggered, the consequences will be serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the fragile Principality of Moxi, it cannot withstand any turmoil now, let alone a terrible plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a camp full of wolf-headed flags, an old man was kneeling on the ground tremblingly, bowing his head and waiting for the final judgment of fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Claudine, you have been with me for so many years, and you have made great contributions to the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for so many years, you have been able to complete the task cautiously, why do you still make such mistakes in your later years? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the words of the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor, Claudine's body trembled even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orcs don't believe in tears, all losers must pay for their own failures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the army into the hinterland of the Principality of Moxi this time, not only failed to complete the task assigned by the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor, but also ended up with annihilation of the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Committing such a serious crime, it cannot be justified without a decent explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this complete failure was an accident. No one thought that the Alpha Kingdom would send the most elite troops here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all those **** Eagles who didn't deliver the information on time, and we accidentally encountered the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our soldiers are very brave, they are still unable to hold on in the face of the enemy's absolute strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Your Majesty can rest assured that we have not shamed the royal family. On the battlefield, everyone was very brave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I didn't want to pass the news back, I would fight to the death and choose to wash it away with blood...”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Claudine struggled hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the punishment for himself, he also went all out. On the one hand, he exaggerated the strength of the Wright County Army, and on the other hand, he blamed the Eagles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these are not enough, excuses are just excuses after all, and they must be approved by the wolf emperor in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the old man indifferently, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor who was sitting above came down, and said in a cold tone: \"Okay, I already know everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say I'm unfeeling, I won't leave you a chance. After causing such a big disaster, there must be an explanation for all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, everyone will follow suit in the future. Wouldn't our Silver Moon Wolf Clan go into decline?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Ni said, humiliation can only be washed away with blood. After a few days of rest, go to the crime camp to report! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the words of the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor, Claudine froze. Blood washes away shame, that's just talk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really wanted to go all out, he wouldn't run back. He stayed directly to fight against the human army, and finally died on the battlefield with his soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orcs advocate blood, and there is no shame in dying on the battlefield. Those who shed blood on the battlefield are all warriors, and no one will cling to the fault of the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thanks, Your Majesty!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Claudine replied with a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has always been a saying in the Yinyue Wolf Clan: Once you enter the \"crime camp\", life and death are beyond your control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is necessary to use blood to atone for sin, it is natural to undertake the most bitter and dangerous task. Therefore, the casualty rate of officers and soldiers in the \"crime camp\" has remained high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is common to suffer heavy losses. If the war situation is in trouble, it is nothing new for the criminal camp to be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how dangerous the crime camp is, it is better than directly investigating the responsibility for the defeat. If luck is good enough, after ten battles, if you are still alive, you will be able to come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No time to pay attention to the complicated thoughts of his subordinates. Being able to show mercy outside the law without directly chopping off Claudine's head, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor felt that he was enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing 10,000 to 20,000 troops, the Silver Moon Wolf Clan can afford it. The problem is that the original plan failed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, the five royal families sent troops together to cross the enemy's defense line, detour into the rear and storm the capital of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan is very good, but the risk is also very large. This kind of high-risk work, everyone is reluctant to take risks with their main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team led by Claudine is the best example. Because I met the wrong person at the wrong time, I ended up with a near-annihilated end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team that set off together is far more than just this one team. But the operation has just begun, and there is a lack of one-fifth of the strength of the Yinyue Wolf Clan, so everyone can only withdraw passively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to force the main force of the enemy to come out of the fortress for a decisive battle, you must first be able to besiege the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't even touch the city of Da Pest, and end up with annihilation first, that would be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cannon fodder troops are also an important force on the battlefield. If one hundred thousand and eighty thousand were accompanied in one go, the five imperial courts would also feel pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is not only for consumption, but more importantly, to realize their strategic plan to weaken the human race and strengthen themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the months of hard fighting against the Alpha Kingdom, they killed tens of thousands of defenders, and their own casualties were only a few hundred thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing a hundred thousand troops just for a plan that doesn't know whether it will succeed or fail, no matter how strong the family is, it can't stand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the sudden encounter made the five royal families of the orcs somewhat confused. For a while, the strength of the human race was predicted, and there was another disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Alpha Kingdom was able to mobilize a main army to support its allies in the bitter battle, who can guarantee that the Principality of Moxi will not have the main force to stay in the capital?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't take much, just a main army and a group of miscellaneous soldiers can keep the army they sent out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are two main armies and three or four ordinary armies, a counterattack can be organized. There is no need to call back troops from the front line to help them out, and they can be driven out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Yinyue wolf clan that led to the bankruptcy of the plan, they were suddenly pushed to the forefront, and various criticisms followed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor was also secretly thinking about whether or not he should send his elite to take a risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the sudden heavy rain, which covered up the traces of the army's retreat, their strategic plan was not really exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army that was only lost by the Silver Moon Wolf Clan would at most be considered to have been sent there to make trouble. After all, an army of 20,000 orcs is not qualified to attack the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the adventure plan is successful, the previous failures are not a problem. Not only will all the criticism disappear without a trace, but a lot of prestige can also be gained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the plan fails, the consequences will be very serious. Although the elites of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan are not as rare as Beamon, they are not that many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are accidentally bitten by the enemy and lose tens of thousands of people at once, you will also feel pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What will happen in the future, no one knows. If you suffer heavy losses in the adventure at this moment, and then unfortunately suffer heavy losses, you will not have a good life in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire has never been peaceful. If too many main forces are lost on the battlefield, the Silver Moon Wolf Clan's voice in the five imperial courts will inevitably decline significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky, you may be kicked off the throne of the royal family and lose the power to control your own destiny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be perfect if the other four royal families could be mobilized to dispatch elites to carry out this adventure plan together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor felt that he seemed to be doing it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adventures are not terrible, and heavy losses are not terrible. The terrible thing is that their family lost, but others did not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the ebb and flow, the balance is broken, and that is the beginning of the disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, after the ardent publicity, a new problem was placed in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Epic Victory\" was blown out, and rewards became a big problem. Especially when joint operations between the two countries are involved, there are more issues to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Chris IX suddenly understood why the treatment of so many epic heroes in history did not match their own merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it wasn't just because of jealousy that they deliberately lowered their rewards, but a large part of their outstanding achievements were blown out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a random guess. There are too many similarities between what is recorded in the history books and what is happening now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the villains and dignitaries who have been criticized for countless years, Chris IX trembled. He didn't want to get his name in life and after because of a political propaganda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, do you have any suggestions for rewarding the heroes?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A king who can't throw blame is definitely not a good king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't break the rules, give rewards that exceed the actual military exploits, and don't want to be mistreated by future generations, so Chris IX will naturally blame him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, my second son is also on the list of meritorious officials. I need to avoid suspicion regarding the reward.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Avoid suspicion\", this reason is really perfect. Anyone who listens can only praise the prime minister for his integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Chris IX could speak, a bunch of princes and nobles came out and said: their children are on the list of heroes, and they need to avoid suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Chris IX, who was originally worried, suddenly lit up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal operations, lowering the rewards for the heroes will definitely cause criticism among the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to the younger generations of princes and nobles, the situation will be different if they are pressured by their parents and elders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't say too much, regarding the matter of awarding meritorious officials, there must be a result today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will leave this matter to you. As long as everyone does it fairly and strictly, I believe no one will criticize it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They are all old politicians from the aristocratic circle, and they can see the real purpose of Chris IX at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Propaganda can be expanded, but military merit evaluation cannot cross the line. This is the foundation of the Principality of Moxi, and it must not be broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Absurdity is after all blown out, fooling ordinary people, but not fooling those in power above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the generals on the front line or the princes and nobles in the rear, you can see the moisture in it at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to give a convincing result, many things will be difficult to handle later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, my descendants are all descendants of the kingdom.

They have no obligation to fight for the kingdom, and they must be rewarded heavily as an incentive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is no longer possible to find cheap ones. Then you must reflect the \"high character and integrity\" side. Prestige is never too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king handed over the matter of rewards to them, which meant that military merit could only be suppressed, and could not be extended beyond the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a pragmatic nobleman, Prime Minister Herceg's idea is very simple. Nominal rewards may be omitted, but substantial benefits must be obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is not over yet, talking about fiefdoms is bullshit. Borderlands is basically on the front line, who knows if it can be taken back from the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the obtained fief falls into the hands of the orcs and cannot be recovered, and becomes a short lord, wouldn't it be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, although the military achievements this time are great, there are too many people who can't stand to share them. So many second generations are divided up together, and there are only a few who fall on everyone's head in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold, silver, jewellery, beauties in fragrant cars, they are no shortage of great nobles. It's better to accumulate military merits there first, and settle them together after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these tasteless rewards, it is better to take the opportunity to seek a higher military position and obtain substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't mention it directly, because Prime Minister Herceg had no idea about his son's ability. Promotion is a good thing, but now is a time of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ability and position do not match, it is easy to cause accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly formed 23rd Legion was able to stop the orcs from breaking out, not only because of the smooth wind, but also the guards arranged by each family for the younger generations also played an important role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the military merits of outsiders like the Wright County Legion are easier to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In the Wrightshire Legion, are there any nobles who want to obtain fiefdoms in our Principality of Moxi?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elite troops, everyone is greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can dig the foot of the Alpha Kingdom, he will definitely not be stingy with rewards. Even if the rewards are heavier, everyone can understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are no fiefdoms, and most of them are concentrated in the border areas now. Some people are willing to go to the mines, and everyone is happy to relax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have already contacted these nobles secretly. Maybe it is hard to leave the homeland, and the final result is not optimistic.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato replied slightly embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is really working hard, but unfortunately everyone is doing well in the Alpha Kingdom, and there is no thought of changing jobs at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is a fool. Everyone avoids the land in the northern border of the Alpha Kingdom. How could it be possible to come over to guard the border for the Principality of Moxi?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the promised fief, which is still in the hands of the orc army, it is unknown whether it can be taken back, let alone the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning around and sighing, Chris IX said angrily: \"Forget it, since they don't want to come over, then forget it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was passed on, and Crown Prince Caesar was conferred the title of Earl of Fort Augustus, and Hudson was conferred the title of Earl of Moonfall Bay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the nobles, you look at the titles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, prepare some wine and food to serve the army, and the treasury allocates 200,000 gold coins to give rewards to the officers and soldiers on the front line. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that such a generous reward must be an honorary nobleman. Although the place name was brought, it was only to show \"glory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to become a real earl, unless you really fight the \"turning war\" in the propaganda, or severely damage the orc army on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to accumulate military merits, you need to accumulate at least a dozen times to have any hope of winning at this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the threshold is high, it's that land resources are limited. In a situation where there are many monks and few meat, the competition is naturally fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to lower this threshold, unless the situation of the war further erodes, there will be more unclaimed lands in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this is also the biggest drawback of the noble military title system. When it develops to a certain level, there will be no land to seal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs hadn't broken through the defense line of Fort Augustus and harmed the nobles in the large land to the north, the Principality of Moxi wouldn't even be able to get a decent fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the propaganda battle report of the Principality of Moxi back to China as soon as possible, and copy a copy for the remaining legions to read.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone received the order together. The Wrightshire Legion has already made great achievements, but they are still dawdling on the road. What kind of talk is this! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was dissatisfied with Hudson's behavior of treating him as a drag, it did not affect his joy for the victory on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the supreme commander of the Alpha Kingdom's expeditionary force, he is responsible for all the victories on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, if the troops under his command suffer a defeat, he also has his responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To promote the victory of the Wrightshire Regiment was to promote himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he doesn't tell about the small change that happened before, no one will know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of interests, a little unpleasantness is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of worrying about these details, it is better to turn passive into active, and let this war become a booster for his prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, the seeds of Caesar's unwillingness are also sprouting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson dared to be tough in front of him, it was because the Wright County Army could fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, arrogant soldiers and powerful generals have not been so easy to command. Everyone has expected it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you switch to an ordinary army, you won't have the confidence. Dare to **** in front of the commander, and the shoes will be put on in minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Constantly urging the subsequent legions to speed up, it was because Crown Prince Caesar had no soldiers at hand. No matter how many ideas I have in my mind, I don't have the ability to implement them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, according to your will, the six legions will be renumbered. At present, the Second and Third Legions of the Expeditionary Army have entered the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current marching speed, they will be able to reach the capital within five days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Fourth Army Corps has also arrived at the border, and is expected to arrive within ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the remaining two legions is slightly slower. It is estimated that in half a month, they will also be able to reach the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other countries, this speed is actually not too slow. You must know that reinforcements are still on the way to the nearest Principality of Orton. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a close minister of the royal family, he doesn't want to see the crown prince fall out with the nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the response speed of the latter legions was indeed a bit slower, it was also due to their special circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the improvised team, the people below have also worked hard to achieve the current speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously a cannon fodder army, insisting on demanding others with the standards of an elite army, isn't this deliberately embarrassing others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marching speed was second, and what he was most worried about was that Crown Prince Caesar would use the cannon fodder army as an elite army in order to show off his abilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reaction of the royal family, we can see that if the king thinks that the crown prince has military capabilities, how could he not equip a direct army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is essentially that the king has no confidence in the military capabilities of the crown prince, and he is reluctant to bring out the elite to make him suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sent here to gain reputation, in essence, he used the noble private army as a guinea pig to experiment with his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you succeed, you will earn blood. If you fail, you will lose a few cannon fodder, and the Alpha Kingdom can afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan is correct, but it can't stand the rapid changes in the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Wrightshire Legion has made a good start and has already gained popularity for Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, what is most needed is not to make persistent efforts and create greater glories, but to stabilize the results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you act blindly and cause a big defeat, the previous achievements will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the royal family needs to cultivate is a king's heir, not the so-called military god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military merit is just an embellishment on the King's Road. A keen political sense and mature political skills are what the crown prince needs most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps I'm too impatient, the situation on the front line of the Principality of Moxi is worse than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of thousands of orc troops broke in, but the defenders failed to report the news in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's the noble officers on the front line who are negligent, or the bureaucrats in the royal capital have a problem. In short, this is very dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there were not many orcs coming this time, and they happened to be hit by the Wrightshire Legion, which cut out the hidden dangers in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs dispatched an army of 100,000 to 80,000 and sneaked in secretly, the defenders on the front line still don't know anything, where do you think they will attack?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than two hundred years ago, I, the Alpha Kingdom, met once! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about the military ability, no one has the opportunity to go to the battlefield, no one knows what level it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Caesar has memorized the history books fluently since he was a child. When I ran into a familiar plot, I naturally had an association.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the royal family grew up, and they still have political acumen. When he found something was wrong, he didn't report it to the Principality of Moxi immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of invisible matter, the reminder is right, and there is not much credit, and the reminder is wrong, and it is easy to attract complaints.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these days were spent in the Principality of Moxi happily, Caesar still did not forget his identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, you want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through the words, Count Jose swallowed back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the risk of this plan is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if the guess is wrong, no one will know anyway, so just pretend nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the judgment is correct, the opportunity to draw millet from the fire has indeed come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is, with their strength, can they really turn the tide?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of a misoperation, the Principality of Moxi was directly killed by the orcs, and the orc army drove straight in, and the Alpha Kingdom had to face greater pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, such a good opportunity, how can we not try it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi was seriously insufficiently prepared for the orc invasion. Even now, many people have not changed their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the gap in strength between the two sides, it is still unknown whether the defense will survive for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are only more than 600,000 orcs on the front line, this number is increasing every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the reinforcements promised by various countries are all in place on time, it will last an extra month or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't take risky moves and find opportunities to weaken the strength of the orcs, it will only be a matter of time before the Principality of Moxi collapses. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar said happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After coming to the front line for so long, this was the first time he found a fighter plane. If he didn't give it a try, he would really be unwilling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was not so confident, but the victory of the Wrightshire Army strengthened his determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the strength of the next few legions is greatly reduced, they are still soldiers who have been trained for more than a year, and their combat effectiveness is still somewhat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combining the strength of the six legions, joining forces with the Mosi people, and adding reinforcements from nearby countries that are about to arrive, it is still very possible to succeed in eating the orc army that is alone and deep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the plan fails, Dapez will not fall in a short time, and countries still have a chance to rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of a substantive threat can also allow the ethnic alliance to make a rescue decision as soon as possible to a certain extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, it is best to consult the Hudson Army Commander for this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to encircle and wipe out the orc army that has gone deep into the lone army, among the troops we can mobilize, the most effective one is the First Legion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the scene described by Caesar is indeed very tempting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention direct annihilation, even if it is just defeating the orc army that has penetrated alone, they will be able to reap huge political benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending charcoal in the snow is always better than icing on the cake. If the Principality of Moxi is not in danger, how can they highlight their importance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that for some reason, he always feels that he has no idea. Deep in his heart, there is always a voice telling him: be cautious, be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rain, the sky cleared, and looking at the rainbow rising in the sky, Hudson decided to stay in place for another day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the muddy road is really not suitable for marching. Even if the soldiers can hold on, the vehicles can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has complained more than once about the way of the Mosi people. This is the lifeline of traffic leading to the front line, and it is actually a pure natural dirt road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, muddy roads are not a big problem at all. But now is a time of war, and bad roads will directly affect logistics and transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to complain, even if you want to build roads at this time, it's too late in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The summer flames are poisonous enough, and the muddy road is almost dry after a day in the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the potholed ground, there is only one way to repair it. Anyway, that's how everyone came here, Moxi people are not in a hurry, and he doesn't bother to be a villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Legion Commander, a group of Mosi soldiers escorting supplies appeared outside, and it is said that they are here to work for the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The members of the newly formed 23rd Legion have confirmed their identities, and now they are waiting for you to preside over the overall situation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the chief guard said, Hudson nodded slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a big victory, how could the Principality of Moxi not express it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treat meritorious ministers lightly, who will work hard in the future!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without too much delay, Hudson appeared outside the tent after changing into a military uniform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the army of soldiers who are half covered in mud, it is impossible to say that they are not moved at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the situation, the labor force must have come here in the rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Work can achieve this step, which is enough to prove that the princes and nobles above attach great importance to this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The feeling of being valued is always refreshing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Ordinary auxiliary resources don't mean much to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real gain is that the Principality of Moxi agreed to equip the Wrightshire Army with a part of the magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to think about it, it's the credit of those second generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous battle report, Hudson praised them severely, and most of the falsely reported military exploits were put on the heads of these second generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you take advantage, you will naturally give something in return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the manufacturing process of the magic crossbow is cumbersome, it is still possible for a country to make it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not equipped on a large scale, mainly because of cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, such an expensive guy would only be equipped to the main army of the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an excess quota, it will be the turn of other troops. Every time there is a mad grab.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Wrightshire Legion is able to take food from a tiger's mouth. In addition to the impact of military achievements, it is more important to have someone to help it operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to be remembered by Hudson is not only because of the long-range lethality of the magic crossbow, but also the air defense capability of this thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adjust the shooting angle well, and it also has a strong strike ability against air targets. It can be regarded as one of the few anti-aircraft firepower in this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the magic crystal cannon is even more powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the thing is not only expensive, but also surprisingly bulky. Even the lightest magic crystal cannon weighs several tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The powerful heavy-duty magic crystal cannon weighs tens of tons, or even hundreds of tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is okay to defend the city, but it is a disaster to equip it to field troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What matches the body size is the power. The hundreds of tons of heavy magic crystal cannons are said to be able to injure giant dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it is only \"supposedly\" that under normal circumstances, the shells fired by such a big guy can't hit the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is covered by dense firepower, it is impossible for humans to adjust the speed of aiming at the muzzle to catch up with the moving speed of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossbow arrows are slightly less powerful, but they are smaller in size and relatively flexible in operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some special magic bed crossbows made by master alchemists also have a certain lethality against high-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why masters have to run away from the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-level monsters can be injured, how can a fragile human body withstand it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a quota, when the goods can be obtained, it depends on the efficiency of the bureaucrats of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not worried about this problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of new friends I just made, the efficiency of the bureaucrats in the capital is destined not to be low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the two sides have made an appointment, and everyone will act together in the next mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military merit is one aspect, but the most important thing is that the Wrightshire Army has a high degree of autonomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, Hudson can refuse all unreasonable tasks assigned by the frontline command at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in danger, leave the mission and run away, the Principality of Moxi has no right to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be held accountable, the lawsuit must go to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a team with great achievements, as long as they don't make mistakes of principle, they will basically be fined three drinks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following such teammates to act together, other things cannot be determined, but the safety is definitely much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happens, you can shirk responsibility reasonably. The question is: the liaison officer must move with the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is working well, as long as you are not stupid, you will not stare at a group of tough guys in the background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Raquel, have you investigated the orc army crossing the border, is there any result now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is going to the front line soon, and he is really worried if he doesn't figure out this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humans and orcs are at odds with each other, and the chances of the defenders colluding with orcs are not high. But no one can guarantee that there will not be a few idiots among the officers and soldiers at the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this kind of idiot is in an important position, it will be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, this issue is very complicated. All frontline troops are conducting self-examination, and I believe the results will be available soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal capital has issued a strict order to strengthen the guards of the frontline officers and soldiers. Similar things should never happen again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lackel's answer left Hudson wondering what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unbelievable that such a big thing has happened, but it is still allowed to \"self-examine\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to his understanding, once this kind of thing happens, it is right to directly start accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many orc hordes crossing the line, it's impossible not to leave a trail. Where a person passes is the responsibility of the local defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is understandable that the defenders could not stop them from bypassing the fortress, but it is impossible to justify it if they do not report it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After checking layer by layer, following the clues for a few days, there should be a rough result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is not easy for Hudson to intervene too much in the housework of the Principality of Moxi. He could only secretly raise his vigilance in the next actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest, Crown Prince Caesar is reluctantly saying goodbye to Princess Anne. After these days of contact, the distance between the two of them as a couple is only a layer of window paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally wanted to invite Princess Anne to go on a \"hunting outing\" together, but unfortunately, a good girl who was well educated by the royal family, how could she agree to such an outrageous invitation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of this matter, the two had a lot of conflicts. In Princess Anne's view, the country is in a dangerous period, so it's fine if you can't help, how can you add to the chaos!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out for an outing and hunting seems like nothing, but once the \"crown prince status\" is applied, everything becomes extraordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bureaucrats along the way will inevitably have to be busy for a while. Maybe it will affect the efficiency of raising strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was the prince of the Principality of Moxi, someone would have stepped forward to persuade him to leave. However, Crown Prince Caesar is a guest, and he came here to help out. The Principality of Moxi couldn't refuse such a small request.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make Princess Anne happy, Crown Prince Caesar had an idea, and directly changed the pre-made excuses, turning the outing and hunting into integrating troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the Wright County Legion participating in the war, the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force also had five legions. As the commander-in-chief to coordinate and command, it is completely in line with the identity and personality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't go to the battlefield!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not wrong, the Principality of Moxi has the same position as Hudson, and they don't want Crown Prince Caesar to go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed common for a king to lead an army to an expedition, but the prerequisite is that the king has excellent military quality and the ability to command thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have superhuman military command ability, don't go to the front line to join in the fun and add chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the three northern monarchs who suffered from the orcs together did a very good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My military command ability is average, so I stay behind to raise supplies, so that nobles who are capable of commanding the army will go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason why the Three Kingdoms have been able to survive the siege of the orc army until now is that the monarchs of the Three Kingdoms did not go to the front line to die, allowing the generals to freely display their military capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A successful case is also the biggest obstacle for Crown Prince Caesar to go to the front line. No one welcomes him, a commander with unknown abilities, who ran to the front line to command blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Caesar is a man with dreams, always wanting to surpass his father and prove his ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the more he wants to go to the front line, the harder it is for him to realize his dream of commanding the army to make contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson refused to take him, and the deputy commander around him was also blocking him, and the hosts of the Principality of Moxi were also trying their best to keep him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on whether the next few legions are willing to buy it. If these people also follow suit, the general dream of Crown Prince Caesar will be completely shattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stepped out of the city of Dapace and joined the oncoming Second Legion, Crown Prince Caesar received the warmest welcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an endless stream of nobles who come to flatter every day. I felt comfortable for the first two days, but Caesar soon noticed something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that these people regard flattering him as more important than commanding the army. Being valued is one thing, but putting the cart before the horse is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this time I came here to fight, not to accept flattery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince of the Alpha Kingdom, he has grown up under all kinds of compliments since he was a child, and he has long been immune to these low-level flattering techniques.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what is going on with the Second Legion, why is it so much worse than the First Legion?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar asked with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being pestered and visited by a group of little nobles every day, he was also exhausted. Several times of persuasion, still can't stop everyone's enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he missed the Wrightshire Legion instead. Not only is he good at fighting, but he is also well-behaved enough to know his status and will not cause him any trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, this is the gap between an elite army and an ordinary army. Not only in military training, but also in the command system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that so many aristocratic officers came to visit without knowing how to measure, actually reflects that Viscount Andres' control over the army is far less than that of Earl Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also very simple to solve the current troubles. As long as you shut the door and say goodbye for a while, these guys will naturally understand what you mean. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose calmly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from Crown Prince Caesar who only had a photo with the Second Legion once, Jose has dealt with these troops and knows very well the strength of each legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the Second Legion is considered good. After all, it is a noble from a county, and Viscount Andres can still control the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't prevent a group of nobles from coming to visit Crown Prince Caesar, it's just that he is smooth and doesn't like to offend people for unnecessary things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two legions at the bottom of the back are a hodgepodge of mixed fish and dragons. The internal chain of command, that's the chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of troops is destined to follow suit. Once the battle situation is unfavorable, collapse is a matter of minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because he knows so much that Earl Jose is not optimistic about Crown Prince Caesar's grand plan. It's a pity that his arms can't hold his thighs, and as a royal retainer, he can't afford to offend the future king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we can only hope that after seeing the poor performance of the next few regiments, the Crown Prince Caesar will wake up and give up this unreliable plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, let someone put up an announcement outside, saying that I am going to retreat and practice, and I haven't seen any outsiders recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, inform Viscount Andres, let him take advantage of these few days of rest to pull the team out for a good training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current state of the Second Legion, if they encounter elite orcs, they will suffer a lot. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to stand a group of barons and knights pestering him for visits, he was forced to close the door to thank the guests, which is also a historical precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the aftereffect of Corporal Li Xian not learning the essence. They overestimated the self-knowledge of the nobles at the bottom and ignored their utilitarianism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Friends have more roads to travel, and since getting along with the Moxi nobles, Hudson can get more information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that Crown Prince Caesar left Da Pest and ran to join the follow-up troops quickly reached his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that his worried crown prince was probably planning some big plan now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not receive the notice, and Hudson was happy to play dumb. If you don't know, you don't need to take responsibility for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle that one thing more is worse than one thing less, I simply didn't bother to mix it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army slowly advanced, looking at the looming city of Terence, Hudson's thoughts had already flown there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the front line of the Principality of Moxi against the orc army, the importance of Terence City is self-evident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategic value is important, which means to suffer the worst beating. Ever since the orc army advanced, the flames of war in Terence City have never ceased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The days of wars have made the defenders numb. Even the good news of the arrival of reinforcements failed to boost everyone's morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at a group of soldiers who looked like walking corpses standing on the tall city wall, Hudson couldn't help frowning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the superior officers of these soldiers are not qualified. In such a situation, you must first appease the army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against the army of orcs on the battlefield every day, I have to tense my nerves all the time, and normal people have to suffer from illness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can I do without psychological counseling?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is to understand the righteousness of the human race, to directly reward the soldiers, or to directly draw cakes for the soldiers, they are all solutions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, people must have hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same is true for an army. Only an army full of hope can erupt the strongest combat effectiveness on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, psychological counseling is not popular in the continent of Aslante. The aristocratic lords who are high above can't care about the emotions of the soldiers at the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the current state of many noble officers is similar to these soldiers. They are all holding the idea of ​​​​one day at a time, and have no hope for the future at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome Earl Hudson to Terence City!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On behalf of the 400,000 defenders on the front line, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for coming all the way to support us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    May the great Lord of Dawn bless you, and the friendship between our two countries will last forever...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standardized welcome mode just subtracts some extravagance and simplifies the welcome ceremony in an all-round way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene fell into Hudson's eyes. Not only was he not angry, but he felt relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally met a pragmatic commander, it was really not easy. If the upper echelons of the frontline troops pay attention to formalism like the dignitaries in the capital, then there is really no hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Being able to mobilize troops to come over for reinforcements is all about taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Warhammer are also facing the threat of orcs. It is not easy to fulfill the ally's obligation to send reinforcements, and to expect more is to embarrass others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few neighbors are not much better. For example, the Principality of Orton next to it has a standing army of only 10,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was announced that 70,000 troops would be dispatched, but in fact, they managed to scrape together 30,000 reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The neighboring country of Ruilin performed even better. Soon after receiving the request for help, it announced the mobilization of the whole country, calling for the support of the whole country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mobilization is real, and support is also available. Just listen to the political slogan of national power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only an army of 10,000 people, but it was still sent out. Although due to various reasons, the efficiency has slowed down a little bit, the reinforcements have now arrived at the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, the Terran nations in the northern region have basically announced national mobilization and promised to send reinforcements to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, with the strength of a group of people and countries in the northern region, it is absolutely possible to fight a decisive battle with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that this is not an addition problem of 1+1=2. If there are too many people, there will be more problems. A group of countries are calling for mobilization and support, but few are really willing to contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One by one the slogans were shouted earth-shatteringly, and in the end they were put into action. They were all preserving their strength and imagining that others would contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, it is a miracle that half of the 500,000 reinforcements advertised by various countries can be in place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't understand the principle of cold lips and teeth, but the problem is that they can't help themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rushed forward in a daze, and wiped out all his family assets. Will he be able to survive the rest of his life?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc camp, the five royal families gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor suggested playing with a big one, everyone's expressions became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feint and strong attack are not the same concept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the previous plan, mainly through the siege of Dapes City, to lure the main force of the Principality of Moxi to come out for a decisive battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the plan fails, at most some cannon fodder troops will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if it is changed to storming the city of Dapace, that is another matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can sit here are not naive, and no one will take it for granted that the capital of the Mosi people is completely unarmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aside from other things, the private army of the princes and nobles in Guangcheng cannot be captured in a short while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention there are city guards, palace guards, mage colleges, chambers of commerce...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the juncture of life and death, the human race never lacks blood and courage, and the city of Dapace can definitely temporarily pull tens of thousands of young and strong people to the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The previous actions have already aroused the vigilance of the Moxi people. Now the defenders on their border have stepped up their guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once our people cross the line, they will immediately light up the smoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a large army, it is almost impossible to sneak in secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the front line to the city of Pest, the journey in the middle is more than two hundred miles. Once everyone crosses the line, it is only a matter of time before they are exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to catch them by surprise, unless all cavalry or air troops are dispatched, it will be difficult to work. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eagle Emperor said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his expression, it can be seen that he has no interest in attacking Da Pest City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to dispatch cavalry and air force. The problem is, who will be responsible for the next siege after launching a sneak attack?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never let the precious cavalry and airmen take up arms and exchange lives with the enemy defenders!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the city defense cannot be captured immediately, it will turn into a strong attack next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city of Terence in front of us has not been taken down for many days of continuous attack, so how can we guarantee that the city of Dapac will be defeated in one battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is difficult to storm Dapace, so we should besiege it. It seems dangerous to go deep alone, but as long as we change our thinking, the situation will change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality of Moxi is flat, and the territory is most suitable for cavalry to gallop. As long as we want, we can completely burn the flames of war to their hinterland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, their autumn harvest is about to begin. The fields are full of wheat waves, and the problem of food can be replenished on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While attacking the city of Dapes, they divided up their troops and plundered all directions, destroying the enemy's autumn harvest. As long as the enemy's logistics are destroyed, it is only a matter of time before the enemy army collapses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be on the safe side, I suggest that you call in some of the main force to watch the Mosi defenders in Terence City. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor slowly suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worried about being cut off from the back, it's just because there are too few elite troops in hand. If there are a few more, it is completely possible to suppress the enemy troops on the front line and launch an attack at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, after receiving the good news from the Principality of Moxi, Caesar III was all red.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not easy. After fighting for so long, there is finally a clean victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this victory was accomplished by the army commanded by the crown prince, so it will give him even more face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the specific details of the battle, that is not important at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi people can use it for publicity, and so can the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much moisture there is in the record, the battle scenes recorded by the Photo Stone can never be faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince is not on the front line. He is a proper general who sits hundreds of miles away and strategizes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally intended to be gilded for prestige, so we can't really let the crown prince go to the front line, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs never followed the rules. If the crown prince died on the front line, it would be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I feel better, I can do everything happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the situation on the side of the Moxi people stable now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified king, he was not blinded by a victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Yueluowan Great Victory\" seems to have achieved a lot, but for the huge orc empire, it actually only plucked a few hairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real meaning is not how many enemies are killed, but to boost morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the internal problems of the Principality of Moxi may be bigger than we expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because they have not experienced the pain of subjugation and genocide, there is still a gap between the central government of the Principality of Moxi and the local powerful nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is peace on the surface, but secretly they are still fighting non-stop. The orc army has crossed the border and penetrated deeply. So far, no one has been found out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But generally speaking, the situation is still developing for the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, the First Legion of the Expeditionary Army should have arrived in Terence City by now, and the remaining legions have also entered the Principality of Moxi one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Principality of Orton have also entered the Principality of Moxi recently, and the reinforcements from the Principality of Fick and the Earl of Ruilin will also arrive in the near future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many troops added, it shouldn't be a big problem to stabilize the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most worrying thing is their logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly increased more than a dozen or two hundred thousand troops, and the consumption of food and grass is not a small sum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the Principality of Moxi has a strong family and can support it financially, but how to transport things to the front line is a big problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said with deep emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom has accumulated so much experience, in order to raise food and supplies, there are still many problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time the Principality of Moxi has encountered such a thing. Even if there is no shortage of money, food and materials, coordinating the transportation work is still a hassle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the army is in place, but the logistics don't catch up in time, then it will be a lot of fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let Chris IX slowly trouble himself with these problems!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They also made preparations before the war. The front-line reserves can last for a few months, and there should be no accidents in the short term. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allies are used to block knives. Since the orcs dispersed part of their firepower to the Principality of Moxi, life in the Alpha Kingdom has been much easier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, there has been basically no news of the fall of the front-line fortress. Occasionally, the defenders would go out to fight wildly, killing a few orcs for fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alpha Kingdom, the longer the good times last, the better, and it is best to delay until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is a piece of news that you may want to prepare for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, the relationship between His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Princess Anne of the Principality of Moxi is somewhat unusual. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Earl Francis reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The marriage of the royal family is not only a matter of the two families, but also a matter of the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the crown prince who is the heir to the throne, marriage needs to be more cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This relationship has just begun, and it was discovered by the dispatched officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and reported back along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When the children grow up, we, the parents, can't help them. Let them pursue happiness by themselves!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III pretended to be hearty and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who didn't know thought he was more open-minded, but in fact it was because this well-matched marriage was in the interests of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the target pursued by the crown prince is not some Princess Moxi, but a singer, I am afraid he will be blown up immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, if you want to \"pursue happiness\", there is also a threshold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prelude to the publicity kicked off, and Hudson, the front-line commander, became famous along with the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the southeast province, it caused the most commotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have heard of Hudson's reputation for a long time, but this record is too good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the official document sent by Wangdu, many people were stunned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Viscount Cayo, who was shocked the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others don't know what the Wrightshire Legion is, so can his neighbor still not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the nobles in Wright County worked harder when training soldiers, but there is still a long way to go to say they are elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was skeptical when he originally went out with the name of an elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his opinion, the real elite is Hudson's private army, and the rest of the noble troops are the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I'm jealous of Hudson, and it doesn't involve my own interests, so I didn't expose it at the expense of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, after going out for a walk, the Wrightshire Army has not only become a true elite, but also has a record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the battle scene on the photo stone, Viscount Cayo was greatly shocked. At this moment, he had to admit that the Wrightshire Army could really fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, he felt depressed for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps others will suspect that the overall military quality of the nobles in Wright County is high, which is why they have trained such an elite army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he knew in his heart that the nobles in Wright and Wyton counties were all the same. The overall quality is not exactly the same, but the composition is surprisingly consistent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the soldiers trained by others, and then at the soldiers trained by himself, at this moment he fell into deep self-doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Catch up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This unreliable idea was just born, but he dismissed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary people should not compare with geniuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as the days of studying at the Magic Academy, he accepted the fact that he was an ordinary person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that after he came back to inherit the title, he received more praise and gradually lost himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until I encountered several setbacks later that I slowly returned to rationality and rediscovered myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put down the photo stone, Kayo sighed helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He knew that from now on, the guy who was once regarded as a competitor would become an existence he looked up to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have a higher background, it is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troubled times are the best time to break the hierarchy, everything is possible here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he has seen the birth of a legend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he suddenly worried about the fate of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on here, why is there moldy food in the barracks?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked almost roaring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that expression, it seems that he wants to eat people. The quartermaster was so frightened that he backed away again and again, unable to speak for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that no matter where they go, these quartermasters have always been offered by others, and they have never been treated like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to make a fuss, do you still want military supplies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like Hudson, who doesn't understand the rules and doesn't even prepare a gift, he can only receive moldy food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After accepting the beating, Lengtouqing will slowly accept the reality and follow their rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this time, it seems a little different. The person in front of him has no intention of discussing it at all, and will turn his face as soon as he comes up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seemingly remembering that this is his territory, the quartermaster who came back to his senses mustered up the courage to step forward and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, maybe it's raining and moldy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is all an accident, and there is nothing we can do about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food is like this now, you should take it quickly, don't waste your time here! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this, Hudson smiled slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is a local nobleman of the Principality of Moxi, he will really worry about encountering a quartermaster who is going up and down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, someone has deducted your rations, or else use them as a snack pad for your stomach!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words fell, a five-meter-tall giant bear appeared in front of him, grinning hoarsely at the quartermaster in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing? Guards, guards...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the quartermaster shouted, no one acted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the shroud of the gravity field, the surrounding soldiers were all overwhelmed, let alone moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the kick hit the iron plate, the quartermaster who collapsed on the ground hurriedly said: \"Don't let your bear come over, everything is negotiable...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson, who has just arrived, just needs to find someone to show his prestige, and this guy comes to his door by himself. Who is to blame?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic situation of the quartermaster was naturally deliberately arranged by Hudson. Otherwise, with Bear Stearns' style, a bear's paw will turn a person into a meat paste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now people are not reduced to a pulp, but their limbs are reduced to a pulp. With such an injury, even if he is rescued, his vitality will be exhausted, and he will survive for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent the quartermaster from dying early, Hudson deliberately cast magic to stop the bleeding for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Negative teaching materials, the living are often more educational than the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, if you are away from home, you have to give the host a face. Killing people directly, everyone will lose face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This disposition is just right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is passed on, it is the responsibility of the quartermaster himself. The military supplies are shoddy, and it is not too much to just be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the beating was a little bit \"billion\", it didn't hurt. It's normal for the Earth Bear to be unable to grasp the severity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can negotiate slowly, but it doesn't mean that monsters also need to negotiate. Dare to deduct the rations of Warcraft, this unknown quartermaster deserves to be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's embarrassing to think about it. I acted too fast just now, and forgot to ask the name of the unlucky guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson led the supplies and patted his **** away, but the bureaucrats in logistics exploded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't seen such arrogance in many years, and they simply don't take their logistics department seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't check, you don't know, and if you check, you will be dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guest Army\", they came here to help, and they are not bound by the military law of the Principality of Moxi at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a quartermaster being beaten up. Even if such a trivial matter was brought up to the top, there is a high probability that it would be turned into a small one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that they violated the taboo by distributing moldy grain as military rations, which could not be brought to the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a trouble, Hudson, who is a meritorious minister, will not be unlucky. Anyway, a large group of people in the logistics department will be unlucky first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Sanford, who is in charge of front-line logistics, now has a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to make trouble like this, it is clear that you are not someone to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is not a question of whether their logistics department will find trouble with others, but whether Hudson will continue to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Distributing moldy food to the guest army as military supplies, if this kind of thing goes up, it is a proper diplomatic event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Falling into the eyes of the Alpha Kingdom, this is not paying attention to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Principality of Moxi is counting on reinforcements from various countries to save its life. If something like this happened, there must be an explanation!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although many dignitaries in the principality have a share in the benefits of military supplies, he, the person in charge, is responsible for the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Gio, is that idiot dead?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Sanford asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had greeted the bastard's family countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine to take advantage of it in normal times, but you have to keep your eyes open!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others may be concerned about the network of contacts involved in the logistics department, worrying about offending someone they shouldn't provoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to be afraid of the guest army from outside the country, and they are not in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to wear small shoes for others, it depends on whether they buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a hurry, they directly put down their picks on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Made a mess, and the Principality of Moxi had to take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the poor Viscount Gio has just been rescued and is in a very bad state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the pastor, it was because the bear hit too hard, hurting his vitality and consuming too much vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we can find a treasure to restore vitality, our Viscount Gio may not have a few years to live. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the chief guard said, Earl Sanford slammed the table and shouted coldly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is a disgrace to the nobles of the principality that this idiot is still alive after causing a catastrophic disaster at this juncture!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the truth, Sanford really wants this subordinate to die now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Viscount Gio died on the spot, the matter would be settled easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing a noble is also a big event. The two parties have a handle on each other, so they just cover up the matter and it's over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Viscount Gio survived, so everything will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beating up a corrupt nobleman is not a crime at all. If you want to get rid of the blame, the Alpha Kingdom must be willing to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the two countries need each other now, the Alpha Kingdom is obviously on the stronger side and has a greater right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Earl Sanford didn't think about murdering and silence, but he just didn't dare to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassination of nobles is a very taboo thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there are too many people living in Viscount Gio, and all of them were silenced, the impact is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the news leaked out, he would be finished with it, no amount of backstage could cover it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the chief guard at the side immediately realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when the officials of the logistics department clashed with the front-line officers because of the distribution of military supplies, Earl Sanford always supported his own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had never been so panicked in the face of a front-line officer, no matter how old he was. Only this time, when he lost his temper, it was obvious that something serious happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, the chief guard directly mourned for Viscount Gio.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when I was about to make a big fortune, I bumped into the hardest iron plate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is there no hope for revenge, but even whether he can spend the rest of his life safely has become an unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, he made a decision to cut off the Viscount Gio who was about to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a pity that the generous gift I received just now, I haven't had time to open it to see what it is, and now I have to return it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, now that something has happened, it will not help to pursue responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crux of the problem lies in Earl Hudson. If he can be made to keep his mouth shut, this incident can be regarded as nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disaster was caused by Viscount Gio, so naturally he should be responsible for the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can't handle this matter, we will spend more favors and ask Viscount Raquel to come forward to make peace. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a discovery of conscience, it's mainly because you have to do things after receiving the gift. This is a matter of principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it can't be done and the gift is returned in the end, you have to try it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Gio can buy him as the head of the guard, and he can also buy other people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has never been a secret in the logistics department. If Viscount Gio knows that he has nothing to do, and he is bitten out by breaking the jar, it will be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he has given his idea now. As for whether Viscount Gio can seize the opportunity, it has nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp, Marshal Hodge is fighting at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the front line, there are endless affairs to be dealt with every day, which is commonplace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After approving the last official document, Marshal Hodge slowly raised his head and asked the adjutant beside him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I heard that the famous Earl of Hudson had a conflict with the logistics department. Where is the progress now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the speed of news transmission in the military camp is fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The day was not over yet, not only the officials of the logistics department received the news, but even the frontline commander also knew.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the questioning of Marshal Hodge, it can be seen that he hopes to make a big news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of logistical corruption in the Principality of Moxi has plagued the military for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the interests involved in it are too complicated. Even if he is now the commander in chief of the front line, Hodge has no confidence to get rid of this cancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't dare to move yourself, it doesn't mean you don't want others to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a guest army, the Wright County Legion has nothing to do with these interest groups, so it is undoubtedly a good pawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the logistics of reinforcements. Once things get serious, the Alpha Kingdom will definitely get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, it will become a matter between two countries, and it will even attract more countries' attention. If you want to cover it up, you won't be able to cover it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of the general trend, not an interest group can handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pulling out this cancer is definitely a great thing for the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, Earl Hudson has returned to the barracks since the daytime quarrel, as if he didn't take it seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The injured Viscount Gio was rescued by a priest. It's just that the state is a bit bad, and I'm afraid I can only retire early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics department was a bit complicated. Some officials clamored for revenge, but they were scolded **** by Earl Sanford.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that he wants to deal with it coldly, and retaliate after the storm passes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the adjutant said, Marshal Hodge laughed, then shook his head and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Harley, you guessed wrong this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The handle fell into someone else's hands, and that old fox Sanford didn't have the guts to retaliate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, even if he wants revenge, what can he do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it possible that you dare not send supplies to the Wright County Legion?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that the materials are not distributed, even if the materials are only a few days late, the Alpha Kingdom will protest to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the life and death of the kingdom, and the king pursues it, but the board will be hit on himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I guessed correctly, he should be busy trying to figure out a way to make big things smaller and small things smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, losing face is better than losing life. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interest groups involved in the logistics are indeed large, but these vested interests only want to reap the benefits, but are not prepared to drag the Principality of Moxi to hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in ordinary times, the benefits are mostly shoddy, and no one is foolish enough to take all of them and make the frontline officers and soldiers hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not pushing people to a dead end, that's why they've been able to make a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, watching people order food is also a compulsory course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, 80 to 90% of the logistics supplies of the main force of the principality can be received, and it is not surprising to meet some powerful generals to get all the shares.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real unlucky thing is the large number of cannon fodder corps, their own strength is poor, the right to speak in the army is not high, and there is no capital to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Detaining the supplies of one's own people, that's all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County Legion, which is not easy to mess with at first glance, is obviously not in the category of materials that can be embezzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the situation along the way, we can see that no one of the officials who are responsible for providing supplies along the way dares to cheat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to do this is obviously because the interest groups behind have no idea about this part of the material. When this kind of problem occurs on the front line, it is obvious that some people have made their own claims.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interest groups behind it didn't benefit from it, so naturally they wouldn't stand up for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Something happened, and all the bureaucrats in the logistics department, including Earl Sanford, had to bear the consequences themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing all this, Marshal Hodge quickly became worried again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wrightshire Regiment is a good knife, but he is not a knife holder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to make Hudson make trouble, he still lacks enough chips in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the name of the front-line commander is resounding, under the heavy checks and balances, his actual power has not reached the point where he promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp, Hudson, who was eating a big meal, had no idea that he had inadvertently fallen into the vortex of power struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happens during the day is just a small episode in life. If he didn't want to stand up, he could have solved the problem in a more civilized way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: on the grounds of distributing moldy food from the Quartermaster Office, it was announced that the Wrightshire Army had been neglected on the front line, and they left directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcing reinforcements from the front line, this kind of political event cannot be undertaken by the bureaucrats of the logistics department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just take a stand and keep those greedy bureaucrats scared to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: using the diplomatic language agreed by the two countries to talk about the matter, and labeling it a big label of tearing up the covenant, can also make the quartermaster obediently obey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many civilized methods were not used, but the most violent method was adopted to solve the problem, which was also unlucky for the quartermaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Chief of the Legion, Viscount Gio is visiting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the chief guard's words, Hudson kept recalling in his mind, but he still couldn't find the memory of Viscount Gio.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No impression, that means not friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a stranger came to visit, he didn't have the time to receive him, so he waved his hand and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell Viscount Gio that I'm not free right now, and I'll tell you directly if I have something to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, when encountering such strange visitors, they will always deal with them in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are exceptions for some well-known figures, or nobles who are earls and above. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were in the Alpha Kingdom, Hudson would definitely not be so snobbish, but this is the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being friends with a group of small and medium-sized nobles is purely meaningless social interaction and has no effect on future development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite for being a corporal of courtesy and virtue still comes from value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With that free time, Hudson would rather catch up with the knights under his command than make friends with a strange viscount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, the Viscount Gio outside is the quartermaster during the day. Looking at the large pile of gifts he is carrying, it seems that he is here to make amends.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this unexpected answer, Hudson was a little confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling Viscount Gio's tough look during the day, he thought it had something to do with it. How could he soften so quickly after being beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, those who can act as quartermasters are all related households.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there is a conflict, it usually hits the younger ones and provokes the older ones, and then gains experience along the way to gain power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson prepared a way to deal with the difficulties and conflicts that would occur later, but it turned out to be such a play of apologizing, which was really unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring him in!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

A corrupt bureaucrat who drinks the blood of soldiers is not worthy of sympathy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The race war is so cruel, and it can be hindered at such a juncture, no matter how you deal with it, it can't be too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no extra sympathy for scum and scum. Even if Viscount Gio's current appearance is very miserable, it is his own fault, and he can't blame others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I know I regret it, why did I go earlier?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these bureaucrats holding back, I dare not say that the situation on the battlefield can be reversed. At least the soldiers on the front line of the Principality of Moxi will be in a much better mental state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Gio, what are you doing in my camp if you don't sleep this late at night?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that you feel that you have suffered during the day and want to get it back now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Still think I'm a bully and can tolerate your presumptuous visits? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To maintain the dignity of the nobles, it also depends on the person. A scum like Viscount Gio doesn't deserve his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Viscount Gio's face became even more ugly. He would have liked to tear Hudson to pieces if possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the strength and status gap between the two sides is too great. Even if all the connections are used, Hudson can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, those friends who called themselves brothers and sisters all avoided him after receiving the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Full of plans, no ability to execute them. The idea of ​​\"revenge\" can only be buried in the bottom of my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of his colleagues, Viscount Gio could only bite the bullet and come to the door, bowing his head and apologizing to his most hated enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, what happened during the day was purely a misunderstanding. The main reason is that we made a mistake in our work and didn't figure out your identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am very sorry for the trouble this has caused you. Now, on behalf of the logistics department, I assure you that similar things will never happen again in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a blank check. With the lessons learned from his unlucky guy, the bureaucrats in the logistics department have already opened their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ignorant behavior of extorting money without knowing the identity of the visitor, once happened is enough to alert everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Viscount Gio was also annoyed. If he had asked a few more questions that day and found out Hudson's identity, such an oolong incident would never have happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there is no medicine for regret in this world. After receiving a beating, half of his life was lost, and now whether he can retreat fully depends on whether Hudson is willing to let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the matter continues to escalate, it is uncertain how many people will be involved in the end. He, the person directly responsible, will definitely die in an ugly way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it will be labeled as \"human rape\" for colluding with orcs. Not only would his own life be at risk, but even his family would suffer as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"hehe!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Viscount Gio came here just to say these things, then you can leave now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My Wrightshire Legion represents the Alpha Kingdom, and I have come all the way to reinforce your country. There is hard work without credit!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I arrived at the front line, I actually enjoyed such unfair treatment. Even if I can forgive, the dignity of the kingdom cannot be violated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency the Viscount, do you think the dignity of my Alpha Kingdom is so cheap, can it be resolved with just an apology?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, I am already preparing to write a paper on the capital, and propose to the great Caesar III to withdraw the kingdom and enter the reinforcements of the Principality of Moxi. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is on the line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to be ripped off are not so easy to come across. Anyway, Viscount Gio had no ability to verify this with Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the Alpha Kingdom will withdraw its troops because of this, they can't afford to bet. As long as the window paper is pierced, the Principality of Moxi must give an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this matter is absolutely unacceptable. The frontline battle is urgent now. If there is no reinforcements, there will be a big accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please, for the sake of the human race, give us another chance. If you have any requirements, just ask, as long as we can do it, we will do our best to meet it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Gio promised again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was really scared of this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the neighbors all around have promised to send reinforcements, the core of the leader is the Alpha Kingdom. If this leading brother \"withdraws reinforcements\", the reinforcements promised by various countries will come to naught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the help of reinforcements, the Principality of Moxi might be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Provoking such a big incident, not only the people of the kingdom can't spare him, even the vested interest groups behind the logistics department can't help but destroy him all over the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Viscount Gio's promise, Hudson smiled slightly and said casually: \"What is it, what do I ask for?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this kind of thing, shouldn't you take the initiative to make compensation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I won't talk nonsense, what do you think the dignity of the Alpha Kingdom is worth, then give it to you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I guess you can't be the master, so you should go back as soon as possible and discuss with those who can be the master, and see what kind of sincerity they can show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the dignity of the kingdom cannot be desecrated. Any country or individual organization that dares to challenge the dignity of the kingdom will be punished most severely! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what you want, the key is what this group of people can provide. It is obviously unrealistic to expect them to cut their own flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, the price they paid will most likely be paid by the Principality of Moxi. This means that the compensation is very limited, and most of them will be what they have on hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Viscount Gio understood Hudson's true purpose. It's a pity that he really can't decide this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it, he felt aggrieved, obviously he had suffered a loss, and now he put down his dignity and came over to apologize, not to mention it, but also to run for his enemy and help the other party achieve their goals as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured that our sincerity will definitely not let you down.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Gio bit the bullet and promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the final result, he must first stabilize Hudson. Otherwise, if things get to the top, the lid won't be able to cover it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this, Hudson did not continue to be aggressive. It's easy to make things big, but it won't do him any good except to offend others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cleaning up moths for the Principality of Moxi is purely thankless. Any country that has lasted for hundreds of years will inevitably breed carrion inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elimination of rotten flesh can certainly gain new life; but in the process of elimination, it is also possible to die directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this is the sequelae of high class solidification. It is not personal strength that can be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially during wartime, large-scale internal changes are even more dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the camp of the expeditionary army, after the second and third legions joined forces, Crown Prince Caesar launched a vigorous military training operation on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Principality of Moxi repeatedly asked them to go to the front line to support them, he made excuses to fool them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were more than 30,000 people in the two legions, all of whom were practicing under their own command, and Crown Prince Caesar's spirit gradually improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the strength in his hands, which obviously doesn't match the plan in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the nobles below are willing to accept the personal training of his crown prince, it can't change the fact that the quality of soldiers varies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite among them can be compared with the main army. But more are still at the cannon fodder level, at most they have some military foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing and tossing for a few days, seeing little effect, the patience of Crown Prince Caesar has gradually worn down a lot, and he couldn't help asking:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Jose, they are all county soldiers. Why is there such a big gap between the Second Army and the Third Army and the First Army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the question, Count Jose secretly rolled his eyes. Even if you want to say this kind of thing, you should avoid it a little bit, and say it in front of the commanders of the second and third armies, isn't it a slap in the face?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wanted to return to his thoughts, but he couldn't remind them in front of everyone. As the crown prince, the young Caesar may not care about the world, but he, a court nobleman, cannot be so straightforward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, there are actually special reasons why the First Legion can have such a strong combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of composition, the First Legion is mainly composed of three parts, namely: the private army of the Koslow family, the private army of the children of the northern nobles, and the private army of the local nobles in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private army of the Koslow family was carefully built by the Earl of Hudson, and it can be said that they are all first-class elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large part of the private army of the sons of the northern nobles came from the northern border battlefield, and the proportion of veterans is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last group of private troops of local nobles in the southeastern province also had combat experience. Most of the noble officers participated in the suppression of the Skull and Bones rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few years, there has been constant friction between the native nobles of Wright County and the nobles of the North. The special environment also forced both sides to increase their military investment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This chaos continued until after the war broke out. In the end, Earl Hudson came forward to mediate the conflict between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers and soldiers of the First Legion themselves have rich combat experience, and after the war broke out, Earl Hudson trained them intensively for a period of time, and only then did they have their current combat effectiveness. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the person in charge of the conscription work, an elite army suddenly appeared under his command. How can we do it without in-depth research?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This research has clarified the ins and outs of the Wright County Legion. Although the story is somewhat legendary, this is indeed the most reasonable explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I deliberately introduced the First Legion in such detail, emphasizing the \"specialty\" of the First Legion many times, mainly to help the two embarrassing legion leaders next to me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Earl Jose's opinion, the performance of the Second and Third Legion is not bad. At the very least, it can be called excellent compared to the last legion behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combat strength is not as good as that of the First Legion, that's what it should be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the county soldiers had reached the level of an elite division, it would not be the orcs invading the Alpha Kingdom, but the army of the Alpha Kingdom galloping the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar was obviously dissatisfied with this explanation. \"Special\" means that it is difficult to copy, and it also means that his idea of ​​building all the next few legions into elites went bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is just an idea, and it was not raised in front of everyone. Otherwise, there must be a big joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can train your soldiers to be elite, who would want to bring a group of cannon fodder to the battlefield?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that this not only requires a lot of financial investment, but also requires the commander to have sufficient military literacy, and it also takes a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without systematic military learning, without experience in actually commanding an army in combat, and only relying on the inheritance of experience recorded by the elders of the family, there are very few who can become generals by self-study.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to betting on this probability, everyone prefers to cultivate an army of practitioners. As long as the individual combat power is strong enough, it is an elite team that can be taken out to fight a few battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the news from the front line, the orcs have added troops to the front line of the Principality of Moxi. The reinforcements this time are not cannon fodder, but the elite of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi kept urging us to go to the front line, but they were actually frightened by the behavior of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A preliminary estimate is that among the orc army outside Terence's line of defense, there are at least two Beamon legions, three Silver Moon wolf cavalry legions, four bear legions, three lion legions, and two eagle legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total force should be between 150,000 and 200,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these elite troops, there are more than 500,000 vassal race miscellaneous soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the defense of the city, with the strength of the Principality of Moxi, it would not be an opponent of the orc army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many troops gathered, it is estimated that the general attack of the orcs is about to begin. The time left for us to prepare is very limited, everyone must hurry up and train the troops! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words of Crown Prince Caesar fell, everyone's expressions became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs gathered on the front line of the Principality of Moxi is definitely not a good thing for the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Terence's line of defense collapses, the next third line of defense may be difficult to stop the front of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a reinforcement, everyone will inevitably go to the battlefield to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the six legions that came to reinforce them are all elite, then there is nothing to be afraid of. Even if you encounter the main force of the orcs, you can still bite off a piece of meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the orcs have concentrated so many elite troops, and our strength alone may not help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people should not pin their hopes on us, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Andres asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't know the strength of his allies, but he didn't have any confidence in the Second Corps of the Expeditionary Army he led.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to bully orcs and small soldiers, but if you encounter elite orcs, it's like giving away your head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on past experience, only the elite troops can fight against the elite orcs. Ordinary legions and elite orcs meet in the wild, and they can easily be pierced by the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the Moxi people are not that stupid. As the first principality of the human race, they still have some strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the power of the whole country, at least hundreds of thousands of elites can be gathered. Although the quality is not as good as that of the elite orcs, as a defensive side, they can still make up for it with city defense fortifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to our human race, the fighting power of the five royal families of the orcs is indeed strong, but their number is still too small after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for them to pay hundreds of thousands of elite losses in order to destroy the Principality of Moxi. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Marshal Hodge has issued two calls for help, and many fortresses on the front line have been captured by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the core pass is still in our hands, if the current situation continues, the defenders on the front line may not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the battle damage reported by the front line, in the last half month alone, our troop loss has exceeded 20,000. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins said with a bitter face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others may contain moisture, but it is absolutely impossible to overreport the battle damage. If there is one less soldier, one less supply will be distributed. No one dares to make fun of the soldier's belly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of 20,000 people in half a month does not seem to be much. But the problem is that the Principality of Moxi is the side defending the city. From the outbreak of the war to the present, they have successively lost 200,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of them were caused by the fall of the Augustsburg defense line, and the rest were accumulated in successive battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a country with a population of just over 8 million, this is already one-fortieth of the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy is not a vicious orc, I am afraid that different voices have emerged in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where are our allies?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can do anything about the battle damage on the front line. The domestic war potential has almost been tapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are still young adults available, training still takes time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From serf to soldier, such a career span, there is no one year or a half that I can't adapt to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this kind of transformation will only take longer. Who made the Principality of Moxi lack enough qualified grassroots officers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the fall of the Fort August defense line, the Principality of Moxi lost not only the army, but also a large number of officers with rich combat experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most elite legions of the principality suffered heavy losses on the front line, and have not been able to recover their strength so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Alpha Kingdom's follow-up reinforcements are less than a hundred miles away from Da Pest, and they are currently undergoing rest and training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar promised that as long as the remaining five legions of the expeditionary force were assembled, they would go to the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements of the Principality of Orton are still 120 miles away from Da Pest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already done a good job in communication, and it is estimated that they will be able to go to the front line in ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the Principality of Fick and Earl of Ruilin entered our country five days ago, and they are expected to go to the front line at the end of the month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining countries have also completed military recruitment training one after another. It is expected that next month, he will be able to go to the front line to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is that something went wrong on the Warhammer Kingdom. They used the excuse of restraining the orc army to stop all the promised reinforcements in the border area. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The answer sheet handed over by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot be said to be perfect, but it can be regarded as quite satisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ally, this thing. It would be nice to be able to come over to help, but if you want someone to be the main force, it would be a bit embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if reinforcements are sent, the proportion of the standing army is very low. In the current situation, there are not many people who are optimistic about the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countries dispatched troops to reinforce, in addition to fulfilling the obligations of allies, they are still buying time for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of small countries, they also hope that the Principality of Moxi can delay until the Terran Alliance joins the war, so as to avoid burning the war to their own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reaction of the Warhammer Kingdom, it seems that they have done a great thing in the name of containing the orc army, but in fact they are strengthening the defense of their own border areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to blame, it is human nature to tend to the pros and cons. The premise of helping your allies is to protect yourself first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Deploy three new legions in training to reinforce the front line, recruit all advanced mages from the Magic Academy, and recruit domestic mercenary organizations, chambers of commerce... and other civilian forces to join the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell Marshal Hodge: Follow-up reinforcements will arrive soon. The Principality has no way out, and Terrence's line of defense must not be lost no matter what.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs directly raised the mercenary mission issued in the country of mercenaries to the highest level, and invited all mercenary groups on the mainland to participate in the battle against the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is based on the number of five royal orcs killed, and there is no upper limit on the bounty. We can give gold, silver and jewelry, titles of beauties, cultivation resources, and even fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specific standards, you discuss and formulate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those assassin organizations hidden in the dark cannot be ignored. Hang all the big orcs on me, and if you can kill one, it counts as one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the Principality of Moxi has reached the moment of life and death. From now on, we must make up our minds and use all our strength to deal with the orcs! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Chris IX sighed deeply. He has done all the work that can be done, and the rest can only be left to fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If increasing the intensity of mobilization and recruiting mercenaries to fight are normal operations, then running to the Assassin Organization to take up missions is a sign of moral integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was not at the end of the mountain, Chris IX would not use this infamous method to ruin his reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On July 17, 99988 in the sacred calendar, the 17th Terran Alliance Conference kicked off in Lutetia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no flowers, no applause, only the dignified faces of the representatives present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turbulent situation in the mainland has become more and more serious, and has had a serious impact on the dominance of the human race in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of alien races who are about to move, seem to be getting better. These days, they have been stretching out their tentacles to test, as if it is the prelude to the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the initiator and host of this alliance meeting, Charles III naturally became the host of this round of meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome everyone to Lutetia to participate in the 17th Alliance Expansion Meeting of the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Same as previous meetings, the topic we are discussing now is how to maintain the position of our human race on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mainland has been at peace for decades, and now it has come to an era of turbulence. I think everyone has felt it. In the past few years, the friction between us and various ethnic groups has suddenly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relevant information was handed over to you two days ago, and everyone must have read it by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, every hundred years, thousands of years, and ten thousand years in the sacred calendar, the Aslant Continent will be full of flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And these catastrophes are constantly being replaced. From the Titans and dragons in ancient times to the elves in the middle ages, almost every change of the continent's overlord is related to the ten thousand year node.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they didn't fall immediately, they all made mistakes at such critical points, which hurt their own vitality, and then slowly declined and were replaced by latecomers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the major events that happened every ten thousand years in history, the current invasion of northern orcs and the frequent disturbances of alien races in various places can only be regarded as the prelude to the coming of the great era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now that we have caught up with the first 100,000 years, the foreign races have invaded in an all-round way, the sea clan has made a comeback, or maybe it is the invasion of demons. No one knows what weird disasters will happen this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deal with the complex situation that may occur next, today's meeting was held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of a responsible attitude towards the human race, I hope that representatives of the congressmen can abandon the past disputes and make fair and objective decisions in the next meeting!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III's speech made the already dignified atmosphere in the hall even more depressing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fate of the race, this topic is too heavy. Even some representatives who were at odds with the Frankish Kingdom did not dare to mess around with this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be a coincidence that history happens once, but it must not be a coincidence if it repeats itself every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any carelessness may lead to unpredictable consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In ancient times, the human race was just one of many small races. It is precisely because of the replacement of the overlord of the mainland and the reshuffle of forces time and time again that he slowly accumulated his family fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took only a few hundred years for the human race to truly seize the hegemony of the mainland. Compared with the ancient races that have ruled the mainland for many years, they do not have any advantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the human race is divided, facing internal and external competition, which has never stopped, and everyone has a stronger sense of urgency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some countries are corrupt and degenerate, most of the human race countries are still operating normally and have not entered a period of decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike the overlords in the ancient times, there is only one unified regime. Once the interior begins to degenerate, it will embark on a road of no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty Charlie is right. At the juncture of the 100,000 years of the sacred calendar, we must unite to face the challenges we may encounter next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suggest that everyone join hands to clean up the hidden dangers that may threaten us first, for example: the orc empire that invaded the northern border of our human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representative of Alpha Kingdom was the first to respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scripts are all well-arranged, and now they are only performed according to the prior agreement. Anyway, all the facts are stated, and the orcs are indeed the biggest unstable factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, they have launched dozens of wars in an attempt to regain their lost supremacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really decided to clear the field in advance, the Orc Empire will be the first nail to be pulled out. Even if they couldn't be uprooted, the orcs had to be maimed first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This proposal, which is in line with the interests of the northern countries, immediately won the support of the representatives of the northern countries. Coupled with the strong support of the Frankish Kingdom, it immediately entered the voting stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprises, the proposal was passed by a high number of votes. It's just that when it comes to the specific dispatch of troops, it's a different scene in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supporting the proposal is for the sake of the overall situation. In the past years, beating orcs was also a routine activity of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost every few decades, the two sides will fight once. One after another toss, all countries have long hated orcs to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was time to contribute, everyone's vital interests were involved, and the representatives returned from enthusiasm to rationality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terence defense line, staying in Hudson in the barracks, finally ushered in a heavyweight visitor, Earl Sanford, the front-line quartermaster of the Principality of Mosi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from his indifferent attitude towards the hapless Viscount Gio, Hudson still gave enough face to a powerful bureaucrat like Earl Sanford.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to noble etiquette, the reception was conducted in a satisfactory manner. While flattering each other, the two chatted happily, as if they were old friends meeting each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, we are deeply sorry for the misunderstanding that occurred in front of the logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I came here this time to apologize to you on behalf of the ignorant guys in the logistics department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show sincerity, I also brought the magic crossbow assigned to your army by the capital in advance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Sanford's words, Hudson knew that today's topic had begun. When it comes to interest disputes, it cannot be resolved with a few polite words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obtaining the magic crossbow in advance can only be regarded as a favor at best, and it is still far from enough to satisfy Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Sanford is polite, if it's just a matter of my personal face, this is indeed a trivial matter, as long as the misunderstanding is cleared up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that this matter involves the dignity of our Alpha Kingdom, so your country must show a gesture to prove the importance it attaches to us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he hated going online the most, but when it was his turn, he suddenly discovered that this thing is really easy to use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the dignity of a country is involved, it cannot be solved by friendship. No matter who you choose as a lobbyist, you must be cautious on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson can rest assured, I came here with the most sincere sincerity. What do you think we can do to make up for our previous mistakes, even if we say it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Sanford's heart was bleeding. This is the first time since he served as a quartermaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, no matter which general met him, he had to be polite. Every now and then, I have to offer a generous gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Marshal Hodge, the commander-in-chief of the front line, had to sell some face when he saw him. Never had such humiliation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have already felt Earl Sanford's sincerity. Since your country is so sincere, then I won't hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the friendship between the two countries, I will not mention the excessive demands. Now there are only a few symbolic small requests, all of which are within the scope of your authority. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson handed over a prepared parchment, and Earl Sanford was instantly dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that he would be able to take things lightly after working so hard to build a friendship for so long, but I didn't expect the turning point to come so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the supplies on the list, Earl Sanford's face turned green. Ordinary meat and arrows are fine, it is not a big problem to distribute more to the guest army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is all kinds of magic equipment, such as: magic crystal cannon, magic bed crossbow, magic catapult...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is owned by the Principality of Moxi, it will appear on the list. The weapons and equipment are all gone, and ammunition supplies are naturally indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the number of magic cores and magic spar required above, Earl Sanford was very suspicious of wanting to evacuate his logistics department.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, there are too many of these things. To tell you the truth, I have opened up all the inventory on the front line, and I can't make it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, many of the equipment on it are heavy weapons. Although the power is very good, it is very inconvenient to carry in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there are craftsmen, peasants, and livestock, which you don't need at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Sanford cried helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a quartermaster for so many years, he felt like a poor ghost for the first time. Looking at this list, it's like you haven't seen the market before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Sanford, you are too petty. There is no front line, but it does not mean that there is no principality. As long as you are willing to find a way, you will definitely be able to get it together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is nothing more than reporting more battle damage. The battle on the front line is so fierce, and the loss of magic equipment is also reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the peasants, artisans, and animals, when these things are all in place, won't they be needed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are all for dealing with orcs, no matter which legion they are equipped with, it is not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are worried about trouble, we can publicize that this kind of weapons and equipment are all brought from the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone has any objections, let them go to the Alpha Kingdom to investigate. If the evidence can be found, all the responsibility is mine! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be seen that the current armaments of the Principality of Moxi are not rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, how much can Hudson take away even if Hudson has a big appetite?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all the ordnance was in place, but the artisans and civilian husbands all sent it over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that in the eyes of big shots, labor is really worthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After counting the supplies, before he had time to be happy, Hudson received an invitation from Marshal Hodge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The transaction was exposed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the idea was born, it was cut off by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this kind of thing is really exposed, the bureaucrats in the logistics will have a way to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a guest army, even if the Principality of Moxi wants to hold him accountable, it is impossible to hit him with the board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the commander-in-chief on the front line, the smartest way to discover this kind of thing is to pretend not to know anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter whose hands the ordnance fell into, it was meant to be used to fight the orcs. As long as it is not smuggled out of customs, it means that the meat has rotted in the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wanted to lift the cover and make matters worse, he, the frontline commander, could not do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, everyone will be offended, and how will everyone cooperate in the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with trading, so it can only be a military mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, Hudson can see how much pressure is on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terence City is a good pass fortress. Some fortresses hanging outside were directly besieged by the orc army and almost lost contact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcements are non-existent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dared to take the risk of being besieged by the orcs to send reinforcements to these besieged fortresses. The defenders inside could only count on themselves now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, in these military fortresses, there is a habit of hoarding food and water sources. As long as the defenders can block the enemy's attack, it will be fine for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the minds of some people, using the defenders in the fortress to attract orcs to attack and consume the enemy's troops is also a very cost-effective deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, at this time, the defenders can't run away. He didn't want to be sent to the grill, so he had to fight the orcs to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of desperation, the potential of people can be most stimulated. It is not impossible for the cannon fodder troops to play a combat power close to the main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the first game of this game is Alpha Kingdom. It's just that the Principality of Moxi has only learned half of it so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats of the Alpha Kingdom did this at first, mainly because of the responsibility of guarding the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have a duty, I can't leave the territory and run away, and I don't want to be the soul of the orc.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The castle is simply built tall and thick, and the inner city defenses are layered one after another. The whole castle is a war machine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the attack of the orc army, everyone just played the game of fortifying the wall and clearing the field, leading the people to hide in the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary fortress castle is not worth smashing by the orc army. Usually after a tentative attack, you will give up after finding out that it is a hard bone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a successful example, more people will soon follow suit. So much so that it has developed to the present, the northern provinces of the Alpha Kingdom are full of various fortresses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there are too many fortresses, you only need to add a city wall in the middle to become a new line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the army of orcs, the defenders in these fortresses are all good boys; as soon as the main army of orcs leaves, they immediately come out to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the orcs didn't think about pulling out these nails blocking the road. Unfortunately, after many attempts, I found that this is completely worth the candle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many cannon fodder races in the Orc Empire, they cannot hold back the castles and fortresses along the way that are easy to defend and difficult to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To capture a castle, not only need to pay a lot of casualties, but also need to consume a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Push down one fort after another, and the time has passed before the battle line has advanced much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, no matter how much cannon fodder there is, it is limited after all, and will eventually be used up one day. At that time, you can't use the main force to smash the city wall, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps drawing on the successful experience of the Alpha Kingdom, the Principality of Moxi also built its own strategic defense line in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the operating modes of the two parties are similar, but the difference is actually very big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being passively bordered by the orcs, the insecure Moxi Principality, in order to quickly build a strategic defense line of its own, directly led the central government to organize the construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side is a fortress built to save his own life, and the other side is a fortress built under the leadership of bureaucrats. Anyway, Hudson does not believe that the quality of the two sides can be the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fallen Augustsburg Line is an example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being caught off guard by the enemy is only one aspect, and there are loopholes in the city defense construction, which is also one of the core reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if the city defense map is exposed, it will not be attacked by the enemy and destroy all the anti-aircraft firepower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the reaction is a step slower and the outer city is lost, the inner city can still be defended. There is no guarantee that you will hold on, at least you can hold on for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, time is life. Even if it is just one more day, it may change the situation of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi was able to withstand the worst wave of beatings, perhaps the one being beaten now would become the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking on the street where only sergeants shuttled, the strong smell of gunpowder blows to the face, which is so depressing that it can be suffocating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stepping into the Marshal's mansion, there are already many officers gathered inside, Hudson is considered to be late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the guidance of the guards, he sat down in a front seat and immediately attracted everyone's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is acquaintances, only Hudson is a strange visitor, the position is still very front, the identity is ready to be revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one came forward to strike up a conversation, let alone provoke him. From the envious and jealous eyes of everyone, it can be seen that the news about him making a big fuss about the Military Supply Department must have spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of thing can't be imitated by everyone. As a guest army, after fighting the battle, you can pat your **** and leave, and it doesn't matter if you offend someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the military officers present need to consider their own family interests, and they may even be beneficiaries in the chain of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interests are involved, so naturally you can't act according to your temper. Even if you feel a little wronged, you can only bear it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has long been used to all this. In order to reduce the pain of parting, he has never been interested in making friends with the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the dozens of officers present, half of them survived after the battle, and that was the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi unfortunately collapses in the war, it might be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not interested in betting on the odds, so he simply ignored everyone and closed his eyes to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone who can come here has arrived, so now the meeting begins. I guess you have guessed it, the main reason for calling you here this time is to deal with the increase of orc troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not as exaggerated as the rumors say, the Alpha Kingdom still holds back most of the orcs' strength, and the number of enemies we have increased is only tens of thousands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone is united and keeps the enemy out of the line of defense, there is still hope for completion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge's words pulled Hudson out of his meditation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the orcs has only increased by \"tens of thousands\", but the threat of these tens of thousands is more than the hundreds of thousands of cannon fodder outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of these guys completely brought down the already tilted victory balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even defending the city is not easy. Among the five royal families of the orcs, except the Yingren family, which are all airmen, and the Beamon family, which are all cavalry, the other three have infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Randomly pull out a team and put it among the human race. They are all first-class and elite, and they belong to the existence on the ceiling of combat power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs make up their minds, no one knows whether Terence's line of defense can be held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the elite infantry regiment of the orcs has also come, I am afraid this time they are determined to break through our defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe we can still defend Terence City now, but the front that stretches for hundreds of miles is full of loopholes. It is too easy for the orcs to break through and enter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army got in the way last time, and now it is even more difficult to guard against. The enemy only needs to capture a few fortresses to open a safe passage more than ten miles wide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy has so many elites, leaving just a few cavalry regiments to guard them, it will be difficult for our defenders to destroy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs divide their troops to contain us, and the army goes south to take the king's capital Dapace, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the words came to his lips, the middle-aged officer swallowed them back. This kind of unpleasant speculation has always been \"can only be understood, not expressed in words\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the middle-aged man's analysis, Hudson couldn't help but take a second look. Being able to analyze the problem so thoroughly is obviously not for the idle generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now these problems happen to be what the Terence defense line defenders need to worry about the most, even more important than the enemy launching a full-scale attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political factors aside, once the orcs divide and advance, the army's logistics will be cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the Principality of Moxi is empty, it is obviously impossible to stop the advance of the orc army. The destruction of the country and the family may happen at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wagner, the situation you analyzed may indeed become a reality, and even the orcs have already begun planning and implementing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like they haven't done similar operations. How could the principality be completely defenseless?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inconvenient to disclose the specific plan. Our current task is to defend the Terence line, and the rest of the matter will be considered by the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure nothing goes wrong, I plan to increase troops to some fortresses with high strategic value and implement key regional protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling you over for a meeting today is to prepare to readjust the previous combat missions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson, the situation is tense now, and the frontline troops are tight, so you have also been arranged for combat deployment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the situation is calm, but in fact Marshal Hodge's heart is also in turmoil, and he has no confidence at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things cannot be done by preparation alone. Even though the orc's combat intentions are now felt, the Principality of Moxi does not have enough strength to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, reinforcements from various countries have arrived one after another, otherwise Hodge really doesn't know how the Principality can deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the voice fell to the ground, everyone's eyes were focused on Hudson, waiting for his answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, there is no problem in participating in the battle. Since we left our hometown, we have been prepared to fight the orcs to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that you are not familiar with the place, so you have to prepare for a few days to get used to it. Now that we are not familiar with the place, it is best not to make the station too complicated. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military service missions are definitely unavoidable. From the moment I arrived at the front line, many things became involuntary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is nothing more than that the task came too soon, and did not wait for the follow-up legions of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having not contacted for such a long time, Hudson suddenly felt that Crown Prince Caesar might be planning something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such untimely guesses, of course, cannot be told to outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not enough army in his hands to be brave, and with only one legion in his hand, Hudson dare not go out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Marshal Hodge suddenly laughed, and directly handed the garrison map to Hudson, pretending to be generous and saying:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, the Earl of Hudson can come for reinforcements from thousands of miles away, this small request is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Need to send additional troops to garrison places, all of which are marked here, you can choose by yourself! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to go to the front line, it doesn't matter where you are stationed. Whether it is safe or not is relative, the key is where the orcs will attack from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Marshal Hodge, no matter where the Wrightshire Army is stationed, it can save a lot of troops and then use them where they are most needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the information marked on the map, Hudson went blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an outsider, even if he has done some homework, he only knows one geographical location, and there is no time to understand the specific details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of everyone, you can't shrink back at this time. After a little hesitation, Hudson pointed at the map and said heartily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just choose this place. There is also a Flying Bear Castle in my hometown. It is fate to be able to meet it now.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's definitely fate, not him, Mr. Hudson, who is picky about fat and thin. As a nobleman who owns the Earth Bear, he has reason to have a good impression of the fortress with the bear in its name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the disappointed eyes of everyone, it can be roughly seen that the garrison position he chose should be pretty good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the crowd, Marshal Hodge said expressionlessly: \"Since Earl Hudson likes Flying Bear's Fort, you are responsible for leading troops to garrison here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the Wrightshire Army, the new Twenty-Third Army will also assist you in stationing here. For the specific military deployment, His Excellency the Earl can discuss with the commander of the Raquel Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the defense change is completed, the Sixth Army Corps and the newly formed Third Army Corps stationed here will first withdraw to rest and replenish their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of military orders were continuously issued from Marshal Hodge, and none of the officers present made a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson suddenly understood why the Mossi were able to stabilize the front line. The internal bureaucracy is rotten, but there are still a few Optimus Primes after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orders and prohibitions are the fundamental principles of an army. It is definitely not easy for the unknown Marshal Hodge to be able to manage an army composed of private troops of nobles in a submissive manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

For no other reason than antiquity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, what matches ancient is powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Erwin family, which was enshrined here, has been passed down for more than forty generations. In terms of strength, among the nobles of the Principality of Moxi, the ranking has always been very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lair carefully built by the veteran nobles, needless to say the defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the ancient nobles finally ran out of luck, Viscount John, the current patriarch of the Irwin family, was unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Fort Augustus fell, as one of the supporting teams, unfortunately, an encounter with the orcs occurred in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention his own death in battle, the family private army brought out was almost wiped out, and the Erwin family declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The senior officials of the Principality of Moxi gave up the rescue of Fort Augustus, which is also directly related to this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiefdom nobles have suffered heavy losses, and the line of defense still needs to be defended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The task of defending Flying Bear Castle naturally fell to the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Raquel, why do you look so ugly?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stationing in a heavily fortified area like Flying Bear's Fort is considered a good job no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't celebrate, there is no need to put on a dead face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps awakened by his words, Viscount Raquel hastily explained:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Earl Hudson, I lost my composure just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At today's meeting, I didn't see my brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a meeting, as the commander of the main army, he should not be absent. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People who should not be absent are absent, either because of delays or accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation on the front line, if there is no bad news, there is a high probability that they are besieged by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a second generation, Raquel is not really ignorant, and knows very well what this means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his elder brother had an accident, he became the heir to the title, but his elder brother also took away the most elite army of the family when he went out this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If an accident happens unfortunately, the power of the family is bound to be severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a big family, once the vitality is seriously injured, it is often the beginning of the turn from prosperity to decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Racker is self-aware and knows very well that the worst will happen, and he has no ability to turn the tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just a family. Looking at it further, the fate of the Principality of Moxi is also in the midst of wind and rain. A little carelessness is the fate of destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can only express sympathy for this change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught in the siege of the orc army, there is no better choice than to die to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get reinforcements, you can only get reinforcements if you delay the arrival of reinforcements from various countries in the middle and late stages of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, according to past experience, the risk of being besieged by the orc army is not too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is not a battleground like Fort Augustus, relying on a large military fortress to guard against death, the probability of being able to withstand the attack of the orc army is at least 60%. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, Hudson realized something was wrong. It seems that these comforting words had the opposite effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A probability of more than 60% means that the Alpha Kingdom has been besieged and experienced, which does not mean that the Principality of Moxi can also do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning of the war to the present, there is no fortress in the Principality of Moxi that can withstand the siege of the enemy for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city with the best performance only persisted for less than three months after being besieged by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also the reason why the war broke out not long ago. With the passage of time, someone is bound to stand out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, to survive under the siege of the orc army, in addition to one's own strength, more depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs make up their minds, there is no fortress that cannot be conquered. The difference is limited to the size of the casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who survived were all lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Raquel, luck is too illusory. Once the strength of the family suffers a serious blow, the good days of his second generation will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't say anything more. This kind of embarrassing thing happens every day on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old aristocrats are declining, and the emerging aristocrats are rising. In troubled times, anything is possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the autumn wind, the expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom, which was constantly experiencing ups and downs, finally joined forces in Dexarte.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the five legions gathered in his hands, Crown Prince Caesar had not had time to be happy for a long time before he encountered a new problem—there was not enough training ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Moxi people didn't cooperate, it's because there are too many expeditionary troops. There are more than 75,000 officers and soldiers in the five legions, and the training ground is not a star and a half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front two legions can also allow soldiers to take turns to rest and train. It is definitely not possible now. The five legions rotate together, which becomes a practice every five days, which does not have the meaning of pre-war assault training at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is the front line where there are many soldiers, who is full in the rear to support such a big training ground!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to occupy the wheat fields by force, and the local nobles are not soft persimmons, not to mention that the Crown Prince Caesar cannot bear the notoriety of bullying the weak just for a training ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coordination is non-existent. In order to urge the expeditionary force to go to the battlefield, the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi were going crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost every day, Crown Prince Caesar can receive letters urging for help. Even his baby princess complained to him more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the position is not strong enough, I am afraid that it has already fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the passage of time, the political pressure on Crown Prince Caesar is still increasing day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the good performance of the First Legion before, which helped the Expeditionary Force gain a lot of points, the criticism from the outside world would be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Moxi people are really useless. They have wasted such a fertile land. With a strong national strength, they can't stand it in such a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our First Legion is on the battlefield, and they are still urging every day, as if they can't survive without us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just followed up the troops, and now they can't take a few days of rest. Can't even win this little time? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Crown Prince Caesar tore up the parchment in his hand. An expression of impatience was written directly on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, I'm afraid the Moxi people will not be able to hold on any longer. The reinforcements from the Principality of Orton who just arrived have also been sent to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcements from various countries are speeding up, and official documents have also been sent from China, asking us to help the Moxi people survive this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is tense now, why don't we go to the front line to help first. Later, according to the development of the situation, the next step plan will be implemented. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the battlefield is changing every day. As the weak side, only by constantly adjusting the plan can we keep up with the development of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to use \"Dapest City\" as a bait to attract the orcs to go deep and implement the encirclement and annihilation plan, you must hold the line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the defense line of the Mosi people collapses, the orc army will drive straight in, instead of going deep alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Crown Prince Caesar also became entangled. Continuing to wait and see is indeed conducive to the implementation of the encirclement and annihilation plan, but that also requires the Moxi people to hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the defense line of the Moxi people collapses again, it will not be a little bit more difficult to organize the defense line later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it can be organized, someone must guard it. After defeating the elite of the army, the serf soldiers recruited temporarily cannot stop the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the domestic order, Caesar sighed helplessly. In the face of national interests, any plan is insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is not a desperate gambler. Dare to gamble on the fate of the Moxi people, it is because the Principality of Moxi does not belong to his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different when it comes to the Alpha Kingdom. This is his ancestral foundation, and Caesar is not crazy enough to put his own foundation on the line for a plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send the order down, the army will start tomorrow. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making this decision, Crown Prince Caesar relaxed a lot. The army has been stationed here without moving, and the pressure he has been under is not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how perfect the plan is, it is useless. The orc is unwilling to cooperate, and there is nothing he can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although deep down in his heart, he still believed that the orcs would send troops to attack the city of Dapace, but there was no way to predict this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the orcs on the front line are relatively stable, it is not impossible to push them all the way across.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the shouts of killing, a loud \"rumbling\" sound went straight into the sky. The city wall that originally blocked the orc army finally collapsed after countless times of destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the gap immediately attracted a frenzied influx of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defenders in the city rushed forward to intercept, the noble officers charged directly at the front line, and countless soldiers rushed forward to block the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapsed city wall became the focus of contention between the two sides. For a while, broken limbs and corpses flew all over the sky, and the ruins were stained red with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Clan heavy infantry attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the order of the orc commander, a group of soldiers in heavy armor appeared on the battlefield, and they joined the battle for the gap in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a group of hard-bodied enemies, the officers defending the city also dispatched elite heavy infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they are also heavy infantry. Human heavy infantry are not only weaker than bearmen in terms of physical strength and size.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It usually takes two to three human heavy infantry to fight against a bear heavy infantry. In this collision of steel, he was soon at a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of the Bearman heavy infantry, despite the heroic performance of the defenders, they were beaten back steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bowman, quickly use the magic crossbow to suppress the enemy's heavy infantry!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of life and death, cost is no longer considered. Ordinary bows and arrows have little effect on this group of iron bumps, only magic crossbows and magic crystal cannons have sufficient lethality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossbow arrows were fired one after another, and the charging Bearman heavy infantry quickly suffered casualties. It's a pity that compared with the charging orc army, the number of magic crossbows is too small after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the more lethal magic crystal cannon, it has long been lost in previous battles, and only the last one is still showing its residual heat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the orc centaur archers also appeared on the front line and launched a counterattack against the crossbowmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the magic crossbow has a longer range, and it doesn't need to consume too much physical strength to launch it. It should be advantageous in cross-firing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the magic crossbow is the same as the bow and arrow. It is people who determine the hit rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Widened the distance, and the hit rate was terribly low. As the distance got closer, his hit rate increased, and he also exposed himself within the range of the enemy's range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the orc army is also equipped with magic crossbows and magic crystal cannons, but the number is far smaller than that of the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, it will only be used at critical moments. Unlike the human race, almost every important military fortress will be equipped with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the number of such equipment is still pitiful. The entire Bethel Fortress is only equipped with six magic crystal cannons, and the combination of light and heavy magic crossbows is less than a hundred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rare quantity, coupled with the high price, made the defenders have to save a little. Under normal circumstances, you are reluctant to use it at all; once you use it, it means danger is coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the enemy keep rushing up the city wall, the original fortifications gradually lost their effect, Earl Langton, who realized that the situation was over, hurriedly ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Retreat to the inner city!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The retreat horn sounded, and the retreat of the defenders further aroused the madness of the orc army. Bloodthirsty orc soldiers poured into the city and started a massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the consequences of the poor quality of the soldiers were manifested. The planned orderly retreat did not happen, but a large-scale stampede occurred because of the rush to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone retreats in an orderly manner, and those who disturb the order will be killed. The supervisor team is responsible for supervision!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Langton's order was obviously too late. The moment the defenders fell into chaos, the orc army rushed forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle became more intense, and the original offensive and defensive battle in the outer city spread directly to the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid the chaos from impacting the defenders in the inner city, Earl Langton had no choice but to abandon his car to protect the commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Close the city gates and block all entrances and exits!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the order issued, countless defenders who had no time to evacuate remained in the outer city forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the sound of cursing resounded through the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of this could shake Earl Langton's determination. Seeing countless soldiers fall, even though his heart was bleeding, he still chose reason at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle is still going on. Accompanied by the fall of the outer city, there are also a bunch of nearby fortifications attached to the Bethel Fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sounds of killing and crying kept hitting Earl Langton's nerves. Looking at the falling family flag, he knew that the era belonging to the Leiboron family was about to come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was supposed to appease the morale of the army, but at this moment he lost interest. Like everyone else, thoughts of despair welled up in his mind, and he didn't think that an inner city could stop the orcs' soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Returning to the City Lord's Mansion, he took a longing look. Earl Langton told his eldest son, \"The city of Bethel can no longer be defended. After dark, you will take your younger brothers and sisters and leave through the secret passage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dark guards trained by the family were also brought along. How much heritage can be taken away counts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't go to Dapace, the family's century-old business has fallen so quickly, and the Principality of Moxi may not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troubled times are coming, and now is just the beginning. The army of orcs is coming fiercely, and the northern countries may not escape this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future of the Liboron family is now in your hands. Remember, no matter what, the family inheritance cannot be broken! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Earl Langton's whole body dimmed. Originally, I wanted to lead the family further in this chaotic world, but I didn't expect that the Liboron family would be out of the game just at the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, come with us! Without you, the few of us alone would not be able to support the Liboron family.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eldest son's words did not shake Earl Langton's determination. She looked at her son kindly, and shook her head directly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can leave, but I can't. Nobility is not only an honor, but also a responsibility and obligation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a lord, I must live and die with the territory. If you leave at this time, you should know what it means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Well, you are not a child anymore, you have to learn to face all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I cannot make House Liboron more honorable in my hands, but neither can I shame the ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has been going on for so long, and there are not a few nobles who died in battle. Others can die for the family, and I am no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's almost time, go get ready! In the days to come, I will not be by your side, and everything can only depend on you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few people outside who are concerned about the inheritance of the Leboron family. Even some old relatives and friends from the past may not be reliable now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After leaving here, you must be careful in your actions. Don't rush for success, there is never a lack of opportunities in troubled times. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to die, and Earl Langton is no exception. But there was no other way, the obligation of \"responsibility for guarding the soil\" forced him to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when fighting against aliens, if he dares to run with him, he will be hunted down by the Human Alliance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, take care!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As a veteran aristocrat, how could he not have some secret means!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being unable to stop the advance of the orc army does not mean that it cannot cause trouble for the orcs. If you can't survive by yourself, you naturally want to pull the enemy back as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jie Jie...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After so many years, someone finally came. The boy of the Liboron family, maybe your ancestor died early, so I forgot to tell you, the grievances between me and your family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eerie voice makes one's scalp tingle. Phantoms flying all over the sky, the wind that rolled up blew out the oil lamp in Earl Langton's hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't need to worry about my ancestors. This time, I came here to see if you, the lich who once galloped the mainland, has died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since your old man is living a good life, I am relieved. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, in short, you can go out soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liboron family is about to disappear, and the grievances left by the ancestors are naturally not important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a junior, I can't lose my manners. I heard that you liches like to kill the most and eat blood as food, so I will give you a blood meal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hope you are satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have prepared all the materials needed to cast the Undead Scourge for you. There are corresponding formations in multiple nodes in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I open the seal, you can use it to your heart's content!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to cover the entire city of Bethel in order to highlight your great wizard card. It is estimated that if you kill everyone who enters the city, you will be able to regain your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I won't be able to see it this day. The key to open the seal has already merged with me, and the moment I die is when you will see the sun again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Langton said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seemed that he really put life and death aside, but the slight hesitation in the palm of his hand betrayed his inner unwillingness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had a choice, he would never release this old monster. But there is no way, the orc army has besieged the city of Bethel, and there is no reinforcements at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the secret passage leads to the outside of the city, it is still unknown whether it can escape the sight of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to make a big noise to attract the attention of the orc army, so that they can't pay attention to the small miscellaneous fish outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lich in front of him is undoubtedly a good pawn. Once the natural disaster of the undead comes out, the army of orcs who enter the city must suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now many orc troops have entered the outer city. According to his estimation, this wave can at least kill thousands of elite orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next thing is the problem of the orc and this lich. No matter who wins or loses, it has nothing to do with him, a dead man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boy of the Liboron family, although I know that you just want to use my power to avenge you, I like this gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your ancestors could be so enlightened. Why bother?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, as long as I can regain my freedom, the grievances between us will be wiped out. As long as I don't meet you in the future, I won't kill your descendants. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old lich thought he was generous in his promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't meet, don't kill\", if this is considered a promise, it is estimated that people in the whole continent can make such a promise to their enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then I will be on behalf of the younger generation, thank you for your kindness! The younger generation still has something to do, so let's go first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Langton responded angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dealing with these dark creatures with twisted hearts is exhausting. Everyone believes in completely different ideas, and it is difficult to communicate normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boy of the Liboron family, don't leave in a hurry! I think you have amazing talent and amazing bones, and you are the most suitable for being a lich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about it, why don't you let the old man be your guide, help you complete the transformation into a lich, and live from now on…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the old lich finished speaking, Earl Langton turned around and left the secret room. Ordinary people don't know what a lich is, so how can a noble like him not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the lifespan is long, as long as no one finds the phylactery, it can easily live for thousands of years, or even longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no free lunch in the world. If you can increase your lifespan for thousands of years, it is estimated that there are liches everywhere on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of life, morality is never worth mentioning. In order to prolong life, the elderly nobles can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to the problem is that in the process of transforming a soul into a lich, not only the essence of life is changed, but even the soul will be distorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one has ever been able to retain everything in life after being transformed into a lich. Even if some memory can be retained, it will not play any substantial role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even I am not myself anymore, such a long life naturally has no meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back to the barracks, Earl Langton ordered indifferently: \"Send down the order to distribute the holy water to every soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the soldiers that the Lord of Dawn is with us. Even if you die in battle, your soul will enter the Kingdom of God after death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs continue to attack tomorrow, we will fight them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Release an old lich, how can you do it without making some preparations in advance. It's all right to follow his subordinates and take everyone to die together, and let everyone's souls have no peace after death, that would be too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the boy finished speaking, the older young man interrupted softly: \"From now on, don't talk. If you have any questions, wait until you are in a safe place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brothers and sisters are too young to understand now. Uncle, I trouble you to use magic to put them into a coma, so as not to disturb the strong orcs above. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical nervousness is too much, a narrow and long secret room, the probability of a strong orc just above the head is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they happen to meet, the chances of being able to detect the movement below are very slim due to the noise in the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is an extraordinary period, and the hope of the Liboron family is all in this secret passage. Be careful, there is always nothing wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man nodded slightly, and a sleeping spell was released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were not a few little guys making trouble, and the rest were adults, all of them were extraordinarily quiet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them were holding weapons and wearing armor. If not for the sad faces on their faces, no one would know that this was a fleeing team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Advance quietly along the secret road, half an hour later, the sound of rushing water rang in everyone's ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around, it is a dark underground river. Obviously, the ancestors of the Leboron family put a lot of effort into site selection when they built the Bethel fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The existence of the underground river not only solves the water source problem in the city, but also serves as a golden escape route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no such thing, it will take tens of miles to escape the orc army outside the city by manually digging tunnels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure manual excavation, this kind of engineering volume, does not have decades of effort, I am afraid it will not be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's take a break first, the exit of this dark river is not far away. It is estimated that it is only about ten miles away from the orc camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go out now, it's hard not to be spotted by enemy scouts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are at least three Thousand Eagles in the orc camp. Once their tracks are exposed, even the Griffon Cavalry will find it difficult to escape their pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for your father's signal first, and after he finds a way to hold back the orc army, we will take a boat from here to break through. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the place pointed by the old man, there are impressively made canoe boats. It's just that these ship sides are very short from the water surface, only a dozen centimeters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a person sits on it, the distance from the water is even narrower. If a fat person goes up, it may sink directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal structure of the boat is not for people to sit, but for people to lie down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you look at it, don't pinch it. It gives the impression that this is not prepared for the living, but more like it is prepared for the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one explanation for this unique design: the space above the water surface of the dark river is very limited, and the height of the ship can only be lowered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of a collision, these fleeing canoes can instantly become their coffins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly a water monster appeared on the surface of the river. He glanced at everyone, as if he was confirming something. After a while, he said slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is nothing wrong with the blood, how come your Leboron family has declined so quickly, it has only been a hundred years, and it is time to run for your life in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the strength of your juniors, you are not too weak. It should not be difficult to keep the family business. Could it be that the outside world is changing so fast. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is it not weak, this team of more than a hundred people is a strong force anywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides the children, the weakest remaining are mid-level magicians. Most of the guards have the strength of high-level knights, and there are even a dozen silver knights and golden knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three elders headed by them are either magisters or earth knights. Wherever it is placed, it is a strong party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Senior Kerondo, the city of Bethel has been invaded by orcs. The Liboron family has been defeated, and now they can only survive by cutting off their tails.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leboron family, the next head of the family, Anthony, please see us for the sake of our ancestors, and give us a ride! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the young man had already stepped forward and bowed to the monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, boy Anthony. Don't do these things for me, the old man has an agreement with your ancestors, so it can be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the ugly words are up front, I am only responsible for sending you out from here. The rest of the matter is your own business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grievances between the human race and the orcs, you should settle it yourself, don't even think about involving me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever you decide to leave, just lie on the boat by yourself, and I will see you off. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, regardless of whether everyone agreed or not, the gleaming monster dived directly into the water, showing its attitude with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by bursts of shouts of killing, the **** Bethel defenders finally reached the brink of collapse. Watching the soldiers around him fall one after another, Earl Langton slowly drew out his long sword.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, they did not rush to attack, but led the soldiers back slowly, deliberately leading the orc army into the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the legendary Lich King is powerful, he has been sealed away for countless years, and he can still retain some of his strength. Earl Langton has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the undead natural disaster mainly depends on the strength of the caster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they helped to arrange a lot of auxiliary small formations in advance, because of the war, no one can tell how many of them will be effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make death more valuable, Earl Langton resolutely chose to resist every step, luring the orc army to pursue him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident. Earl Langton's dazzling armor soon attracted the attention of an orc officer, and he personally led the army to chase after him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Humans surrender quickly, it will be guaranteed that you will not be reduced to food after you surrender!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the surrender of the orc officer in front of him, Earl Langton laughed. The orc's promise, if it can be trusted, even the sows can climb the tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orc really accepts the captive, he will not surrender at this time. If he really wanted to survive in the world, he would have escaped from the secret way a long time ago, why should he stay until now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Earl Langton had already rushed out with his sword in hand, showing his attitude with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hacking to death more than a dozen Ursar soldiers in a row, he finally angered the Ursa master hidden in the ranks, and directly attacked Earl Langton with a sharp blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He could have avoided it, but Earl Langton, who had long been determined to die, waited for this moment, and instead of avoiding it, he took the initiative to meet him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the body was separated, and at the moment of his death, the **** battlefield was suddenly filled with a gust of wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The temperature in the city began to plummet, and the hot sweat on the forehead suddenly turned into cold sweat. The strange change made countless people feel at a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone could react, the originally bright sky suddenly became dark. Countless fallen corpses slowly began to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the rising black mist in the sky, the orc priest who was fighting outside the city suddenly exclaimed: \"Undead sky!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for any hesitation, he hurried straight to Xiong Huang's tent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, quickly order the troops in the city to withdraw. Someone is releasing the natural disaster of the undead. Look at the range of the undead sky, and the caster must have at least a great magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the multiple augmentation formations that the enemy has deployed in the city, this undead natural disaster may be able to wake up all the soldiers who died in battle in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I want to stop it, but it is too late in time. only...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't had time to say the following words. The originally rising black mist suddenly solidified, and the natural disaster of the undead was successfully cast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the orc priest expected, all the corpses in the city stood up except for the soldiers carrying the holy water. They picked up their weapons from the ground one after another, and pointed their butcher knives at their former comrades-in-arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A new round of melee has begun. The orc officers and soldiers who had just won a big victory were stunned by the scene in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the army, Hudson, who is rushing to the Fort of Flying Bear, is enjoying the scenery along the way at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, the new 23rd Army Corps is holding back, and the marching speed cannot be increased, so it can naturally be distracted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also one of the reasons why he asked the bureaucrats in the logistics department for the magic crystal cannon. After all, the marching speed has been slowed down by his teammates, and there is not much room to slow down if he wants to go down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Legion Commander, a black cloud appears in the northeast direction, and it seems that someone is performing the natural disaster of the undead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the orderly pulled Hudson back from playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Undead Scourge\" is not a small thing. Although it does not have the power to destroy the world as in the legend, its lethality and destructive power are still amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    did not appear often, mainly because of the harsh conditions for casting spells. Not only does it need to consume a lot of precious materials, but it is also necessary to choose a suitable casting location.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally, areas that have just experienced a war, or are in the process of a war, are most suitable for undead natural disasters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opening the map and checking the location, Hudson quickly determined that the battlefield was near the Bethel Fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, the distance between the two parties is at least fifty or sixty miles. Even if he wanted to go over to help, it was too late in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood! Send someone to continue to pay close attention, and Tan Ma should not get too close for the time being.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bethel Fortress is not far from Flying Bear's Fort, only forty miles away. If something goes wrong in Bethel City, the pressure on Flying Bear Castle will be great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the orcs get their brains flooded and like to push them all the way, Flying Bear's Fort will be the next target to be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regret is useless. There are military orders on the battlefield like a mountain, and since the task is coming, it must be carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I'm back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A cry soared into the sky, even in the deep secret passage, it can be heard clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The opportunity has come, let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Anthony turned over and lay down in the canoe without any muddle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the tears at the corners of his eyes revealed the sadness in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The birth of a sealed lich means that his father is dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To open the seal of the ancestors, it is not enough to just get the key, there must also be a blood sacrifice from the direct descendants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The canoe moved forward slowly, and the road to escape officially opened, and the curtain came to an end for the once prominent Leboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there will be a day to regain the family business, but that is the beginning of another legendary story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The phantom gradually solidified, and the Lich, who had broken free from the cage, was stunned by the scene in front of him as soon as he opened his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of murderous orc masters came to him, surrounded him, and started to attack without a word of nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in explaining. Just looking at the undead orcs in the city, you can tell that he has...caused trouble again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he was cursed, but since he became the Lich King, he's either on the way to trouble or in trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct consequence was that it was hunted down by the whole continent, until it was severely injured more than a hundred years ago, and was sealed by the ancestors of the Leiboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been silent for a hundred years, and finally waited until the end of the Liboron family. It had just ushered in a new life and was besieged by powerful orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, he had already greeted Earl Langton's family. If that guy hadn't died so badly, he would have picked out Earl Langton and turned him into an undead, burning his soul every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the enemy's overwhelming attack, the Lich King instantly woke up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He just broke into the orc's den, and the guys who besieged him in front of his eyes were the lowest in strength and comparable to the earth knights of the human race. (7)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the most powerful one has reached the level of the sky knight, and it is a proper killer in the world. (8)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to a dozen orc warriors, there are also three orc priests, all of whom are comparable to human magisters. (7)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing such a lineup, not to mention that he has just recovered, even in the period of complete victory, he is still cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the bonus of Undead Sky, just at that moment, he, the Lich King, would have confessed here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop it, we have something to talk about!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unbelievable that such words come from the mouth of a lich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Lich King knew that, facing so many strong men, even the undead sky could not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has long been bored with the small black room where he has been squatting for hundreds of years, and he does not want to come here again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is no second chance, the phylactery is the lifeblood of a lich, but it doesn't mean that if you can't find this thing, you can't obliterate a lich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the process may be a little troublesome, but with the hatred he has drawn out, it is reckoned that these strong orcs in front of him will not mind spending a little time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hmph! I only know regret now, it's too late, so let's obediently save my life!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was responding with his mouth, but the work at hand did not stop, clearly intending to kill them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The negotiation went bankrupt, and in the blink of an eye, the Lich King's unsolidified body was severely injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The undead canopy that brought the bonus of combat power has also become precarious at this moment, and may collapse at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brutal battle completely enraged the Lich King, and after the anger gradually faded into his brain, he burst out, \"You forced me to do this!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, all the experienced orcs retreated one after another, but it was too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lich King's self-destruction seemed to be a fuse, and the entire Bethel Fortress exploded, like a mushroom cloud soaring into the sky, clearly visible dozens of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city of Bethel was gone, and the orc army that entered the city was also buried. Even the orc army camp outside the city was affected by the explosion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire city is a huge self-destruction formation, and the self-destruction Lich King is just an introduction. It has to be sighed at the generosity of the ancestors of the Liboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with such an explosion, the orcs who participated in the siege were not able to please.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relatively fragile three orc priests lost their bones, and all the orc warriors also suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the explosion, only one person was able to stand up. Among the dozens of people who participated in the battle together, only three were able to cry on the ground, and the rest were still alive or dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The astonishing explosion shocked the Xiongrenhuang who commanded the army outside the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patted the dust on his head, without caring about tidying up his appearance, in a panic, he hurriedly ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone in to search for survivors!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this battle, the bear tribe suffered a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at the ruined city in front of you, you can tell that there are hardly any survivors among the soldiers who entered the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of soldiers is doomed to be irreparable. But the strong men sent into the city still need to send people to search and rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back, the tents that stretched for more than a dozen miles were now bare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wails could be heard all over the ground, obviously the orc army outside the city was also affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific losses have not yet been counted, but the Bear Emperor is sure that this is the heaviest loss for the Orc Empire since the start of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the heaviest loss in this wave is still his bear court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he knew that there was such a great horror in the Bethel Fortress, he would never choose this place as a breakthrough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The border of the Principality of Moxi stretches for hundreds of miles. Where does an attack come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to regret, this battle was completed under the leadership of the Xiongren Royal Court. The main force participating in the siege is also the Bearman heavy infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't take much thinking to know that the elite army responsible for the main attack on Bethel City is now scrapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next thing to consider is not how to restore the combat effectiveness of the legion, but whether to cancel the formation of the legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he has a bit of a little cleanliness, and he disliked the **** battles in the city, so he didn't rush to move the camp to the outer city, otherwise the loss would be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What troubled Xiong Renhuang was not only his own heavy losses, but also an explanation to his allies. The Yingman Air Force who came to assist also suffered heavy losses in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three Yingren 1,000-man flight regiments moved to the outer city yesterday. Except for the Yingren soldiers who went out to patrol, the rest were taken away by a wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't handle this well, and you want air power assistance from your allies in the future, it won't be as simple as it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shocking explosion also caught Hudson's attention. For this reason, Bear Stearns went over with a photo stone to see what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unknown is the scariest thing. An explosion of this level, even if it's just the aftermath, can kill him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, let the rough-skinned and thick-skinned Bears board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the defensive power of the Earth Bear, the group attack with dispersed power hardly poses much threat, and its ability to resist beating is absolutely top-notch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the picture of the ruins recorded in the photo stone, Hudson's face changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is it that can destroy a city?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forbidden spell, magic circle, or maybe something else?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, in Hudson's memory, there is no way to create an explosion of this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, do you see something?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strength determines vision, and weak knights and mages like him can't see their reputation, which doesn't mean that Bear Stearns can't see problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you say it, he is also a bear of \"family origin\". Relying on the inheritance of the ancestors from generation to generation, they have accumulated a lot of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The aura of a lich remains on the battlefield, and there are many torn apart undead soldiers. It is estimated that there is a lich who participated in the battle just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the explosion, it should be that the owner of the city pre-buried a large number of self-explosive magic circles, which detonated after the city was broken. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said nonchalantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the cub is not paying attention to the pieced magic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of formation with scattered power is not very lethal to rough-skinned guys, but it is a big killer on ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to set up a self-explosive magic circle, but it is only for small magic circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time Hudson has heard of such a thing that multiple magic circles are connected in series and detonated at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be promoted on a large scale, it is estimated that the orcs will have to worry about attacking the city in the future. If you don't check it five, six, seven, eight times, the main force will not dare to enter the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that it was done by his own people, Hudson's hanging heart was relieved. I was worried about whether the orc army would come to intercept them separately, but now I don't need to worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just from the pictures on the photo stone, it can be seen that the orcs must have suffered heavy losses this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss is not only the number of soldiers killed in battle, but also the blow to the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is a normal creature, fear is unavoidable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the big explosion just now will be branded deep in the hearts of countless orcs and become an indelible mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't say anything, but deep down in his heart, Hudson couldn't help applauding the Liboron family. This wave is really beautiful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, there is no more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army suffered heavy losses, and it was indeed the best time to pick up a bargain, but the problem was that Hudson couldn't do it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two sides is tens of miles, and when the infantry passed slowly, they would have recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry raid is the best choice, but unfortunately he only has one cavalry regiment in his hands, not a cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small number of people coming together, someone said it was a bargain, and it was the Lord of Dawn's blessing not to be killed by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The luck of Anthony and his party is obviously not very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after coming out of the dark river, after walking less than 30 miles, they encountered the Beamon cavalry who came to check after hearing the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't need too much language, just a word \"kill\" can perfectly explain the relationship between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many masters in the Leboron family, compared with the Beamon cavalry in front of us, the difference in numbers is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the great plains of Yimapingchuan, those with two legs are destined to be unable to run with four legs, not to mention carrying a few oil bottles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't walk, you can only fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on strong personal force, the two sides fought back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as time went by, the disadvantage of the number of people gradually became apparent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the large number of Beamon cavalry, even though the strength of the Leibolong family is not weak, they are gradually showing signs of decadence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the guards die one by one, Anthony's heart was bleeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all the painstaking efforts of the Leiboron family, and without more than ten or twenty years of effort, they cannot be cultivated at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the family is in catastrophe, there will be no way to replenish new blood for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every time a person is lost, it will be more difficult for the Leiboron family to rebuild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the protection of these masters, not to mention rebuilding the family, it is unknown whether the brothers can survive the troubled times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to be anxious. As the new Patriarch, his own strength is also very limited. Even if he participates in the battle, he will not be able to play much role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching his subordinates keep falling down, the Beamon officer riding on the beast gradually became gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continuous fighting, the number of Beamon soldiers killed in battle has reached three digits, and they are almost catching up with the casualties of a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for his intuition that he had caught a big fish in this wave, he wouldn't have brought his men to die here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wanted to rush up several times, but I finally suppressed the idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his strength is not weak, there are also masters among the enemies. If he is accidentally overshadowed by the opponent's masters, it will be another tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seems to have noticed something, the aloof Beamon officer was overjoyed, and immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go and catch those children first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalry, who received the order, instantly changed their target and rushed straight to the children who were guarded by everyone behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcing the guards to intercept separately, the three old men who didn't realize it looked at each other, only to see the two earth knights suddenly leave the team, and shouted: \"Get out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The figure flew out and went straight to Officer Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goals of the two sides are surprisingly consistent, and they are both rushing to \"capture the king\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the Beamon cavalry along the way hurriedly intercepted it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the enemy approaching, Officer Bimon sneered, raised his sword and went straight to meet him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why I was afraid just now was because the enemy still had a magister, and I was worried about being besieged by three people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the enemy's magister is restrained by the cavalry, naturally there is no need to persuade him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they fought, the expressions of the two old men changed drastically. The aura emanating from the Beamon officer in front of him was actually almost the same as theirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With two enemies and one, it should have a big advantage, but unfortunately the enemy is a Beamon knight, and there is a giant beast under him to cooperate with the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the two sides fought on equal terms, and immediately became deadlocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expressions of the two old men continued to be solemn, as if they were worried about the situation of the battle, but the middle-aged Behemoth became more courageous as he fought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a Beamon, the warlike gene has long been implanted in his bones, and evenly matched battles are exactly what he wants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting in life and death can best stimulate the potential of the soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides were busy fighting, and no one noticed the ranger who appeared several miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight: Apprentice Knight, Junior Knight Level 1, Intermediate Knight 2, Advanced Knight 3, Great Knight 4, Silver Knight 5, Golden Knight 6, Earth Knight 7, Sky Knight 8, Sanctuary 9 (Warcraft mounts cooperate with battle)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference between warriors and knights: Awakened life seeds, mounts,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magician: Magic Apprentice, Junior Magician 1, Intermediate Magician 2, Advanced Magician 3, Grand Magician 4, Magister 5, Grand Magister 6, Magister 7, Grand Magister 8, Magic Saint 9\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although he didn't know who the Beamon cavalry besieged and killed, it didn't stop him from joining in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I thought about leading the cavalry to help the venue first, but after some hesitation, I decided to forget it. It's not worth taking risks for a group of strangers who are not close relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the battle is still in a stalemate, and there will be no winner for a while. The most important thing is - the temptation to besiege and kill a Beamon cavalry regiment is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just leading the cavalry regiment over, at most it will help to clear the siege. It is simply impossible to keep the enemy behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has been going on for so long, and Hudson has never heard of it. The Beamon Cavalry Regiment was wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of equal strength, his cavalry regiment is definitely not the opponent of Beamon cavalry in the field alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tan Ma received news that a Beamon cavalry appeared in front of them, surrounding and killing a group of unidentified people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the location in the field, this human team is likely to be the survivors who escaped from the Bethel Fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone heard the explosion just now. It was the nobles of Bethel who used special means to perish together with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They defended the dignity of my human race with their lives. Now that their descendants are being hunted down by orcs, and we happen to run into them, how can they just sit idly by!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if my judgment is wrong, those who were hunted down are also members of my human race. It was always right to save him from the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from Tan Ma, the fighting between the two sides was very fierce, and the number of Beamon cavalry still alive is about eight or nine hundred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A 1,000-man Beamon cavalry regiment, if we want to wipe them out on the battlefield, our cavalry regiment alone is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So I decided to choose 3,000 elites and go out with the cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, Baron Calvo, Baron Reno, Knight Sean, Knight Ball, Knight Feed...The first elite guards, follow me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Berio, Guarente Knight, Nelson Knight, Adrian Knight... You are responsible for staying behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Raquel, if there are nobles willing to participate in the new 23rd Legion, they can also lead elites to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are precious and fast, and those who are named will go to count the soldiers and horses immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without a doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats selected by him are all private troops with strong combat effectiveness, and they all have their own cavalry troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the cavalry regiment in the Wrightshire Army was contributed by these people. This kind of opportunity to gain military exploits cannot be justified without them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three thousand elites are just an imaginary number, mainly based on the number of elites in the hands of these guys, plus the elite veterans of the Mountain Territory, the final approximate data given.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More or fewer people will not have much impact on the final result. The only regret is that the number of war horses is not enough, so we can only use poor horses to make up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the selfless dedication of the bureaucrats in the logistics department, otherwise it would not be easy to get together 3,000 poor horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Hudson has decided to expand the cavalry. This battle is the best opportunity, as long as the Beamon Cavalry Regiment is encircled and wiped out, more battle losses will be reported later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is simply impossible to get to the bottom of it. With outstanding military exploits, even if he knows that there is a problem with the battle damage. The Moxi people still want him to continue working hard, so they will pretend to be confused and add it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, he hasn't eaten alone yet, and the second generation of the newly created 23rd Legion also left a portion. As long as you have the courage to participate, you will gain something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly formed 23rd Army Corps collapsed, because the overall quality of the soldiers was not good enough, and the guards who followed the second generation were still very capable of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loud noise in Bethel city not only alarmed the nearby orc army, but also alarmed the nearby human defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information from the high-altitude reconnaissance of the Griffin Cavalry gathered in the hands of the commander-in-chief of the front line, Marshal Hodge, as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he first received the battle report, he suspected that someone would play a joke on him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liboron family is not a small nobleman. Even if it has been going downhill in recent decades, it is still a veteran nobleman who can be ranked in the top five in the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than a dozen generations, hundreds of years of long-term operation. The Bethel Fortress can be regarded as impenetrable, and in terms of defense capabilities, it can be ranked first in the entire Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge never considered the possibility of falling to such a huge fortress city. At the very least, it shouldn't have fallen into the hands of the orc army at the beginning of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of the Alpha Kingdom, as long as the old nobles don't die, the orcs want to break into their lair, and it is impossible to complete it without a few months of strong attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless not to believe it. The nearby defenders all gave similar battle reports, and personally sent griffin cavalry to investigate, which also proved the fact that the Bethel Fortress was reduced to ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how the orcs breached the Bethel Fortress, no one can tell for a while, but some people speculate that it is related to the shocking explosion, and suspect that it is the work of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Griffin Cavalry's reconnaissance was strong and they discovered that the orc army had suffered heavy losses, which made Marshal Hodge heave a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if it's not the hand of the orcs. If the orcs have the strength to easily destroy a giant fortress, the subsequent battles will be impossible to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Marshal Hodge doesn't even know how to fight the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bethel Fortress fell, and a huge vacuum gap appeared in the originally solid line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From then on, the orc army can drive straight in from here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defenders on both sides can also attack their logistics transportation lines from the fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that the orc army's dependence on logistics is not as serious as that of the human army. In addition to a small amount of strategic materials, they can use local materials for consumption such as eating, drinking, and scavenging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Halley, immediately send a message to the capital to inform the Bethel fortress of the fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell His Majesty the King that our mobile forces are insufficient and we are unable to close the gap in the defense line in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The construction of the follow-up line of defense has not yet been completed, and it is unable to stop the orc army from driving straight in. It is suggested to His Majesty the king to expand the scope of fortifying the wall and clearing the wilderness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to include all the northern provinces of the principality, so as not to leave an opportunity for the orcs to take advantage of. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Marshal Hodge's expression gradually dimmed. \"Strengthening the wall and clearing the wilderness\" is easy to say, but it is not an ordinary difficulty to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most realistic question, after the wall was cleared and the production was completely destroyed, what do you guys eat?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the nobles on the front line, they had the experience of being robbed by orc tribes, and they had enough sense of crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having stored food in the castle early, coupled with the principality's subsidy, quickly completed the clearing of the walls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the area of ​​\"Strengthening the Wall and Clearing the Field\" is expanded, the situation has changed. First of all, the principality's subsidies are difficult to implement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the finances can be supported, there is no way to immediately produce enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is food in the rear, it cannot be guaranteed to be delivered to the castles of the nobles before the orc army arrives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats who are wealthy, have sufficient sense of crisis, and know how to store grain in advance may be able to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But most of the nobles have never thought about this issue at all, or even if they thought about it in advance, they don't have enough financial resources to complete the reserve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, after the outbreak of the war, the nobles in the northern region also had a wave of panic buying of food, but only wealthy nobles were eligible to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost impossible for the poor to have more than two or three years of grain reserves. After all, as lords, they not only had to support themselves, but also their subjects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autumn harvest has not yet been completed. Once the comprehensive fortification of the walls and the clearing of the fields are implemented, the food production will be cut off. Maybe it will not last until the next year, and some people will run out of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot solve the food shortage caused by the strong walls and clearing the fields. Even if the king makes an order, it is difficult to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know, you know, Marshal Hodge is still powerless. Who could have predicted in advance that Bethel Fortress, which was least likely to be lost, would be the first to fall?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he could do nothing but scold Earl Langton for being useless and the Leblon family for their vain reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to settle accounts after the fall, you have to be alive. Judging from the news received so far, there is no evidence that Earl Langton has run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they didn't run away and chose to live and die with the territory, no matter how big the mistake was, they could only be forgiven.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in the final accountability, there is a high probability that he, the frontline commander, will be responsible. The charges are all off the shelf—rescue is not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Imprisonment is impossible. As long as the king is not mad, he will not touch the commander-in-chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, Marshal Hodge took over the mess when he was ordered in a crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking office, although he didn't have any outstanding achievements, at least he completed the construction of the new line of defense, holding back the orc army for two months before being torn apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the previous defenders of the Augustsburg defense line, they are all top students at first glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to change people, you have to have a more powerful commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of the crisis of national subjugation and genocide, all disputes have to be left behind. Even his political opponents would spit twice at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really quits, the most anxious ones will be the gang of dignitaries in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person, very aware of the current situation. If it can run, it is estimated that the transnational immigration movement has already been in full swing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the free people can run away, but the nobles can't. Not only can they not run away, even the younger generations can't run away either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you fail to fulfill your noble duties, not only will your ancestral foundation be lost, but you will also have to face the pursuit of the entire Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to escape for your life, it's not like you don't have a chance. But you have to wait until the situation completely collapses before you can make a strategic shift with the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, this kind of strategic shift usually involves going to a province that is easy to defend, and continuing to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There can be exile, but in the face of the orc invasion, so far no king has set this precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it was the Guangming Empire that ruled the north three hundred years ago. Even if it didn't suppress the Orc Empire, it wouldn't be a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, the Alpha Kingdom is another **** nail shop. There are many kings who died in battle, but there are really no kings in exile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, it was just one relocation of the capital again and again. Even if they go abroad under special circumstances, they will return soon and continue to host the resistance movement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this tenacious attitude, the Alpha Kingdom won the respect of the Terran Alliance. With the support of all countries, they have been resurrected with full blood again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pausing for a moment, as if thinking of something, Marshal Hodge hastily ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Chief of the guard, immediately send someone to convey the news of the fall of the Bethel Fortress to the legions that are changing defenses as quickly as possible.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, cold sweat broke out on Marshal Hodge's forehead. Almost ignored the most critical issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the changing army is unprepared and encounters the orc army in the wild, the consequences are unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was a loud noise when the Bethel Fortress fell, the nearby human army should be vigilant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge still chose to remind him again. After all, when the forest is big, there are all kinds of birds; when there are many armies, there are also commanders of all kinds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at everyone is usually smart, but that's just political. Some people's military literacy is really hard to show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though these aristocratic officers received military education from an early age, it still cannot change the fact that some of them have terrible military skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Learning military knowledge only allows them to learn mechanically and mechanically, and they cannot use this military knowledge flexibly at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure talent is like the difference between a classmate and a scumbag. Those who are good are really good, and those who are not good are really bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the troops to go out in a mighty way, when he was about to approach the target, Hudson waved his hand: \"The order goes down, and everyone wraps the horseshoes with cloth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we will act separately. The cavalry regiment will follow me to copy the enemy's rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, Baron Calvo, and Baron Reno, you all have experience in commanding cavalry combat, so the three teams will be entrusted to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Members of the newly formed 23rd Legion also attacked from the front together with the cavalry led by Baron Kelette.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity is rare. It is rare that a single Beamon cavalry regiment is sent to the door. We must take them all down. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but when giving orders, Hudson always feels wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lone Beamon Cavalry Regiment\", it seems that when the Beamon Cavalry moves, most of them are in regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a frontal field battle, a 1,000-man Bimon cavalry regiment can defeat an ordinary human army of 10,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like the newly formed 23rd Army, the combat effectiveness of the new regiment is not bad, and there is a high probability that it will not be able to stop a charge of the Beamon Cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you encounter the main force of the human race, even if you can't win, you can still run. It is rare to think that this kind of chance to miss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the horseshoes were wrapped, when the army was about to approach, they were still discovered by the warring parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to hide, they all appear within sight, no matter how much you hide, you can't hide them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combining the power of the two families, nearly 5,000 troops encircled them on all sides. From a distance, the mountains and plains are full of human cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Reinforcements are coming!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony was the first to discover all this, and shouted in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally at a disadvantage, the guards of the Leiboron family, who were in danger, instantly boosted their morale!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of where the reinforcements come from, as long as it is a human army, when facing the orc army, everyone is their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the situation is over, the Beamon officer, who had no intention of fighting, immediately threw off his opponent and ordered: \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it was too late. The human cavalry appeared in their sight, and their figures were also exposed in the sight of Hudson and his group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After fighting for so long, half of the guards of the Leiboron family fell down. Now that the opportunity for revenge has come, how can they let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hold them, don't let this group of Bimons escape!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that two legs cannot catch up with four legs, but there is still a kind of power in this world—magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several magicians holding magic cores to replenish their magic power, no longer caring about their own consumption, took out their abilities at the bottom of the box and released slowing spells on the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this magic is not easy to use. While slowing down the enemy, it often also affects the speed of action of one's own people, making it impossible to achieve precise strikes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no waste magic, there are only waste magicians. In special occasions, the slow technique can also play a big role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short delay, the distance between the two sides has been shortened to only a few hundred meters, and the encirclement is closed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoosh whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's signature arrow has already flown towards the Beamon cavalry. In an instant, four unlucky behemoths fell from the giant beast to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that some cavalry have taken out the magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't launch, it was because the distance was too far, and it was impossible to aim while the cavalry was running.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting rid of the entanglement, the Beamon cavalry who wanted to forcibly break through became the first victims. Before rushing up, he was directly shot into a sieve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Beamon cavalry who had been hit by multiple crossbow arrows, Hudson secretly cursed \"prodigal son\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest feature of the magic crossbow is that it is expensive, and even the arrows must be specially made. Although the Principality of Moxi is responsible, it cannot be wasted casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, such scarce resources cannot be bought with money. Even if the Principality of Moxi has a rich family background, it is impossible to have too many reserves in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the replenishment is not available, these magic equipment will become luxury toys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to worry about these things. The hundreds of desperate Beamon cavalry on the field can bring a lot of losses to the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalrymen died, and the beasts under them became crazy. In the blink of an eye, Hudson saw several rough horse cavalry being attacked by war beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any hesitation, Hudson hastily replenished the arrows for the mad Lordless Beast, and at the same time ordered the cavalry under his command: \"Kill together with the Beast, don't leave any survivors!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he is also very envious of this Beamon beast. It's a pity that in the continent of Aslante, there has never been a precedent for humans to domesticate Beamon beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the common saying in the mainland, Behemoth Beast and Behemoth live and die together, if the Behemoth knight loses and dies in battle, the Beast will soon follow to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    True or false cannot be verified, but Hudson does not think he can do things that countless predecessors could not do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of their outstanding performance just now, or because they ordered to expose their commander's identity, a group of Beamon cavalry chose to get rid of the entanglement of their opponents and rushed towards Hudson's position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In deep siege, \"Capture the King\" is undoubtedly the best choice to break the predicament. Hudson expressed his sincere appreciation for the super high military literacy shown by the Mongolian cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially if these guys choose him as a breakthrough point, it needs to be praised. After all, the iron plate on this side of the court is the hardest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of running from the weak point, they came to kick the hardest iron plate. It can only be said that this Beamon cavalry was very lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without ordering, the crossbowmen consciously aimed at the charging Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every step forward is paved by Beamon Knight with his life. It was getting closer and closer, and the archers, who had long been impatient, also started their own performances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After two rounds of cavalry and shooting, the Beamon cavalry, who were supposed to enter close combat, suddenly found something was wrong. It seemed that the speed of their war beast suddenly slowed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the enemy's arrow rain, the forward speed is suddenly reduced, and the consequences are absolutely disastrous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, teams of cavalrymen appeared in front of Hudson with spears in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The encirclement became smaller and smaller, and the members of the Leboron family who had fought hard with the Beamon cavalry gradually withdrew from the battlefield, leaving the stage to the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that the situation is not good, the face of the middle-aged Beamon officer turned livid. Intuition told him that \"capturing the king\" this time was a wrong decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to retreat, and the signal for help has been fired. But this place is still dozens of miles away from the nearest orc army camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the Yingren Air Force who had the opportunity to come to support, even if the rest of the army rushed over, they could only collect their bodies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the magic crossbow in the enemy's hand, he knew that even if the Eagle Air Force came over, it didn't seem to have much effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if he had made up his mind, the middle-aged Beamon officer's eyes were filled with blood, and his aura suddenly rose. Regardless of the rain of arrows, he lifted the special knight gun in his hand and jumped up to take Hudson's life. Door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Closer, closer!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when the knight spear was less than 30 centimeters away from Hudson, it stopped suddenly, and it couldn't stab anymore anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could react, a huge bear paw appeared in front of him, and then he flew upside down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mouthful of blood spurted out, and the middle-aged Beamon was completely dumbfounded! At the cost of greatly injuring his vitality, the blow he got in exchange ended up like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to trade his life for his life, kill Hudson to disrupt the human coalition forces, and win a chance for his subordinates to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the final result is that his body is full of arrows, while Hudson on the opposite side is unscathed. Looking at him, it seems that he is looking at a clown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enduring the pain by force, the middle-aged Bimon held up his last strength, and unwillingly said in the common language of the mainland: \"The Bimon family, the golden Bimon Royia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human beings, say your name, let me understand! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, I'm not interested in talking nonsense with dead people.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While replying, Hudson did not forget to add an arrow to Royeia, so that the golden Beamon went to meet the beast **** with full of doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The crazy dying struggle only made the failure look more tragic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing a battle in which ants killed elephants, Hudson secretly reminded himself: When fighting with soldiers, you must be more stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Royeia lying on the ground is the best negative teaching material.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the incomparable arrogance that made him lose himself. As long as a few more scouts are left outside to watch out for movements around them, they won't be dumped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Clean up the battlefield immediately, burn the corpses on the spot, and then retreat with the wounded! This place is not far from the orc camp, so the speed of action must be fast.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Annihilating a full-staffed Beamon cavalry regiment, even if it was done at a cheap price, is also something worthy of celebration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the war, it is the first time to wipe out the Beamon Cavalry Regiment. It will definitely be written about by various countries and endowed with special political meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being fond of appearances is the basic quality of a general. Especially when winning battles, it is even more important to remain rational at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he was happy in his heart, Hudson forcibly restrained his emotions in order to maintain a high-quality personality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the commander can restrain his joy, the officers and soldiers below will not be able to do it. Looking at the joyful expressions of each one, you can tell that everyone is very satisfied with this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has already begun to enjoy the dividends brought about by the battle victory. The most direct impact is that his prestige in the army has increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the promise made in the Wright County Legion, but it is also effective for the newly formed 23rd Legion of the Mossi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consecutive victories raised everyone's confidence in him to the peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the command of the new 23rd Army is issued, there is no need for the leader of the Raquel Army to relay it, and the officers below will carry it out spontaneously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, if such a suspected robbery and seizure of power happened, the two sides would have to turn their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is the time of war, and my smart and capable elder brother is surrounded by the orc army, and may be sent to see the Lord of the Dawn at any time. It is too late for Raquel to hug his thigh, so how dare he make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Command, that's a minor issue. From Raquel's point of view, no matter how powerful Hudson is, he is still an outsider, and will not take root in the Principality of Mosi, and taking away the command of the army is only temporary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What he needs most now is to follow along with military achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case my elder brother unfortunately dies, and by the way he completes his fortune, the meritorious deeds accumulated now may be a life-saving medicine at some point in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arranging military affairs, Hudson set his sights on the rescued small team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who are you? Why are you here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson deliberately did things. From a geographical point of view, this place belongs to the subordinate area of ​​Bethel City. Because it is too close to the front line, it has already completed the clearing of the walls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, no one should pass by at this time. If it hadn't been for the fight with the orcs just now, which proved that he was not the spy of the orcs, maybe he would not have been interrogated, but had been captured directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures must be taken. The Principality of Moxi had issued a ban long ago, prohibiting domestic people from entering the war zone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the question, Anthony, who hadn't recovered from his grief, replied indiscriminately: \"We are a passing caravan. We were robbed by orcs and fled all the way here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, the experienced veterans in the team realized that something was going to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This excuse is really too nonsense. There are countless loopholes in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which caravan doesn't even have a carriage?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which caravan has such a strong guard?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which caravan dares to come to the front line at this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too many questions to unravel. Getting together is equivalent to directly telling the other party that there is a problem with their identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. In their current state, if they encountered an unfamiliar army, if their identities were revealed, who knows what would happen?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance of the Liboron family is very attractive. Even old relatives and friends in the past, it is possible to lay hands on them, let alone strangers who have nothing to do with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Randomly put on the hat of a deserter and take them down directly. In this wilderness, there is no chance to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear general, we are the worshipers of the Warren Chamber of Commerce. We were invited by the Irwin family to do business. This is a special pass issued by Viscount John.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old magister also took out a parchment contract document, proving that they were really a caravan, which was a supplement to the loopholes in Anthony's previous words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this scene fell into Hudson's eyes, but it made him doubt the identities of these people more and more. It was so well prepared, as if it had been deliberately arranged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules are all for ordinary people. If you are a member of the four major chambers of commerce in the mainland, it is not a problem to directly get a pass issued by the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time of war. These giant chambers of commerce roaming the mainland can obtain a large amount of strategic materials, and they are guests wherever they go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are not doing business with the orcs, you will greet the frontline generals in advance, and everyone will give them face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Really, I happen to be going to Flying Bear Castle to change defense, so let's go together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Viscount John died in battle, but with the reputation of the Irwin family, the business can still continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have an accident on the road, as long as you explain the situation in the past, as well-mannered nobles, they can understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to thank me, it's all a matter of convenience. Going out and being convenient to others is also convenient to oneself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson turned around and left without giving the old man a chance to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hide your identity, it doesn't matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know these guys, which doesn't mean that the nobles of the new 23rd Legion don't know either. There were more than forty survivors, and he didn't believe that all of them were hidden in the dark and never showed their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a person is recognized, their identity is revealed. It will be too late to consider the issue of disposal at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hidden conspiracy, so naturally it cannot be hidden from everyone. Watching Hudson leave, Anthony said annoyedly: \"It's all my fault for being so flustered, what should uncle do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It has nothing to do with you, after all, our plan is not thorough enough. As far as the strength of our group is concerned, no matter what identities we use to cover up, people will find something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all saw the battle just now. From beginning to end, the entire battle process was very crisp and neat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troops with such combat effectiveness are rare in the entire Principality. Even the most elite troops in the family can't guarantee to do better than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the accents of these people, they are probably from the Alpha Kingdom. The general who came to question him just now should be the Earl of Yueluowan who was recently conferred by the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many legends about this person. It is impossible to verify whether the rumors are true or not, but one thing is certain, this earl is very powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being targeted by this person, the reasons we prepared in advance may not be fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I found an acquaintance in the crowd just now. If we weren't too embarrassed now, I'm afraid we would have exposed our identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we will act together with the army, and it is only a matter of time before our identity is revealed. Instead of being suspected after being exposed, it is better to go directly to the showdown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have no grievances with this Earl of Hudson in the past, and we have no hatred in recent days. Thinking about it, he wouldn't kill us for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Liboron family can't stand the toss. If the conditions are not excessive, it should be regarded as a gift of thanks for saving this life. Hope this one is as upright as the rumors say, and don't eat too much. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old magister said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A plucked peacock is not as good as a chicken. The current Leboron family is a plucked peacock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the family has been greatly damaged, and the inheritance of the deep heritage of the Leibolong family has become a child holding a gold brick in a busy market, and will be missed wherever he goes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After cleaning the battlefield and counting the casualties and gains, Hudson is very satisfied with the one-to-two exchange ratio.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The target of this exchange is the Beamon cavalry. Throughout the entire continent of Aslante, there are not many troops that can fight them head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that the exchange ratio is one to two, even if it is two to one, it is still a great joy for the human race to celebrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this battle report is full of water. The Beamon cavalry who were killed earlier were also counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson wants to embezzle their military exploits, it's entirely because these people themselves gave their identity as \"caravan\". Since it is a caravan, the action of the coalition forces is to rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the rescued party, it would be nonsense to share the military exploits. The rules of the game cannot be broken, and Hudson can only accept this exploit silently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The photo stone recording is completed, and a fire is set, which is considered to be a successful end to the encirclement and annihilation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it was too far away, or because I realized it later, when the army withdrew, the eagle scouts appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemies who came to the door, how could Hudson be polite to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lifting the bow, nodding the arrow, aiming, and the arrow flying out, the whole process was nothing without the slightest lag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the sound of arrows piercing the air, the eagle scouts in the sky fell directly in response, and their bodies were smashed into flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others bend their bows to shoot big eagles, but Hudson can only bend their bows to shoot big eagles. But this feeling is still pretty good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that after the eagles were hit by arrows, they fell like a boulder falling from the sky, and the damage was not small at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a moment ago, a poor horse was unfortunately hit by a Yingman who fell from the sky, and it died directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is considered good luck. If you are unlucky, you will inevitably go to the Kingdom of God to listen to the teachings of the Lord of Dawn in advance if you hit someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While commanding the evacuation of the army, Hudson did not forget to send good news to Crown Prince Caesar and King Chris IX respectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political sense tells him that both of them need this achievement now. At the moment when the Bethel fortress fell, any victory seemed precious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this classic battle of annihilating the Beamon Cavalry Regiment is worthy of a special book.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson has no idea in his heart. The last encounter with the orc army was blown into a turning point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the situation is more special, and it has more promotional significance. I don't know what it will be called.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the propaganda of the Mosi people has the attribute of a crow's mouth. The last \"Turning Battle\" was publicized, and now a turning point has really taken place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of twist, not what everyone wants. The fall of Bethel Fortress directly caused the situation in Moxi Principality to take a turn for the worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the crow's mouth attribute is used again this time, whether the Principality of Moxi can hold on will become unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on Hudson's understanding of the Moxi Principality, if he wants to mobilize troops in a short period of time to re-establish a fortress to block the orc army, the probability of success will not exceed 30%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good news is still on the way, but the bad news has arrived in Da Pest first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding the battle report from Marshal Hodge and looking at the content recorded above, Chris IX couldn't believe it was true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Liboron family, are they just so useless?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the king's question, everyone lowered their heads. As a veteran aristocrat of the principality, the Leiboron family has always given everyone the impression that they are powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is going downhill, no one dares to underestimate this old family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that this family is relatively salty, has been rooted in the local area and has been working hard, and has little involvement in the affairs of the central government, otherwise, there must be a place for them among the important officials present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having no family members in high positions does not mean that they have no right to speak in the central government. There is still no shortage of relatives, friends, and political allies in the central government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the important officials present can basically have a relationship with the Liboron family. Of course, these people can also be related to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were not many great nobles in the Principality of Moxi. The circle is so big, it is inevitable to marry each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the fall of Bethel Fortress is not only the responsibility of the Liboron family. Compared with the behemoth of the Orc Empire, any noble family is insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the orcs made up their minds to conquer a fortress, it was only a matter of time before it fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the fall of the Bethel fortress, they also sent many letters of appeal to the Principality, detailing the plight they were facing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But due to the constraints of the special situation on the battlefield and the shortage of frontline troops, reinforcements were not sent to them in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation recorded in the photo stone, the Bethel defense battle was fought very cruelly, and the Liboron family has tried their best. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins couldn't help but say a fair word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he has a deeper understanding of the frontline situation than everyone present, and he is very aware of the difficulties of defending the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is miserable enough for people to shroud their bodies in horse leather and stain the city with blood for the principality. It is too unkind to continue to pursue the responsibility of the dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an in-law, he must stand up at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation has developed to this point. We can discuss right and wrong later. The most urgent thing is to do a good job in the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the front line is indeed very bad now. Marshal Hodge made it clear that he does not have enough mobile power to plug the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army already has the ability to drive straight in, and the next war situation will definitely become more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the current situation, we must carefully consider Marshal Hodge's proposal to expand the scope of the strong wall and clear the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience of the Alpha Kingdom, every time the orcs came to an army, they would carry out large-scale fortified walls and clear the wilderness in many provinces in the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before we followed suit and carried out fortification and clearing of some areas. Judging from the current situation, the results are not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these preparations, perhaps what we are facing now is not just an army of more than 600,000 orcs, but an army of millions of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the large-scale implementation of fortifying the wall and clearing the wilderness requires a very heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the food and grass provided by the northern provinces to the front lines are gone, but even the lords and nobles everywhere have to reach out to ask for food from the principality in order to be able to persist for a long time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the good and the bad have been said, but there is no solution to the problem. It's not that Prime Minister Herceg's IQ is not enough, it's just that this is an unsolvable proposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Principality of Moxi has nothing to do with the orc army that caused the culprit, so it can only start with its own family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking out the window, after hesitating for a long time, Chris IX said helplessly: \"According to Marshal Hodge's proposal, execute the fortified wall and clear the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the nobles that the orc army has arrived. The Principality's darkest hour is coming, so prepare them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the invasion of the orc army, the Alpha Kingdom can survive, and so can we.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is rushing to transport food or rush to repair the fort, it is too late in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Migrate the serfs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not necessary to keep everyone buried with them. Except for the young and strong who kept the city guard, the rest were transferred to the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the nobles along the way provide them with supplies, and all consumption will be settled by the principality and them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality only advises on the migration of serfs and does not force them. If the food problem can be solved, all the people can be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the castles and fortresses in the occupied area fell. Facts have proved that our preparations are not enough to withstand the orc's soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scattered garrison will only be easily broken by the enemy. Allow nobles from all over the country to move closer to each other with the county government as a unit, and stick to a strong city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also do not make mandatory orders. If you think you are strong, you can completely garrison your own castle alone, or even take the initiative to fight a decisive battle with the orc army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the order to strengthen the wall and clear the field, the rest of the orders are all suggestions, which is enough to prove the inner contradiction of Chris IX.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strong walls and clear fields are strategic materials. If you don't clean up the crops in the field by yourself as soon as possible, it will be too late when the orc army kills them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how heavy the loss is, it is better than the cheap enemy. The harvested grain is immature and cannot be put into the warehouse. At least it can be fed to the livestock, which can somewhat make up for the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Migration of serfs, this is a big project. Judging from the area with strong walls and clear fields, there are millions of people who need to migrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the feudal era, this is undoubtedly a very crazy decision. Deep down, Chris IX wasn't even sure if it could be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the young and strong were left on the front line, and all the evacuated were old, weak, women and children. Migrating thousands of miles on foot from north to south, the reduction in staff is definitely an astronomical figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heavy losses are better than falling into the hands of the orcs and destroying them all. Although he didn't say it directly, it can be seen from the actual actions that Chris IX's inner hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, he is not optimistic about his own country. If this news gets out, all the nobles of the Principality of Moxi on the front line will burst into tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that migrating serfs is just a necessary means to solve the food problem. In essence, it is still to preserve vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Chris IX's view, it is only a matter of time before the gaps in the defense line appear, and several northern provinces will fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only place that can struggle is the southern province of the principality. Trade space for time, and continue to resist, maybe you can persist until the reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes to counterattack and recover the lost land, these serfs who moved south will be the main force for post-war reconstruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serfs must be preserved as much as possible, and as the nobles who are the foundation of the Principality, they must be saved as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the precedent of the Alpha Kingdom, Chris IX is still very confident that in the future, with the help of the Human Race Alliance, he will recover the lost land and regain the ancestral foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic deployment made now has already paved the way for the future involuntarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi is preparing for the worst, and the political pressure on Crown Prince Caesar has suddenly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no one said it clearly, the fall of Bethel Fortress and the slow movement of the expeditionary force were inevitably linked together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that once the news is sent back to the country, there is a high probability that he will be labeled as a hater of disregarding the overall situation and going his own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If timely remedial action cannot be made, leading to the failure of the strategic mission assigned by the Kingdom, it will not be enough to pay for all the prestige he has accumulated in the early stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are the Mosi people all useless? The gap was torn open by the orcs so quickly, it is simply a defense line of paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is Bethel Fortress that has fallen, so will it be Terence or simply Dapace that will fall next time? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The complaints from the depths of the soul are enough to prove that Crown Prince Caesar is really angry. Judging from the anger on his face, those who didn't know thought he was the crown prince of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the orcs are determined to capture a fortress, and it is almost impossible to defend it with the strength of a noble family alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi people made a mistake in their misjudgment. They underestimated the determination of the orcs to take Bethel Fortress, and failed to provide reinforcements in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slowness of action and inability to control the frontline battle situation are also their chronic diseases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the fall of the former Fort August defense line to the loss of the current Bethel Fortress, this is confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people are unreliable at critical moments, we must learn a lesson, and we must not let the army be trapped in an isolated city. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Jose persuaded earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they are talking about the garrison issue, but they are actually telling the Crown Prince Caesar cryptically: the Mosi people are unreliable, so give up the unreliable plan before!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden sound of \"good news\" interrupted the conversation between the two. Immediately afterwards, the guards handed a sealed document to Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cursory glance at the contents of the good news, Crown Prince Caesar's cloudy face suddenly turned cloudy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This \"good news\" came too timely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bethel Fortress had just fallen and received this turning point. If anyone criticizes the expeditionary force for inaction, he can reply directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not only the first time since the start of the war to encircle and wipe out a full Beamon cavalry regiment in a field battle, even if the time was extended for hundreds of years, such a record was rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the human army can't fight. It's mainly a field war. If you want to carry out annihilation, you must have the right time, place and people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the fighting power of the Beamon cavalry, as long as you don't make mistakes, you can break through and run away even if you can't beat them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A full-stacked Beamon cavalry regiment can be surrounded and annihilated in the wild, which is purely unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, look! The invincible orc army is actually nothing more than that, not as powerful as the Mosi people say.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Crown Prince Caesar had handed the letter of victory to Earl Jose. After all, he was still too young to hold his breath and write his inner thoughts on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing at the contents of the good news, Earl Jose was also shocked, and immediately recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this good news, the political dilemma they faced disappeared in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he ignored the complaints about Crown Prince Caesar. If the orc army was not strong, the three northern countries would not have been passively beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, send the news back to China as soon as possible! It is best to send the news to the capital before the news of the fall of the Bethel Fortress arrives.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is like this, magnifying one's own advantages as much as possible to cover up problems that one does not want to expose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Our troubles are gone, but we still need to pay attention to the Moxi people's request for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they really collapse in advance, even if we have achieved brilliant tactical results, we will not be able to cover up our strategic failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order, starting tomorrow, the marching speed will be increased to forty miles, and strive to rush to the front line as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon family has always been vengeful, and sent someone to remind Earl Hudson to be careful of the orc's revenge. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of interests, the conflict between the first two people is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Titans always have more privileges.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the continuous defeat of others, Hudson's two consecutive victories have a very different status in the eyes of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, he wished Hudson would fall a big somersault, but now there will be no more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Common interests made Crown Prince Caesar abandon his initial prejudice. Even if there is still a estrangement, it will only be kept deep in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all learned from their own father. Even the powerful Caesar III was often stunned speechless in military meetings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the inheritance system monopolized by nobles, the talent base itself is not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a total of 180 large and medium-sized nobles who have the ability to cultivate excellent generals, that is, master core resources, in the entire Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small base, it is not easy to train several capable generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too illusory to expect them to have super high emotional intelligence while being able to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more people have heard and seen since they were young, the better their adaptability will be. With the threat of the orc army, the first element now is to be able to fight, and other problems can be postponed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the battle, they went back to their respective families, and only a few remained in the army to serve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the nobles and generals have returned to their fiefs, and they may not be able to meet the king for ten or eight years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Beamon camp, Crown Prince Alex's face was gloomy and terrifying. A fully formed Beamon cavalry regiment disappeared directly on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an unprecedented event, met by him, a coach with insufficient prestige, is undoubtedly pouring cold water into the frying pan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I just asked Royeia to take people to the bear camp to check it out. Why did it suddenly disappear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competition is still unavoidable within the same five imperial courts. There was a big explosion in the camp of the bear tribe, and each tribe naturally sent people to check it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be impolite to send someone to investigate from the air. If he is killed by someone as a \"human spy\", there is no way to go and reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cautious Crown Prince Alex directly sent a cavalry regiment. Theoretically speaking, such a force is sufficient to deal with any emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, there was an encounter between us and the bear camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just traces on the battlefield, almost all of which were destroyed, and it was impossible to directly determine the identity of the belligerents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the position where Royeia sent out the call for help, the two are almost coincident, and it can be roughly inferred that the fighting party is the cavalry regiment he led.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    About three or four hours after the big bang, the bear people also sent the only remaining eagle people to investigate, and we also found several dead eagle people nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from the dark thread, the bear people suffered heavy losses in the attack on the Bethel fortress. A main army was almost wiped out, and various auxiliary troops lost no less than 30,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, many strong men fell into the enemy's scheme and stayed in Bethel forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be preliminarily judged that it will not be the black hand of the bear people. The other three imperial courts have not sent out the main army recently, so the suspicion can also be ruled out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically, it is certain that the cavalry regiment led by Royia should have been ambushed by the elite human legion before it suffered a tragic disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when they had an accident, a human army passed by nearby. They are the First Legion of the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Army and the new 23rd Legion of the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These two forces have been operating together for some time. The last time the troops sent by the Silver Moon Emperor's Court met them on the way, they were almost wiped out in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With their strength, if they are prepared in advance, they can still eat one of our cavalry regiments. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig analyzed solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Royea was single-handedly promoted by him, and the Beamon Cavalry Regiment he led was also his old department, a proper direct line force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't do anything, just went out to perform a mission, and the entire army was wiped out, which weakened his strength a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for sure that it was an accident, he would have wondered whether Crown Prince Alex was going to kill someone with a knife, and wanted to take the opportunity to cut off his wings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a thought. Although the internal strife of the Bimon clan was bloody, they were not so prodigal that they sent a cavalry regiment to the enemy for the sake of internal strife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire Bimon family has less than 300,000 people, and the loss of a thousand-member group at one time is a major event that needs to be reported to the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happened, and Crown Prince Alex, who is the supreme commander, is also to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long silence, Crown Prince Alex said slowly: \"Your Excellency, I will leave this matter to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find their location and kill them. Use their heads to commemorate our dead warriors! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is not important, the key is to find a target to kill and give the country an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, the enemy's position has been determined. Judging from the direction they are heading, they should go to the Fort of Flying Bear to change defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, now they are almost arriving. It was too late to intercept halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Castle has a longer history than the Principality of Moxi. The fortifications of the city are very strong, and a strong attack cannot be completed overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, we have to be vigilant about the Bethel Fortress. The background of the veteran human nobles must not be underestimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My Bimon family are all cavalry, not good at siege. It is best to find an opportunity to settle with the enemy in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the Fort of Flying Bear is not within the area we are in charge of, and the army needs to negotiate with the bear people to move across the border. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig resolutely refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there is a pit, but still jumping into it is definitely not the act of a wise man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to take advantage of the Beamon cavalry, and only relying on a group of miscellaneous soldiers to attack the enemy's heavily guarded fortress, Butzweig's mind is not broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tasks that are destined to be impossible to complete, naturally cannot be accepted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be seen at a glance that this is a temporary construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the Irwin family put their heart into city defense. It's a pity that their luck was not very good, and the main force of the family was lost on the battlefield early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome Earl Hudson, Viscount Raquel!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hearty voice came from the welcoming team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that from the man's fully armed attire and the army behind him ready to go, it's clear that he is not here to welcome, but more like running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they can't wait for this change of defense, and they don't want to stay on the front line for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are welcome! What do you want?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the topic was brought up, the middle-aged officer was a little embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's normal to switch defenses and leave, but running away in such a hurry is a bit too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. The fall of Bethel Fortress has frightened the defenders of Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liboron family tried their best, but they couldn't stop the orc army, let alone them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the weather is calm, that is because the orcs have shrunk their forces and attacked the Bethel Fortress with all their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the battle to defend Bethel Fortress started, the defenders of Flying Bear Castle were also beaten. The two legions stationed here have long been tortured by the orcs to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was hard to wait for the arrival to change defenses and rest. If you don't run quickly, you won't be able to leave when the orc army kills you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I am looking forward to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After days of fighting, we have long been exhausted, lest there will be problems in the fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that you are here, we can also go back and take a break to catch up on a good night's sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Castle is here for you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson, Viscount Raquel, let's take a step first and wait until we get together after the war...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing the polite words, the middle-aged officer couldn't wait to set off with the team, not giving him a chance to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was also speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after looking at the team leaving the city, I immediately understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these guys only knew that the Bethel Fortress had fallen, and they didn't know the heavy price paid by the bear royal court. They mistakenly thought that the enemy would attack immediately, so they reacted so aggressively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to explain, Hudson is too lazy to keep him because he is in a hurry to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has just begun, and it is still fine, but I don't know when I will lie down. To make friends at such a time is to increase troubles in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the two legions leave, Hudson found that their team was much shorter than the normal legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, the main battle armies on the front line were dissatisfied, and there was only one explanation: they were lost on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can tell autumn by seeing a leaf. It is definitely not just the defenders of Flying Bear Castle who have suffered heavy losses. I am afraid that the defenders on the entire defense line have been tortured enough by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foreign garrison has left, but the Erwin family is still there. Although a patriarch died, it did not mean that the obligation was completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless he can give up inheriting the title and territory, the lord's obligation to guard the land still cannot be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the aristocratic group, Hudson is very aware of how closed this group is. Once he gives up his foundation, it is almost impossible to get it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying behind is a narrow escape, but starting a new business is a near-death. Even if you can really let go of all this, the ending will not be much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No aristocratic status, not protected by the rules of the game, they are fat sheep that have just come out of the slaughter, and anyone who sees them will kill them with a knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Voluntary renunciation is different from exiled nobles. The family lost their fief and the head of the family died in battle. If the heir wants to inherit the territory, he cannot inherit it, but he is still the legal heir in terms of law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the Principality of Moxi recovers the lost land, they can still inherit the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the choice of the Erwin family, it is also the same route as these nobles. The new Patriarch fully cooperates in defending the city, and naturally everyone is happy if he defends it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't keep it, arrange for the younger generation to leave, pay for a new head of the family and the remaining private army of the family, wait for the day when the principality recovers the lost land, and regain everything lost again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking over the power of city defense from the immature Viscount William, Hudson took a group of trusted officers and patrolled around the city. When it comes to his wealth and life, he dare not take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, the good news made Chris IX's gloomy face slightly better. If he had received such good news before the fall of the Bethel fortress, he would have definitely celebrated with a drink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it was too late. A tactical victory could not make up for a strategic mistake. The greatest significance of the \"good news\" is only to boost morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Has the record been verified? They really wiped out a Beamon cavalry regiment?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has long been the norm to use artistic methods to report the record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality needs to appease people's hearts. If it doesn't embellish it, no one can bear the battle report of losing every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is an exception. The record of annihilating a Beamon cavalry regiment is already big enough. If you pour water into it, it will look too fake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, our Military Affairs Department has verified the record many times. The Wright County Army and the newly formed 23rd Army are indeed on the way, annihilating a Beamon cavalry regiment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins replied in the affirmative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of record, that can't be more true. No matter how hard you pick, you can't find any problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The modified content on the battle report is nothing more than concealing that the Beamon Cavalry Regiment had a **** battle with the enemy before falling into their encirclement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flaws in the details are all minor problems. The process of the battle is not important, the key is that the number of behemoths captured matches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual record is the most convincing. If they come a few more times, the Beamon family will definitely not be able to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As long as there is no problem, let's promote it directly! With this good news, it will also be a big boost to the morale of the domestic army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there are no problems at all. There are no faults in the battle results and battle reports, but there is a big problem in the battle damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the data they reported, the Wright County Legion lost more than 2,800 horses, and the newly formed 23rd Legion lost 500 horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But according to what we know, the entire Wrightshire Army does not have 2,000 horses. How did they lose so many horses!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We sent people to communicate with Earl Hudson, but he insisted that the loss is so big, let us replenish him as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins said rather helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False reporting of war damage is nothing new.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of a victory, as long as there are not too many false reports, the Ministry of Military Affairs will choose to default, which is a reward for the meritorious officials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you cross the boundary, you have to send someone to check it out. Under normal circumstances, everyone abides by the tacit agreement and will not go too far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs is only approved, and the logistics department under it is responsible for the replenishment of supplies. If the people below are allowed to lie, the logistical work will be impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long time, the logistics department has also learned. Usually, based on the information you have, you will first calculate a number, and then use this as a standard. When replenishing supplies, you will slash the battle damage reported below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The newly formed 23rd Army reported a battle loss of 500 horses, and the ones that finally got it might only be 300 horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Wrightshire Army is an exception, as a guest army does not need to abide by the unspoken rules. If the Ministry of Military Affairs confirms the figures on the battle damage, the Ministry of Logistics can only pay in full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics department, which suffered a loss once, now wants to hide away when it sees Hudson. How dare it cut a knife on his supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of trouble, this unspoken rule that cannot be put on the table cannot be used as a reason for them to escape responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How much did the horses of the Wrightshire Army lose?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the news from the logistics department officials stationed in Flying Bear Fort, the fodder received by the Wright County Legion has only decreased slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on this, the number of horses they lost would not exceed two hundred, or even less than a hundred. Even with the addition of rough horses, the battle damage would not exceed 500 horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information we have collected, the Earl of Hudson is particularly keen on cavalry. In addition to a standard cavalry regiment, a large number of poor horses are also equipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the soldiers of the Wrightshire Regiment have learned to ride horses. The siege of the Beamon Cavalry Regiment this time turned infantry into cavalry. There were as many as 3,500 cavalrymen dispatched by them alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many poor horses, some of them were exchanged for weapons and equipment seized on the battlefield, and most of them were extorted from our logistics department. The poor horses they used to accompany the army were still pulling carts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As this continues, I very much doubt that the Wrightshire Regiment will become a cavalry regiment before the war is over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he likes all the troops that can fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the elite army needed more supplies, he would not blink. He has also seen a lot of all kinds of coquettish operations by the titans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is the first time he has encountered this way of changing from infantry to cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tucao belongs to Tucao, but he still didn't clearly raise objections. Although there are some discordant rules, the unstoppable strong have privileges.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"give him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX rubbed his forehead and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitated for a moment, then added: \"Tell Earl Hudson that the war horse is only a small problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can kill another 5,000 Beamon cavalry, or annihilate 10,000 other royal troops, I will have no problem changing all of him into cavalry! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Painting, naked painting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If so many elite orcs can be killed, it is estimated that there will not be many people left in the Wright County Legion. Everyone is gone, and the promised change of clothes will naturally not be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be better if there wasn't too much breakage. If you pay some equipment, you will have an extra elite cavalry regiment available, and the Principality of Moxi will not lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether Hudson can turn the elite infantry into elite cavalry, there is a case of annihilation of the Beamon Cavalry Regiment, and Chris IX is not worried at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, how do you think about the matter of awarding meritorious officials? Or do you follow the old practice and accumulate it for calculation after the war?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My son is also on the battlefield, even if he follows along with his military exploits, it is still a military exploit. As a vested interest, concern is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the eldest son's life and death uncertain, he now has to devote more energy to the second son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Raquel's personal ability is very average, but he is lucky. He got on his thigh at the beginning, and he can just lie down and win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his luck, the probability of surviving this troubled world is very high. Coupled with the fact that people are young, there is still a lot of room for plasticity. It is still possible to cultivate a spare tire as a family heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to ask for their own opinions. Adding the credits of the last time, many people's credits are enough to promote a title, or exchange for a fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they want to settle, the principality can give them settlement rewards. Titles, fiefdoms, gold, silver and jewellery, beauties, and cultivation resources are all up to them to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't plan to settle, then according to the old practice, the accumulation will be calculated after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Related explanation work, the Ministry of Military Affairs must do a good job, and there must be no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wrightshire Legion, the title cannot be promoted, so let's reward some real things!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to contact them, trying to win over as many nobles as possible. You can be more generous in the title fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially that Earl of Hudson, if we can win over and let him be stationed in the northern border area, we can also...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX's words seemed unintentional, but they were actually said deliberately for everyone to hear. The main thing is to worry that the subordinates will not work hard, after all, no one wants to divide their own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Principality of Moxi is not very attractive to the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, as long as it promises a large profit, it will always be able to lure a few fools over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being active for such a long time, I have not achieved any results. If I say that it has nothing to do with the passive sabotage of my subordinates, I am afraid no one will believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now deliberately naming and stationing in the northern Xinjiang area is the best promise to the domestic nobles. After this war, there are probably not many nobles who are willing to be neighbors with orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the past experience of the Alpha Kingdom, the Orc Empire will launch a full-scale invasion every few decades. Maybe everyone can meet for the second time in their lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The border always needs to be guarded by someone. If you don't want to go, you can only let others go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nobles of the Principality don't want the territory in the north, and it ends up in the hands of the king, the royal family can't be allowed to top the tank, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Central government directly under the jurisdiction?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention that there is no such precedent, the problem is that everyone is worried! Judge others by yourself, no matter what kind of person you are, most other people are not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rapid fall of the Augustsburg defense line, although everyone didn't say it, they knew it very well in their hearts, and it was absolutely inseparable from the bureaucrats who presided over the construction of the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No accountability was carried out because the guys who were in charge of building the defense line back then are now buried in the ground. The last unlucky guy fell on the battlefield together with the line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This cannot be solved by substitutions. The aristocratic lords built the castle themselves, and once they found a problem, they said they would rework it. The cost is not worth mentioning in front of the wealth and life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But bureaucrats can't do it, no matter how clean they are, it's useless. After all, the budget has a limit, and it cannot be reworked at will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a problem is discovered, for the sake of his own position, he will choose to cover it up. Anyway, as long as the orcs don't make a full-scale invasion during their tenure, Ray won't explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Have suffered a loss once, and paid the blood price for it, no one wants to come again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will definitely work hard to complete it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
