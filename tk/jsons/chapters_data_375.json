This time, we have paid a full 40% more for the repayment tax distribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter did not go through the provincial noble council, it was done by the governor alone. As long as the Earl is willing to take the lead, we will definitely be able to veto this illegal resolution in the meeting!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    contributed to this matter, the Earl is our benefactor, the next governor...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the old man's saliva flying performance, Hudson silently released the magic shield for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even fools have to make drafts!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, there is no problem in vetoing the governor's resolution in the provincial aristocratic council. But the key to the problem this time is not only Governor Pierce, but also the high-level meeting in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the meeting at the time, it was only a symbolic opposition. How could Hudson make trouble at this time and openly overturn the decision made at the King Capital meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes someone who doesn't follow the rules. If you really do something like this that breaks the political rules, not to mention competing for the next governor, I'm afraid it will be difficult to gain a firm foothold in the circle of big aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not worthwhile to bet your political life for the benefit of a group of fools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Leslie, it's a done deal now, and it's too late to say these things. Of the fifteen county guards in the province, I am the only one who publicly opposes it, and it can't reverse the situation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are dissatisfied with the repayment tax share, you can appeal to the county sheriff's office, the governor's office, or the provincial noble council to initiate impeachment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said perfunctorily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the appeal is useful, there is no need for everyone to gather here. As a large tax-paying province, it is not surprising that the Southeast Province bears a high proportion, but there must be a limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the \"repayment tax\" apportioned by the southeastern provinces should not exceed 10%, but this time it was increased to 14%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, if more money and food were paid on the basis of the normal ratio, they would be compensated in other ways, but this time there was not even a hair of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the extra apportionment, the big nobles paid a lot, but this \"big head\" is also relative to the total number. If you take it apart and take a closer look, you will find that the reality is completely opposite to the theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the traditional tax package model, taxes are collected from top to bottom. The governor and local county guards are the specific executors, and the small nobles who lack enough voice will definitely bear the heaviest taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most fundamental reason why everyone went to the Mountain Territory was that they didn't want to spend more money, and they didn't dare to openly challenge the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, we want to initiate impeachment, but we lack a prestigious leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you will take the lead, we will be able to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the aged Baron Leslie perform hard, Hudson shook his head secretly. The typical thinking of the little nobles has not yet seen the situation clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's approach can serve multiple purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling the interests of the minor nobles at this moment not only wins over a few middle-level nobles in the province, and gains an advantage in the competition with the Koslow family; it also lays the foundation for their own expansion in the next few decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the rule system, if the minor nobles do not fall, how can everyone expand their fiefs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge territory now owned by the Dalton family did not fall from the sky, nor was it conferred by the king all at once, but was acquired through countless land mergers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, if Hudson takes the lead publicly, he will offend not only the Dalton family, but also a group of middle-level nobles in the province, as well as some powerful and ambitious minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it is also profitable for the Dalton family to play like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prodigal family of the nobles is not completed in a day or two, but a long-term process. During this period, in order to fill the gap, it is necessary to stage various show operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect to get many treasures, it is always no problem to take the opportunity to buy some serfs to supplement the population of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you can also recruit some talents. Annexing other people's foundations is an endless life-and-death enmity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you guide it, it is completely reasonable for these losers to defect to him, the hostile force of the Dalton family, for revenge and to revive the family business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earth is dead, but man is alive. If you can't move the fief, can you still move the people in the fief?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the calculation in his mind, Hudson wouldn't be too lazy to talk nonsense with this group of people here. I really thought that the threshold of his Earl's Mansion was low, and anyone could come in!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Leslie, that's it for today. I've been exhausted all the way, and now I'm going to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson, arrange a banquet tonight to entertain all distinguished guests! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson turned and left directly. Such a shameless approach made Baron Leslie lose his temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today I came here to beg for help, not to offend anyone. It doesn't matter if the big nobles are arrogant and self-willed, but the small nobles have to be ignorant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson did not finish the job after all. Although he left, he left Nelson to take charge of the reception. The earl's elder brother came forward to receive them, and the etiquette was absolutely impeccable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Backing back to the inner courtyard, Hudson immediately greeted Melissa with a smile on her belly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took three months to leave, and there were few letters in the middle. If it was in the previous life, there would have been a quarrel, but now the courtyard is extremely harmonious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could speak, Hudson was confused. A person who shouldn't have appeared here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the talking and laughing Melissa and Isabel, he always felt that the style of painting was not right. When a wife and a lover bump into each other, it is a proper Shura field, and it is considered self-restraint not to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How is it, this trip to the capital is going well?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa's words pulled Hudson back from his surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Had a little trouble, but generally went well. What are you two?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he asked the question, Hudson secretly scolded himself for being stupid. Just pretend you don't know anything, how can you bring up this topic?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't it all because of your good deeds? Now I'm taking care of the aftermath for you, and I'm not happy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa rolled her eyes and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, she is still very satisfied with her current life. Hudson's integrity is much higher than she expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the lover Isabel, it seems that there is nothing wrong with it. But for a young nobleman, this is not a problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She had already prepared everything, but when Hudson came back from his trip to the capital this time, he was preparing for another group of Yingying Yanyans in the mansion, but nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Happy, how can I not be happy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hastily responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stir it together, just stir it together. Isabel is not a fuel-efficient lamp, and Melissa is not a fool for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to grasping people's hearts, especially men's hearts, Isabel is definitely better; but if it is really a game of tricks, I am afraid that the three of her combined will not be Melissa's opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic education is not just knowledge and etiquette in books, but more practical means, which also includes the battle in the back house. The greater the noble, the stricter the education in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Political marriage\" is a marriage between two surnames. If there is no means, how can we ensure that the marriage can play a substantive role?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on coaxing and deceiving, Hudson finally figured out the ins and outs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While he was away, Isabel took the initiative to find Melissa and promised her that she would not have a child for Hudson within ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This promise is almost equal to nothing. Isabel, who pursues strength, has no intention of having children at all now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The golden period of knight training is only a few decades. If you want to go to a higher level to see the scenery, you can't waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, she is a lover, not a mistress, so there is no pressure on childbearing. Even if you don't have children in your life, no one will take it for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of being frightened every day, it is better to go to the door to show your cards and show that you are not a threat. Save yourself from being killed by someone one day, and you don't know how you died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel is not an uninformed master, she would not foolishly think that with the protection of Hudson, she would really sit back and relax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the hostess, Melissa has a lot of resources at her disposal. If you really want to kill her, there are ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson doesn't know if there are other stories behind this, and he doesn't want to know. As long as the result is good, the process is often not that important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I had a drink at noon and slept until midnight. I hurriedly coded a chapter, cut it down, and there was only so little left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will send it first, and if it is not enough, I will make up later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 352": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 352: king's death\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 352 The King's Death\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Finally succeeded!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disgraced Hudson couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After countless failures, he finally completed the transformation of the Xiong Xiong brand feed pills, and made a pill suitable for both animals and animals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the final result, Hudson was speechless after feeling overwhelmed. The growth-promoting pills, which I thought were profound and mysterious, were actually presented in the simplest way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any complex craft is superfluous. The effect of the pill itself on promoting the growth of the monsters is negligible. What can really promote the growth of the monsters is the energy extracted from the magic core and magic crystal by the mysterious compass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The existence of the pill is to carry these energies, so that the energy can be released slowly after entering the body of the monster, so as to avoid indigestion from rushing into it all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the specific effect? ​​Because the experimental model is too rare, Hudson is temporarily unable to draw a conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the dose-reduced pills, used to feed pigs and sheep, have exerted remarkable effects, growing at a speed visible to the naked eye every day, and it is estimated that they will be ready for slaughter in three to four months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cost is not considered, it is definitely the most suitable feed for farming with this stuff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure natural, no additives, also promotes the evolution of pigs and sheep. If you're lucky, you might be able to achieve bloodline return to your ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The large tusks grown by the experimental pigs are the best evidence. The meat quality is better than that of domestic pigs, and its physical fitness is no worse than that of wild boars, especially its ability to turn circles is super strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stepping out of the laboratory, the refreshed Hudson immediately ordered to the guards: \"Send the order, and the selection of Warcraft cubs will begin on the 3rd of next month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family children aged 13 to 30 and generals above centurions in the army can participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules consist of two points: being able to recognize the cubs of Warcraft; having sufficient contributions to the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who don't make enough contributions are allowed to owe it in advance, and deduct it from the future credits. The specific standard rules will be announced later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the recent period, the mother beasts have not been idle either. The number of cubs who gave birth to cubs and those who laid eggs laid eggs. The number of magical beast cubs in the territory has increased dramatically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to fulfilling the promised cubs, the number of cubs left in the territory also exceeded thirty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, the smaller the monster is to cultivate, the easier it is to become dependent on the master, and the closer the cooperation will be in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like the relationship between Hudson and Bear Stearns, it is closer than that with Maxim. The former followed him not long after he was born, and his limited life was basically by his side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the normal contractual relationship, Hudson also worked part-time as a baby daddy and has been taking care of the bear cub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim is different. Although there are gaps in the inheritance, it is easy to fool around, but after all, he is an adult dragon over 300 years old, and the contact with Hudson is just the blink of an eye in his dragon life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Warcraft Legion, Hudson's choice is very simple. The air force uses the descendants of griffins and dragons - Griffin Dragon, and the army cavalry uses the descendants of large lizards and dragons - ground dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, the main reason is that the number of these two kinds of Warcraft cubs is the largest, and they have the conditions to form an army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson prefers to use the descendants of wyverns and giant dragons as the air force, and the descendants of the armored dragon with big thorns as the army cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cubs behaved differently when they were just born. According to the judgment of the Mage Association, these little guys have the potential to be cultivated into high-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the number of females of these two kinds of monsters is too small. There are still a pair of wyverns, and only one armored dragon. The number of female beasts is scarce, and the output cannot be expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the cubs came out, they sent people to discuss compensation issues with Hudson to provide these powerful forces of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of female beasts is too small, and it is impossible to reach the rake base. According to the previous agreement, either keep a cub or make financial compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is expected to grow into a cub of a high-level magical beast (level seven, eight or nine), and it also has certain strategic significance to the big forces. No one will give it up easily, so the only way to do it is to give money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were more than one similar incidents. When the mother beast level reached the intermediate level (level 4, 5, 6), the cubs born were taken away by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the high-level female beast, Hudson has never seen it. It is estimated that everyone knows it well, knowing that these magical beasts with high IQ are not easy to fool, and it is useless to want them to be breeding beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And the higher the level of the monster, the stronger its own blood, and it is not so easy to be assimilated by the dragon gene. Hybrids born from crossbreeding tend to be polarized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the sudden blood pulse, the cub either succeeds in mutation and advances in talent; or fails in mutation and becomes waste directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mutation is a small probability event after all, and the probability of the latter is significantly greater. Perhaps due to the instinct of reproduction and inheritance of race, high-level monsters reject interracial love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, except for Zha Long. The giant dragon in estrus always only cares about its own comfort, and the problems of its offspring are not considered at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can take it seriously. It doesn't matter if the cubs of low-level monsters are left behind. They are all equipped for subordinates, and they are not his own mounts. There is no need to set such a high standard, as long as there are enough cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These magical beast cubs have the blood of a giant dragon. If they are trained well, they also have the hope of advancing all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the Arcanists, if the Yalong beast wants to break through the restriction of racial talent and advance to a higher level, it needs to purify the blood of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to theoretical research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In real life, Yalong beasts living in the wild do have the lucky ones who break through the limitations of racial talent; but Yalong beasts raised in captivity do not lower their own ranks, which is considered good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the successful development of a medicine for purifying blood can change this situation. But these are all things in the future. Hudson has not heard of anyone who has made this potion yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, after a period of running-in, the Crown Prince Caesar gradually became familiar with the government affairs of the court and China, and finally had a bit of a monarchy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perseveringly, with the king's long-term absence, the undercurrent swept along. Not only the domestic nobles are restless, but even the big forces abroad are ready to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the major powers in the Northern Continent temporarily huddled together because of the Warcraft Legion plan, and they were not afraid of some disturbances from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of alliance is time-sensitive after all. The dragon's estrus could not last, and once the mating was done, the common interest ceased to exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally agreed that everyone would jointly develop a growth-promoting drug, but now it has become a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the trend of selfishness, the major forces involved in research and development all have their own little calculations, and even the daily exchange of results has great reservations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that the progress of joint research and development is comparable to a snail, but everyone's individual research and development work is progressing well. All have improved on the original formula, and the specific effect will not be known until it is used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all a bunch of jerks!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar cursed fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    International disputes are nothing, everyone is still in the tentative stage, and the storm will not affect the Alpha Kingdom for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is different in China. The messages from all over the place all explained the restlessness of the nobles from all over the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the \"repayment tax\" was established, the burden on the minor nobles has been increasing. Layers of money were allocated all the way, and many small nobles who were already in a difficult situation were already struggling to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This year is only the first year, and the repayment tax amount formulated is not large. At most, it can only be regarded as an appetizer for testing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By next year, when this number expands further, the real crisis will begin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the tax bill is inflated all the way, but it is actually a way for the big nobles to constantly test the bottom line of the small nobles, wanting to play with boiling frogs in warm water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it, but the kingdom has no way to stop it. Once the repayment tax is stopped, the kingdom's finances will simply not be able to bear the huge debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, the real way to solve the problem is to reduce part of the debt principal every year and keep reducing interest expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that this process is too painful. During the debt repayment cycle, the small nobles in the country did not have a good life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The tax crisis broke out in the southeastern province. The minor nobles who were on the verge of bankruptcy surrounded the governor's mansion and asked the kingdom to reduce or exempt taxes. What do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar suppressed his anger and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was obviously an action against the Dalton family, but here it became a collective tax resistance of the small nobles. There must be something wrong behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, it is inappropriate for the Kingdom to directly intervene in this matter. Send a letter directly to Governor Pierce and let him find a solution by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we don't express our position, we can stay out of the matter no matter what happens next, and finally appear as an arbitrator. If it's mixed in, it's hard to tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the southeastern province is making a big fuss now, in fact, the crisis of the kingdom has never been in the southeastern province. No matter how hard the Dalton family struggled, the Earl of Hudson would still have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The threat to us is minimal until the two powers compete to decide the winner. Perhaps the current chaos is Earl Hudson's counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large group of small nobles ran to the Governor's Mansion to cry and sell miserably. It is not so easy to solve. Maybe Governor Pierce will bleed heavily this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the little nobles are resisting taxes or protesting, this hot potato is in the hands of the Dalton family. If the problem is not handled well, then Governor Pierce is incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, it didn't matter, all you needed to do was to make an example of others, and the worst thing was to be scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the situation is different now, the competitors are still watching from the sidelines, and these extraordinary measures cannot be used at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few nobles die at this moment, maybe Earl Pierce is in danger of being impeached and resigned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this key position is lost, the Dalton family's political advantage will not be so obvious in the next competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, if we let it go, will it encourage...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, the palace bell rang. An ominous premonition welled up in the heart of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, something is wrong, Your Majesty... Your Majesty...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the sound of people sobbing, everyone guessed the result—Caesar III was going to be cold, or it was already cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, although it was a few days earlier than Archbishop Tai Lun estimated, things in life and death are never controllable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of saying hello to everyone, Crown Prince Caesar had already run out of the hall and headed straight for the harem, presumably wanting to see his father off for the last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers followed closely behind. The troubles now are just the precursors of the storm, and the death of Caesar III is when the storm really comes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running all the way to the king's residence, hearing the cries of the palace servants, everyone's tears also fell down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to doubt, it must be Caesar III who passed away. Otherwise, there would not be such a big scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar, who was running ahead, opened the door and looked at the corpse on the hospital bed, and burst into heart-piercing cries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was really sad this wave. The person closest to him left just like that, and in the days to come, no one could shelter him from the wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the happy time when they were together as children, Crown Prince Caesar cried more and more sadly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, little Caesar. Now is not the time to be sad. Since His Majesty passed away, you have to take over his burden and shoulder the mission of the royal family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Tyron said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most outstanding monarch of the Alpha Kingdom just left. Before he died, he passed away in a coma without even leaving his last words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, prepare for the funeral! Since His Majesty has gone, we must let him go in a good way.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the speech, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland's tears were also rolling down, and he did not appear to be calm and calm as usual.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officials behind him also spoke in twos and threes, constantly persuading the crying Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was enough crying, or maybe everyone's persuasion played a role. Crown Prince Caesar, who was crying into tears, nodded slowly. It's just the words in my mouth, but I can't say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

You should wait!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, Redman, who was about to salivate, immediately realized his gaffe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a knight, owning a monster mount is Redman's lifelong pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, life is impermanent. The Warcraft mount he envied once upon a time is now within reach, and even has the capital to be picky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside high-level monsters, those things can be encountered but not sought after. Even if it came to his door, Redman didn't think he could control it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as the earl's father, he can still look forward to having a good-looking mid-level monster as a mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, pickiness is limited to mountain areas. If it goes to the outside world, it is still hard to find a beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Redman's strength, it's okay to take the risk to challenge a low-level monster. Wanting to train a wild mid-level monster is purely a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many gold warriors and silver warriors who die in the Warcraft Mountains every year. Even the earth knights and sky knights in the past, if they are unlucky, they can only feed the Warcraft, let alone him, a big knight who relies on resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other times, finding a low-level monster as a mount can show off in the circle of relatives and friends for many years, but the situation is different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the investment of the major forces in the breeding base, it can be seen that it is only a matter of time before Warcraft becomes the standard equipment for knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, low-level monsters will not be enough to see, and if you want to get them, you must at least have mid-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Redman has been hanging around among the small nobles, it doesn't affect him to set himself a benchmark against the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Redman asked with concern: \"Hudson, just distribute the cubs like this, can they afford it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising monsters is a costly job. Eating meat every meal is just a small problem, the key is that the ripening medicine is expensive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cheapest magic beast ripening potion on the market costs dozens of gold coins, which is not enough for a month's dose. According to this breeding mode, if all the expenses are added together, it may cost thousands of gold coins a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the cost of medicine, it is less than one-tenth of it. Usually, the refined medicine is diluted and sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be giving everyone a chance, but it is actually a means to weaken the financial resources of the little nobles. If you really plunged in recklessly, your family would definitely be hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is another tacit understanding of the great nobles. Once the little nobles set foot on this road, all future financial resources will be invested in themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for small nobles with a thriving population like the Koslow family, the cultivation of the family's children alone will exhaust all the financial resources of the territory and lose the possibility of continuing to develop the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guide the public opinion a little bit, turn this model into the mainstream, and the future little nobles will become a group of reckless men who only know how to charge forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading troops to fight does not exist, and it is unknown whether the small lord has a private army, let alone exercise command ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Future wars will become more and more irrelevant to ordinary people, and will eventually become battles between knights. The status of the great nobles remained the same, but the minor nobles changed from officers to soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more tragic is that many people can't do it if they want to be soldiers. When the mode of war changes in an all-round way, the monopoly will further intensify, and even if you have money, you will not be able to buy medicine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raised threshold will become everyone's strongest moat, blocking all competitors from the door, and continuing to continue their own power and wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing all this clearly, nothing can be changed. The emergence of this new ruling system is not promoted by a certain person or organization, but stems from the self-protection instinct of the ruling group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course I can't afford it! With everyone's current salary, there are only a handful of monsters in the territory that can afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even without the use of potions, not many people can afford the food expenses of the Warcraft cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as long as they join the army and accept recruitment permanently, the cost of raising monsters will be paid by the territory for them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to bind talents, Hudson also racked his brains. The temptation of the Warcraft mount is only one of them, and there will be more supporting means in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deliberately limit the age, in addition to considering the development potential, the most important thing is because young people are easy to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you can't resist the temptation and accept Master Hudson's Warcraft cubs, unless you have the chance to grow up to break the rules, you can only hang out with Master Hudson for the rest of your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actually, among those who currently exchanged for Warcraft cubs, only two of them contributed enough, and the rest were debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the Warcraft cubs have been distributed to the subordinates, and the ownership has been transferred, but it is essentially the arming of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the Warcraft cubs belong to individuals, everyone's care will only be more meticulous. After all, this is to go to the battlefield together. If you don't maximize the intimacy of the Warcraft mount, you are irresponsible for your own life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, it's good if you have a care in your heart. I don't have any experience to provide you with these things. Maybe some big families will have records. You can read more books when you have nothing to do.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Redman said disappointedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talents are middle-aged, far from the age of retirement. But because of his limited ability and vision, he had to retire early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced by reality. With his status, as long as he comes out to do things, he is doomed to have a low status. If you continue to be active outside, it will be easy for people to take advantage of you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to speak to comfort him, the guards who rushed over interrupted the conversation between father and son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, something is wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, the magic circle of communication in Beida City was activated, and an urgent message came from the capital, Your Majesty... Your Majesty collapsed! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson was dumbfounded. Although he knew that Caesar III was in poor health, he was still able to come out to preside over the meeting when we met four months ago, but now he is gone all of a sudden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After regaining his senses, Hudson immediately realized that there was a big problem. He didn't think anyone would dare to make a joke of such a matter involving the safety of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it makes me drunk. The communication magic circles set up in various provinces have never been activated. The first time Hudson saw it used, it was actually to inform the king that it was gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But I have to admit that this is the most efficient means of communication. From now on, it is estimated that almost all the major forces in the entire Aslant continent have received this news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous death of Chris IX, the Principality of Moxi is at the moment of life and death, regardless of etiquette or etiquette.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is a time of peace, and the dead Caesar III is still the most outstanding monarch in the kingdom, so it is necessary to do a good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the movement, you can tell that not only they, the nobles of the kingdom, are going to the funeral, it is estimated that all countries in the mainland will send people to go there, and maybe there will be representatives of other races on the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed on. From now on, any banquets are prohibited in the territory, and all wedding banquets of noble children will be postponed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how the situation develops next, the rules still have to be followed. Jurisprudentially, Caesar III was his lord. As a younger brother, how can you celebrate the death of your boss?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already begun to secretly calculate the follow-up impact of the death of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Northland, after receiving the news of the death of Caesar III, the five dukes gathered together for the first time. Even the younger brothers who followed them also came over to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sadness does not exist. The boulder that was pressing on them was finally removed. Without Caesar III, the hero, to take the lead, there is a high probability that the suppression of them by all parties will slow down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not too early to be happy. Although His Majesty went to meet the Lord of Dawn, our reputation in the noble circle is still very bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a big move is made, they are likely to temporarily abandon the contradiction and clean us up first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez's pouring of cold water directly extinguished everyone's enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from other countries, the main conflict among the great nobles of the Alpha Kingdom is not that acute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to previous struggles, if it is necessary to divide the camps, it will be the northern nobility and the southern nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The definition of \"Southern Xinjiang nobles\" is somewhat broad, and other nobles other than the northern nobles are included.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, their ancestors are so awesome. In the process of rising, all the forces in the kingdom have been offended over and over again, and the difference is limited to the severity of the offense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, everyone needed them to guard the gate. I don't care about them if there are some conflicts of interest. Now that I have lost the qualification to watch the gate, it is time to pay off the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this main line of conflict, there is now an additional group of emerging nobles, who are jointly hostile by the old nobles. But this is just the instinct of the vested interest groups to protect the food, far from the point of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Together with the Dalton family and the Koslow family in the southeastern province, the two sides only played games within the scope of the rules, and did not tear their faces openly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, let the Koslow family choose an enemy. The number one is the feuding Locknard family, not the Dalton family, which has a conflict of interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one came out to spread hatred, and the \"nobles of southern Xinjiang\" would fall into internal strife because of their interests. If they're too active, that's another story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rodriguez, the matter is not that serious. Don't forget that the situation is different now. We are on the line with His Royal Highness, or the future Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the leadership of the royal family, the gang of nobles in southern Xinjiang would be in disarray. What's more, after the new king succeeds to the throne, what he needs most is stability. Whoever provokes disputes first will be the enemy of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, they mocked us for being ugly. Now it's their turn, and they probably won't be able to see where they are eating!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think that the nobles in southern Xinjiang are all modest and gentlemen. This kind of expansion opportunity, which has been rare for decades, is just given up in vain! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the five major families in the Northland have no room for expansion, and the original territory has long been wiped out by them. Even if it wasn't their own territory, it was their younger brother's territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to engage in mergers again, you can only extend your tentacles to the outside world. Either reach out to the central provinces of the kingdom, or target the newly recovered seven provinces of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that neither of these is a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the central part of the kingdom are not easy to bully. If they dare to stretch out their hands, they will be cut off by them. Unless there is a large-scale civil war, there is no hope in sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom has newly recovered the seven major provinces. The nobles inside are indeed soft persimmons, but the forces behind these people are not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides them, all the big forces in the kingdom took a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is that after losing the suppression of Caesar III, everyone can't bear the desire to expand. Except for the group of emerging nobles who were busy digesting the fruit and had no spare time to participate, all the old nobles were sharpening their swords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is indeed different, but there is one problem we must consider, that is, once the large-scale merger is fully started, it will be difficult to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one Caesar III. Without the suppression of a powerful monarch, the strength of the local nobles will only expand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their strength continues to grow, but we are standing still. In the future, the gap in strength between everyone will only become smaller and smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, since the end of the war, we have been going downhill. Especially after losing the kingdom's financial subsidies, the days of our family are even more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know about your situation. Anyway, the Lochnard family had a serious financial deficit last year, and this situation will continue this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce expenses, we have to reduce military expenditures and greatly reduce the number of standing troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If things go on like this, within ten years our military advantage will cease to exist; within twenty years, we will fall to the middle and lower reaches of the great aristocracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Locknard family is like this, I guess your family is not much better. Compared with the succession of kingship, what we need to solve is the financial problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Torsten raised a more serious question, drawing everyone's attention back to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now relying on their capital, they are still the only one among the nobles in the kingdom. But this advantage is constantly being consumed over time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Financial deficit is the biggest flaw of several of them now. I can't go on the road of militarism, and I can't support my family if I farm honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to get money has become a serious problem right now. In the past, it was possible to make up for its own financial deficit by smuggling and capturing slaves to the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no need to hope. The orc empire has been forced to a poor land, and there is a human kingdom in the middle. Even if they want to resume their old business, there is no condition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only can conventional means fail to solve their financial problems, even if the \"Criminal Law\" of the Alpha Kingdom is broken, they still can't find a way to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thorsten, don't fantasize. The northern border is not as rich as the south. Competing with them for financial resources is purely self-defeating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our advantage is that we are under the threat of war all the year round, the people in the Northland have always been tough, and the army formed is more effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the kingdom has already started to engage in Warcraft Legion, and the future war mode is developing in a direction that we least want to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take advantage of the strength in your hands to do something now, even if you want to do it in the future, you won't be able to do it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Families have their ups and downs, no wonder. But our situation is different. Our ancestors left us too many enemies. Once we fall into a period of decline, it will be our end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of sitting still and watching the family be wiped out decades later, it is better to take a gamble, wait for the opportunity to overturn the chessboard, and start over again! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That devouring gaze seemed to swallow the whole world. In an instant, the room became quiet, and everyone was lost in thought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hiro, the dominance is no longer in our hands. Although Caesar III has gone, he will definitely leave behind the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to overturn this chessboard, at least I can't find a suitable entry point. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he is also very dissatisfied with the current situation. I want to find an opportunity to break the current political situation and find a way out for my family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rodriguez, you are too cautious. If there is no opportunity, then find a way to create an opportunity!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the speech, Duke Hiero hinted with his eyes that all the younger brothers who participated in the meeting left the venue one after another, leaving only the five Dukes to continue the discussion inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it wasn't for the fear of spreading the news, Pius VII would have prepared a celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past days, Caesar III did not slap him in the face less. However, the Alpha Kingdom is not weak and the distance is far away, so it is not easy to start a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the greatest heresy has finally fallen. Ulise, who used to be a man with his tail between his legs, suddenly became stiff again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, no one complained that their \"sacred hand\" was ineffective. The credit for assassinating Caesar III was completely given to Ulisse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Caesar III is dead, so should we start our next plan?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulise asked vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing Caesar III was just the beginning. The real purpose of the Holy See is to stir up civil strife in the Alpha Kingdom and pull out the biggest \"heretic\" in the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do not worry!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old friend, Caesar III is now dead, we have to send someone over to express condolences, so as not to spread the word and make everyone think: My Holy See is not polite. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Pius VII finished speaking, everyone burst into laughter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They said it was condolences, but in fact they went to see and add to the chaos. Referring to history, we know that the succession of royal power is rarely peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See gets involved again, the Alpha Kingdom, which is already undercurrent, will definitely become more lively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the civil war in the Warhammer Kingdom has lasted for almost a year, and it has disturbed the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the peace of the continent, I suggest helping them to unify the Warhammer Kingdom as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II is the orthodox monarch of the Warhammer Kingdom, and a devout follower of the Lord of Dawn. Supporting him in taking power in the Warhammer Kingdom is what everyone expects! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake suggested cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experiencing a series of social beatings, the leader of the Judgment Knights who barely kept his position has become more mature in his political skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the Holy See supports the nobles in the southwest region and can benefit the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, although their leaders have high prestige, they do not have the right to inherit the throne themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you use the canonization of the king as a bargaining chip and take the opportunity to offer conditions in exchange, you will definitely be able to win the greatest benefits for the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, behind the huge benefits, the backlash is also very serious. Regardless of the origin of the civil war in the Warhammer Kingdom, this kind of \"rebellion\" is not allowed to the monarchs of the mainland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the current responses of various countries, we can see one or two. At this moment, everyone supports Joseph II, the orthodox monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that all support is verbal; actual actions are always in preparation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See is willing to help Joseph II, it will be a timely help. Although there are not as many benefits as supporting the \"rebels\", the victory lies in political correctness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the countries on the mainland are conflicted in their hearts, they cannot prevent the Holy See from supporting \"orthodoxy\" on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the opportunity can be taken to complete the penetration of the Warhammer Kingdom, the layout of the Holy See in the northern continent will be completed by one-third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We really need to hurry up on this matter. The Warhammer Kingdom is already seriously damaged. If the civil war continues, they will really be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in terms of actions, it is still necessary to keep it strictly confidential and not expose us. Otherwise, it is very likely to trigger a round of proxy wars! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as half a year ago, the Holy See planned to intervene in the civil war of the Warhammer Kingdom, but out of fear of Caesar III, it was too late to extend its tentacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Although the Holy See is powerful, it is too far away from the Warhammer Kingdom after all, and the power that can be put into the past is limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy is targeting you, it will be another action to lose troops and destroy generals if you make targeted layouts in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, to intervene in the Warhammer Kingdom's civil war, we still need a major event to attract the attention of the outside world and cover for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death of Caesar III was an opportunity, but this influence was only short-term and would subside soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change of kingship in the Alpha Kingdom is a typical succession of father and son, and the domestic nobles will not object to the succession of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to have an impact for a long time, it is best to have a big event that affects the interests of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have, the total debt of the Principality of Moxi far exceeds its own carrying capacity, and even the money for cashing interest on funds is completed by issuing new debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past six months, the great nobles holding the bonds of the Principality of Moxi have been secretly reducing their holdings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a large number of war bonds have been traded again and again, they have now flowed into the hands of many small nobles and small businessmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this news gets out, it is bound to cause an avalanche in the bond prices of the Principality of Moxi. If we take the opportunity to hold a large amount of bonds and ask the Moxi people to pay in advance, this hidden mine will explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The debt of the Moxi Principality collapsed, and the Alpha Kingdom is bound to be affected. If we take advantage of the opportunity to add insult to injury, they may also default on their debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two main countries in the Northern Continent are deeply in debt. Even if our actions in the Warhammer Kingdom were exposed, they would not care about interfering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other forces on the mainland, when they take action, it is estimated that our Warhammer Kingdom's action will also be over! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cardinal Sauron's proposal immediately attracted everyone's attention. What seems to be just a large-scale debt default is actually a huge thunder that triggers the civil war of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a total of three major countries in the Northern Continent. Now that the Warhammer Kingdom is in a civil war, the Principality of Moxie and the Kingdom of Alpha have followed suit, and the regional balance within the human world has been broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, after the counterattack against the orcs ended, several powerful countries in the central part of the continent were a little impatient and wanted to expand to the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in taking action is due to the restraint of several powerful countries in the southern continent on the one hand; and the lack of moral reasons to do it on the other hand. l\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the fact that the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Alpha still retained some strength after the war, Caesar III worked out the plan of the Warcraft Legion and united all the small countries in the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although overall it is not as powerful as the kingdoms in the middle, they will not be able to swallow it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things are different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Caesar III, the leading brother, the loose alliance of major forces in the Northern Continent has reached the brink of collapse. Perhaps all it takes is a gust of wind, and it will fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the moral barriers will disappear after the outbreak of debt default.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can march to the North Continent under the banner of armed debt collection. The small nobles and small businessmen who were reduced to the last panxia in our country will become staunch main fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See waits for an opportunity to come up with something to help them hold back several powerful countries in the southern continent, then no one can stop the outbreak of civil war among the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to ignite this mine, but the trouble is how to maximize the interests of the Holy See. The Alpha Kingdom cannot be brought down, and one or more anti-Holy See countries will appear again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To restore the glory of the Holy See, the best choice is to break the current balance within the human race. But the alien races are staring at each other, and the overall strength of the entire human race cannot be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Constantly weighing the pros and cons, Pius VII lingered in the hall for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, there were similar discussions in the Kingdom of Franks, the Kingdom of Iberia, and the King of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone has different ambitions and strategic goals, and they all have different tendencies when making decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even alien races that had nothing to do with the Alpha Kingdom had a heated discussion about the death of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a moment, the entire continent of Aslant presented a scene of rain and wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally belonged to the secret \"Ten Thousand Years of Calamity\", it was also promoted by people with good intentions, and it was spread uproariously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum up, it can be summed up in one sentence: \"Ten Thousand Years Calamity\" broke out - \"racial hegemony\" replacement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, Hudson got busy after hastily ending the activity of recognizing the owner of the Warcraft cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's sudden death forced him to make major revisions to his previous territorial development plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wharf and shipyard have completed preliminary exploration, and they are waiting for the opening of the canal to start construction immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too embarrassing to give up something that you have spent a lot of money to buy. Hudson is not yet so proud that he can spend decades of investing in gold coins in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, compared with the investment of money, the \"key\" to the sea is the most valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that this was Caesar III's plan, he could only jump into the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you let go now, it may be difficult to encounter such a good opportunity in the next decade or even decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Hudson has a bunch of relevant materials in the warehouse, but no one in his hands can transform the things recorded on paper into reality, and the materials are just a pile of waste paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you like it or not, for a long time to come, the mountain territories will be tied to the royal chariot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Majesty has passed away, and the situation in the kingdom has taken a turn for the worse. You all speak out your thoughts!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, think tanks must be used. Compared with him who has been a man in two lifetimes, these native people have a way of looking at problems that is closer to the mainstream of society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, it is better to be quiet than to move at this time. The news of His Majesty's death has spread, and the kingdom is currently in an undercurrent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our intelligence collection work is seriously lagging behind. We don't know the situation in the capital and the positions of the great nobles in the country. If we intervene rashly, we will only put ourselves in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to stay still and wait for the development of the situation. After the political situation is clear, decide on the next step! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane's words disappointed Hudson very much. It seems that they are old-fashioned and seeking the country, but in fact they are missing a good opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a rising noble, it is doomed not to have the confidence of an established noble to sit firmly on Diaoyutai. At such a sensitive moment as the change of kingship, Hudson can't escape if he wants to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this turmoil is not only limited to the country, but may also involve some major international forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at everyone, Hudson turned his attention to the financial officer who was eager to try, and said directly: \"Rudolph, tell me what you think!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, the current situation is not good! The time of His Majesty's death is too sensitive, and there is a possibility that something serious will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in our southeastern province, the issue of repayment tax has become a hot topic. A large number of small nobles gathered in the Governor's Mansion to cry for poverty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it was very difficult to collect all the taxes. Now that His Majesty has passed away, everyone has to be busy with the funeral. I am afraid that the issue of taxation can only be postponed further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can delay, but the kingdom's finances cannot afford it. If this fee cannot be collected, the subsequent payment of bond interest will inevitably be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in a short period of time, the Ministry of Finance can move around and temporarily gamble on the hole, but problems will still arise later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are too many accidents that can happen during the transition of kingship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the currently determined repayment tax, it is very likely that it will be available this year, and it will not be amortized next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think that after the new king succeeds to the throne, he will be able to subdue all the nobles in the country in a short period of time and continue to accept the high repayment tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only this tax, but other taxes will also be difficult to guarantee full payment in the coming days. The kingdom's finances are likely to be dragged down by heavy debts...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Rudolph's analysis, Hudson couldn't help sighing: As expected of a financial person, the perspective of analyzing problems is just different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the political changes, the financial crisis is the most urgent problem that the Alpha Kingdom needs to solve right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally according to Caesar III's plan, as long as the first \"repayment tax\" is paid in full, it will become a practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this adaptation period, the collection will be carried out later, and everyone's resistance will not be so strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone grit their teeth and live a hard life for a few years, the Alpha Kingdom will come out of the debt crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this tax is not only used to settle the interest, but also repays part of the principal in advance. The less interest the kingdom needs to pay in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan did not change quickly, and the sudden death of Caesar III broke the plan at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"repayment tax\" was interrupted before it was collected. Whether it can be implemented in the future depends entirely on the integrity of the nobles everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If such a large amount of income is missing, no matter how good the Ministry of Finance is at tearing down the east wall and filling the west wall, it will not be able to fill such a hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The analysis is good. The kingdom's financial crisis may indeed occur. However, this is not comprehensive. In addition to domestic problems, it is also affected by the international situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone hits the kingdom, it is likely to trigger a wave of runs requiring early repayment before the bond matures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The national treasury has long been empty, and the Ministry of Finance has moved here and there to deal with some minor troubles, and it is simply unable to pay the bonds in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although theoretically speaking, we can reject this unreasonable request for early redemption, it is simply impossible to do so in practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People don't want interest on the funds. They have lent us money for so long, and if they don't pay them back, the reputation of the kingdom will be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A run is only for some bond holders. If credit collapses, all creditors will come collectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe even a show of armed debt collection can be staged, forcing us nobles to spend money to fill the hole! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said this, but Hudson knew very well in his heart that if armed debt collection broke out, what people wanted would not be money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom owes a lot of debts, there are also too many creditors who can't stand it. The debt apportioned to a single creditor is at most one or two million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a large-scale war is really launched, with such a little money, at most it will be an armed training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a bit late, but the votes still have to be cast. This is the driving force behind Haiyue's codewords!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you readers for your support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

However, after this anger lasted for a moment, it disappeared without a trace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, are you sure this is Maxim fighting with someone?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giant dragons, few of them are safe. Especially the five-color dragons are basically ruffians and villains, and few of them have three righteous views.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In their view of right and wrong, robbing wealth but not killing people is a gift to the robbed. If you are in a bad mood, it will be directly turned into a snack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Maxim, he knew that since he stepped out of Long Island, he was either doing something, or on the way to doing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The successive social beatings did not make Long Xue behave, and now he is fighting with others again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It must be! The unique aura of the red dragon is so obvious, there must be another red dragon running wild on our territory!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That expression seems to say: I'm the bear! Your giant dragon mount is a troublemaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go, let's see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already reached the bear's back. As for the feud between Bear Stearns and Maxim, he can only attribute it to: same-sex repulsion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But one thing is certain, raising a bear is indeed less worrying than raising a dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Bear Stearns' diet and daily life, you can see that he either eats or sleeps every day, and spends most of his time at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trouble, does not exist. Uncle Xiong is not so diligent. Probably an ancestor of the Earth Bear clan invented Dafa in a dream, and since then this race has been obsessed with the life of \"eat and sleep, wake up and eat\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That is, Bear Stearns is young and active. If it were replaced with an antique bear, it would probably be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragons are different. In addition to love to sleep, they are all big money fans. In order to make a fortune, those scumbags can do all kinds of things that have no bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the messy battlefield, Hudson snapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you came just in time. These guys actually sent such an ugly female beast over while I was in heat, and tempted me to make mistakes. They obviously didn't take this dragon seriously!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim was aggrieved, and the beaten magician and guardian knight were even more aggrieved. Obviously they didn't do anything, and they were beaten black and blue by the crazy dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst ones are still those on the ground. At this moment, they have less air intake and more air output. If Hudson was one step late, they would all have to meet the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was also stunned. Maxim began to pick on the appearance of the female beast, and there was only one explanation: his estrus period was over, and his aesthetics gradually returned to normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, it's certainly wrong for them to send you ugly beasts, but it's not entirely their fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't say what kind of beast you like, so everyone can only choose according to their own standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't believe me, ask, in their minds, are these female beasts all as beautiful as flowers...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a burst of unreasonable output, Hudson successfully calmed his own dragon. As for the poor guy who was injured, he could only say sorry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beginning when everyone was engaged in this job, he repeatedly emphasized: This is a high-risk job, and one must be extremely vigilant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar words, it is estimated that the bigwigs of all major forces have said it. Refer to the other giant dragon breeding bases on the mainland to know, in what year will a group of people not die due to accidents?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just being beaten up, is it possible to expect the dragon involved in the case to come out and apologize?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Maxim could pull his face down and apologize, they would not dare to accept it. Being remembered by a giant dragon is not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Hudson. For your sake, I won't pursue today's matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we still have to calculate the account, I have worked hard these days...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Maxim could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"As for the accounts, I'll check the data later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, quickly notify the priest to come and treat the wounded. Those who can still move, help the leader and pour the spare medicine into the wounded, so as not to kill anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After saying a few words of comfort, Hudson left the scene directly. Anyway, these people are just temporary partners, and they are not their younger brothers, so there is no need to win people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inside the lord's mansion, Maxim stretched out his paws, and said with a serious face: \"In recent days, the group of female beasts have laid eggs and cubs, a total of 5,371. Those pregnant female beasts waiting to give birth Beasts are not counted for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to our agreement, Benlong charges 150 gold coins for nutrition for each Warcraft cub. Now the total cost is 805,650 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care about fractions, you just give 810,000 gold coins! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Maxim's calculation method, Hudson almost spit out water. I have seen a lot of erasing odds, but I have not seen this kind of erasing more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Maxim, you made a mistake. The nutrition fee is for your nutrition, and only the rest will be paid to you directly in the form of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, you have spent a lot of money eating and drinking every day, which is not a small sum of money. The total expenditure is 85,650 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The list of accounts is here, you can check it to see if there are any mistakes or omissions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson threw a stack of account books over. It clearly records Maxim's daily meals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a rough glance, the impatient Red Dragon made some calculations in his heart, and after finding no problem, he said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Usually I eat these things, but I never spend money on them. It's my bad luck to follow a stingy knight like you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you have to pay half of these expenses. Erase the odds, and it will be 40,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    810,000 minus 40,000, there are still 770,000 gold coins, Hudson quickly give the money! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't complain about the typical dragon bookkeeping method. But anyone who has a bit of integrity can't say such shameless words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, don't worry. Gold coins don't have long legs. If it's yours, it's yours. If you can't get away, let's continue to check the accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, not every monster egg can be hatched successfully. According to the previous agreement, you can get the nutrition fee only if the monster cubs are successfully hatched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still eggs, which are still hatching. Therefore, the nutritional fee you can get is only for those that have successfully hatched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the directly born monster cubs, the total is 3,826. Total total cost: 573,900 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 85,650 gold coins just now are just your daily food expenses, in addition to:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past year, your Dragon Nest has been repaired seven times, and the construction and maintenance cost totaled 13,000 gold coins;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infrastructure repair fee for the territory caused by the fight, and the spiritual compensation fee for innocent people, totaled 37,000 gold coins;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compensation for medical expenses for the wounded and comfort for the dead, totaling 23,000 gold coins;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of your cruelty, a large number of female beasts died, including two female monsters. You need to pay a total of 34,000 gold coins as compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After deducting these expenses, your net income is now exactly 280,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only the income that has been cashed out so far. In the future, with the increase of Warcraft cubs, you will also have a large amount of income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Maxim, if you have no doubts about these accounts, please sign here! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson take out the list, Maxim immediately began to doubt Long Sheng, how could his expenses be so high?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, every expense has a detailed source. Just looking at it on paper, he really couldn't find anything wrong with it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, the price of your mountain collar is too high!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at the record above, a cow actually costs thirteen gold coins, a sheep costs three gold coins, and a brick costs five gold coins... This is clearly a robbery!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking he found a loophole, Maxim began to output crazily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, these are normal prices. Dear Mr. Maxim, don't forget that the beef and sheep you eat are all processed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the cost of beef and mutton, processing fees and spices are also paid. Therefore, it is normal for the price to exceed that of cattle and sheep on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bricks used to replace the dragon's nest are all selected high-grade high soil, fired by the best craftsmen using the most advanced technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you take it out and compare it, you can see that it is different from ordinary bricks. You get what you pay for, and the price of a good product will naturally be high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Maxim, if you think the current standard of living is too high, I can help you lower it a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In the future, the beef and mutton will be sent fresh without any processing; repairing the dragon's nest does not use beautiful special bricks, but directly uses mud...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, as long as you don't cause trouble or fight, your expenses will be greatly reduced. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said flicking to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The usual threat of force is useless, and Maxim, who lacks the experience of Longsheng, will naturally not be Hudson's opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon paws were printed, and Maxim, who was about to ask for money, received a thick bill again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the five characters of \"Magic crystal consumption\", the red dragon was completely stunned. All kinds of daily expenses, no matter how high the prices are, are traceable and can be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of daily practice is a mess. Maxim only knew that after following Hudson, his cultivation speed increased greatly, and how many magic crystals he had consumed. Unfortunately, this was a muddled account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, when I absorb the magic crystal in the future, I must see it with my own eyes, otherwise I will not admit it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, Bear Stearns, who was watching the fun, also jumped out and shouted, \"And mine too!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One dragon and one bear are in the same position, Hudson is not only not annoyed, but said kindly: \"No problem! Don't you worry about my work?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim doesn't know, don't you know about Bear Stearns? You can see how many magic crystals have been consumed in recent years! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed seen in the eyes. The magic crystals and magic cores sent by the Holy See and snatched on the battlefield were all turned into energy by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Part of it is used for daily needs, and part of it is stored in the mysterious compass. If Hudson was worried about storing a large amount of energy in the past, how to realize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no need to worry, there are a group of monsters to raise, and they can be directly used as refining additives. He doesn't even need to refine it himself, he just needs to pour it into a pill that can carry energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, these operations are all deceptive means. If it weren't for worrying about arousing suspicion from the outside world, he wouldn't even bother to use the pills, and just pour energy into the cub's body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the medicine he fiddled with now only increases the strength of the monster, but cannot give birth to the size of the monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are minor problems, a sentence of side effects of medicine can perfectly explain all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the potions for ripening monsters produced by everyone have more or less side effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he got the pill, everyone would only think that Hudson used a special method to extract energy from the magic crystal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to spend the money of the dragon and the bear to raise the Warcraft Legion for himself, Hudson has no pressure at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the more than 300 gold coins he got in the end, Maxim's tears of grievance fell down involuntarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, with quick eyesight and quick hands, immediately took out the porcelain bottle and took it. Dragon tears are a rare commodity, and just a few drops can be sold for hundreds of gold coins outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about Maxim, he was speechless. After a year of exhausting tossing, the wages he got in the end were not worth as much as the tears he shed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The episode ended, Hudson had to consider a practical issue. The end of Maxim's estrus period also means that the work of the Warcraft breeding base has come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once all the pregnant female animals have finished giving birth, this multinational cooperation will come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the base will not be withdrawn, but the main personnel will definitely be evacuated. The remaining representatives are only responsible for observing and waiting for the next estrus of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the time comes and everyone can make do with each other, maybe we can cooperate again. If the relationship breaks down, there is no future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit how powerful the giant dragon is. Judging from the current data, after the mothers finish giving birth one after another, the number of Yalong beast cubs born this time will probably fluctuate around 11,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number sounds very large, but after being dispersed throughout the Northern Continent, it becomes insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the most powerful Alpha Kingdom among them, the number of Yalong beast cubs that can be obtained is only more than 3,600.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Equally distributed to each province, only a hundred or so. Everbright aristocrats are not enough, not to mention the powerful mid-level aristocrats will also get a share, coupled with the needs of the standing army, there will be fewer people who can get their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to form a monster army on a large scale, you can only raise these cubs as soon as possible, and then reproduce them again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that in this regard, the mountain leads the way. According to the prior agreement, the mountain collar can allocate about 400 cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson sold off a wave in advance, otherwise, in the current situation, the mountain leader with so many cubs would soon fall into the target of public criticism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where is the ticket?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

For the child who is about to be born, now he can only say sorry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change of kingship will definitely involve a period of chaos. It seems that this trip to the capital is for funerals, but it is actually a new distribution of benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The end of the old era, the beginning of a new era. Once the emperor and the courtiers, many positions in the kingdom need to be adjusted at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including some policies in the era of Caesar III, it is possible to be brought up for re-discussion now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has no right to dominate the decision-making of the Kingdom, Hudson is still an important participant in this process, and cannot be absent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quarrels are trivial matters, and the most feared thing is to quarrel with real fire. If you look through the history books of your neighbors, you will know that there are too many cases of nobles who did not agree with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two nobles started fighting, and it was just an ordinary fight. If two groups of people called for friends and friends were gathered to fight, it would become a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the monarch lacks prestige and is unable to suppress the domestic nobles, the conflict is more likely to escalate into a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has a heavy task this time, not only to fight for his own interests, but also to maintain the stability of the kingdom as much as possible to avoid the escalation of domestic conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, is the red dragon's estrus period over?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Warcraft Breeding Base is not in his hands, the impact on the southeastern province is not small at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since all forces in the North Continent gathered in the mountainous territory, there have been many disturbances. Even Beda City, the home of the Dalton family, suffered a lot from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are still minor problems, the quarrels are all juniors, and the reason for the conflict is mostly a dispute of emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except that the mediation is a little troublesome and affects the daily security of Beida City, there is nothing wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really worries Governor Pierce is the international situation. The great aristocrats must not only have strength, but also have an international political vision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the common interests of the Warcraft Breeding Base, the short-term alliance of the major forces in the Northern Continent has come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one fuse missing, and this loose alliance will fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the existence of the alliance, it is really too difficult to deter several big countries in the central part of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many people who know this, but none of them can solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem is that the alliance is too loose, coming together based on common interests, and there is no binding force between them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that when Caesar III was alive, everyone gave him some face because of his personal prestige, and the Alpha Kingdom was barely considered the leader of the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of Caesar IV, there is no need to think about it. The prestige of the new king is not appreciated by the nobles in the country, let alone abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"it's over!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three short words, uttered from Hudson's mouth, seemed to weigh a thousand pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when wars were fought against the orc empire, the southeastern province was the rear of the kingdom. But now the situation has changed. Once the enemy has become a few kingdoms in the middle, the southeastern province has become the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are Blackstone Mountains in the middle, which can act as a strategic buffer, but as far as Hudson knows: the closest place between the two sides is a forest less than 100 kilometers wide, which is the territory of a group of magic wolves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For ordinary people, this is an insurmountable moat; but for a kingdom, as long as it is determined, it is only a matter of time before a road is torn apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation in the kingdom continues to deteriorate and the Hessians develop ambitions, the southeastern province will be in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Dalton family is more dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peacetime, Governor Pierce was able to take charge of the province's military and political power, and Hudson, a military officer, was almost completely empty, as if it were a vase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the situation changes and the southeastern province becomes a battlefield, the military and political power in the province will inevitably fall into the hands of Hudson, the military chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This cannot be blocked by personal will. When it comes to fighting with troops, no one in the entire Alpha Kingdom has more say than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about how miserable the nobles of the North were, you know how serious the consequences of a competitor being the coach are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson did a very covert job, Governor Pierce still determined that he played an important role in the case of selling military supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, according to your judgment, how long can the Northern Continent Alliance last?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce's worried question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to be wary of competitors, but the biggest danger now is the collapse of the international situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Dalton family is worried about the collapse of the situation, and the Koslow family also has the same concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom, which has been severely injured, has been unable to suppress the Hesse Kingdom, not to mention that the Alpha Kingdom's potential enemies are not only this family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the pressure of Caesar III, if the war broke out, the noble reinforcements from the nobles everywhere would not be so efficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the final outcome of the war, as long as the war breaks out, the southeast province of the battlefield will be the loser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maybe a year, maybe half a year, who knows?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, all the major forces sent back the pregnant high-level female monsters, and now all that are left are some low-level monsters. It is estimated that when the production is completed, the Warcraft breeding base will be depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency the Governor is suddenly concerned about these things. Is it because you are worried that the international situation will suddenly change after the alliance breaks down? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson with a calm face, Pierce was speechless. We all know that the international situation is going to change suddenly, but we still behave so calmly, but we really don't know whether it is confidence, or ignorance is fearless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the situation is different now. With the decline of the orc empire, the kingdom's transcendent status no longer exists, and we will inevitably be involved in the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is no longer a day or two for the major countries in the central part to spy on the northern continent. If the northern countries are united, they will naturally not dare to act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the conflicts between the major forces in the Northern Continent have been going on for a long time, and they cannot be resolved in a few words. Even with the existence of the Northern Alliance, they have not forgotten to flirt with the major powers in the central region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the situation deteriorates, those fools will be unreliable at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only three companies with some strength in the Northern Continent. Now the Civil War in the Warhammer Kingdom and the decline of the Principality of Moxi are severe, and even our vitality is seriously injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdoms in the central part of the mainland want to go north, now is the best opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His Majesty has just passed away. According to mainland practice, one year is not allowed to start a war without authorization. This is the kingdom's last safe period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, for my southeastern province, the extra one-year buffer period is the beginning of disaster! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce's words startled Hudson. If the Kingdom of Hesse really wants to invade the Kingdom of Alpha, one of the ways is to start a war from the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With an extra one-year buffer period, they just opened up the land transportation line between the two places. The distance of a mere 100 kilometers, as long as you are willing to spend your money and clear a road, it will not be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't worry too much. The Kingdom of Hesse really wants to open up a channel with us, and there were no shortage of opportunities in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the kingdom is unable to go south, so they don't need a buffer. During the orc invasion, just do it directly, and the kingdom can't stop it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action has been taken for hundreds of years, either their monarchs have no ambitions, or there is something in the Black Rock Mountains that makes them afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family has a profound heritage, and there is no shortage of information about the Blackstone Mountains. May I ask Your Excellency the Governor, is there anything in this that can make a kingdom afraid? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous development of the swamp, the Koslow family has reached the foot of the Blackstone Mountains. Now that he is a neighbor, Hudson naturally needs to care about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It should be a monster!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Blackstone Mountain Range is not as vast as the Warcraft Mountain Range, it covers an area of ​​700,000 to 800,000 square kilometers, and there are many high-level monsters entrenched in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these guys join forces, even if the kingdom is at its peak, it will have to be afraid of three points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, most of these high-level monsters like to be alone. Even if they are of the same kind, they will gather together when they mate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said insincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the smile on the corner of his mouth, it can be seen that he is in a good mood at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they didn't find a way to deal with the deterioration of the international situation, they accidentally discovered another major shortcoming of the Koslow family—close to the Blackstone Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the map alone, this seems to be more like an advantage. As long as the entrance to the Salam Mountains is locked, the safety of the mountain territory will be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Blackstone Mountains bordering the Koslow family is not the kind of narrow area that can enter the Kingdom of Hesse with only a hundred kilometers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in the continent of Aslant, there is also a special situation for them—beast tide!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be naturally formed, and it can also be man-made. For example: Kidnapping or hunting the cubs of a high-level monster may trigger a beast tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of immoral thing can only be planned when you are sure that you are in absolute safety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the kingdom like this is unstable now, and the kingdoms in the middle are eyeing the Northern Continent with covetous eyes, so it is absolutely impossible to play like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short conversation, the two people who were originally tense were suddenly drawn closer. Together with the two noble camps that are in a state of confrontation, there are signs of breaking the ice at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, everyone has realized that if you want to survive in a complex international environment, you must stick together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within the province, everyone is still a competitor. But when it comes to international disputes, the two sides have become allies on the same boat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, Crown Prince Caesar, who was preparing to be crowned as the throne, could not find a smile on his face at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the death of Caesar III, the major forces of the human race were still very face-saving, and they sent heavyweights to attend the funeral.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these guys are restless. They are still halfway, and they start to connect one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the big countries in the central part of the continent, they are extremely active, constantly strengthening their penetration into the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the message accurate?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar asked frowningly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is really amazing. The counties of Glint, Nadal, and Korubia in the northern continent have successively accepted the cooperation of the three major kingdoms in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the three great uncles want to be fools, they really can't help themselves. Although it is a country in the northern continent, it is adjacent to the sphere of influence of the three major kingdoms in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the overall strength of the central countries was much stronger than that of the northern countries. It was only because of the hind legs of several big countries in the south that the regional balance was achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still those who are holding back, but the Northern Alliance, which can prevent them from going north, has reached the point of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the three countries of Grint, Nadal, and Colombia can be won over, then more folly will fall over in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others can defect, but the Alpha Kingdom cannot. Even if Crown Prince Caesar was willing to be his younger brother in the past, the other party would not dare to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, we have confirmed this matter many times. The Counties of Grint, Nadal and Korubia have indeed betrayed the alliance now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news was kept strictly confidential, because they were worried that there would be too much movement, which would attract interference from countries in the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already approached many southern kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Franks and the Kingdom of Iberia, and they have expressed that they will take tough measures to maintain peace on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the intelligence gathered from various sources, the situation in the Southern Continent is quite tense, and the help they can provide us may be limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, His Highness does not need to worry too much. Although the ambitions of several big countries in the central region are great, they dare not start a war at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current actions are mainly based on temptation. The judgment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: They want to continuously win over the countries of the Northern Continent and isolate us politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind this seems to be the support of the Holy See, the acquiescence of the Franks, and even the handwriting of the Kingdom of Iberia...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis replied with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy shoots at them, that's all. However, the allies also acquiesced to the three kingdoms in the middle of the country to play against them at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to accept it in my heart, but I have to accept the reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stems from interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continent is raging with war, but the internal structure of the human race has remained stable for decades without major changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of powerful careerists, the existing mainland order is too restrictive for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See wants to break the current continental pattern and restore its former glory. As the most powerful country on the mainland, the Frankish Kingdom, why doesn't it want to go one step further?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to be the first bird, you can only encourage others to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the three kingdoms in the middle of the country are not naive, they are very clear about the current situation. It's okay to take the opportunity to get a little bit of it, but if you foolishly start a war and kill the Quartet, you will be out of your mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has their own little calculations, and then the current weird scene appeared. If you can't peel away the layers of fog, it will be difficult to distinguish between allies and enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the international situation is too chaotic, and now we are powerless. Since it is destined to be out of control, then let it go!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them make trouble first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the chaos is turned upside down, as long as they don't directly lead the army to invade our Alpha Kingdom, then let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you survive the period of weakness, and then find a way to get back what you lost now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said in a bad manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't handle it, then destroy it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All major forces want to be chess players, but who will be the chess pieces?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right, the kingdom really shouldn't be involved so much now. The northern countries are not in a hurry, why should we worry about them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three central kingdoms want to go north, so let them in. Even if we poke a hole out of the sky next, we won't be the only ones to do it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said unwillingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little late\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Obviously, the death of Caesar III not only affected the high level of the kingdom, but also spread to the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps affected by the atmosphere, I was invited to the party in the evening. The table full of delicacies from mountains and seas failed to mobilize Hudson's appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the usual banquets, this time there is no good wine or beauties. Smiles on everyone's faces are even rarer, and even if they do appear, they are very reluctant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nature is the most complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the king was alive, the constrained nobles wanted him to die immediately; but Caesar III was really dead, and everyone missed him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the analysis and discussion of the international situation by a group of nobles, most of them have the same judgment as Hudson, and they are pessimistic about the future situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the border nobles in the southern part of the kingdom, they are even more frightened by the current situation. The rear suddenly became the front line of future conflicts, which caught everyone by surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, the southeastern province is pretty good. At the very least, there are still a few mountains in the middle, and there is no need to face the pressure of the Kingdom of Hesse for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that Caesar III died too early. According to everyone's prior estimates, it is believed that the king can still last for three to five years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a long time buffer, the kingdom's debt crisis has basically been resolved; all the emerging nobles in the kingdom, those who can keep their foundations, have gained a firm foothold; the recovered land has almost been reintroduced into the rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces in the south-central part of the kingdom that were less affected by the war have all come out of the shadow of the war and recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength has recovered by seven to eight points. Even if the new monarch has limited ability, he can protect himself in the face of complex international situations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the reality is cruel. Caesar III did not live as long as everyone expected, and all kinds of contradictions that were suppressed before are now in danger of being detonated in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the crowd constantly calling for unity, Hudson knew that unity was getting farther and farther away from the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guys from the Northland didn't show up at the party, but in Hudson's mind, figures gloating over others' misfortune had already appeared one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unity is very important, but it is based on the premise of self-interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps they will not talk about unity until the nobles in various parts of the south are weakened and the kingdom is on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, you are a master of military affairs. Judging from the current international situation, if one day the major powers in the central region want to move northward, where will they choose to start?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Carles' words pushed Hudson to the foreground, and everyone's eyes focused on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Count Calais, this assumption makes no sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The central kingdoms are not monolithic, and we cannot treat them as a whole. Even if they all want to go north, their respective strategic goals are not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, they will join forces in name, but when it comes to specific actions, they will still fight on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open the map of the mainland and you will know that there are too many entry points that the countries in the central region can choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to guard against their invasion, all border provinces in the south of the kingdom must build defense lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe we can be a little more optimistic, they are just testing, and they are not ready to invade the north now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought I was pessimistic enough, but I didn't expect these guys to be even more pessimistic than him. They were all thinking about what to do when the enemy came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good thing to have a sense of crisis, but if you are too nervous, it becomes unfounded worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all problems left over from history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alfa Kingdom has been facing the threat of orcs all year round. Whenever there is a situation, it will be a **** battle, and the sense of crisis has been implanted in everyone's bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way to deal with the crisis is also aimed at the orcs. Now that the venue has shifted to the infighting of the human race, the original traditional thinking mode obviously cannot keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the orcs can go south without any scruples, but the countries in the central region are subject to multiple checks and balances, and they must follow the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for everyone to change their minds in a short while. The only effect Hudson's words brought to everyone was to strengthen everyone's idea of ​​building a defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Withdrew from the discussion circle, Earl Oran came over and took Hudson to the corner, and asked in a low voice:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I heard that you are going to be a father soon, how is Melissa doing now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem like an ordinary statement about family life, but it contains a lot of content. It is one thing to care about the daughter and grandson, but more is for the marriage of the two families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa and the child in her belly are the bond of the alliance between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Earl. Melissa is in very good condition, and the baby in her womb is also healthy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, the birth will be almost at the end of the month. It's a pity that the royal capital is busy now, and I'm afraid I won't be able to go back early! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the regretful Hudson, Earl Oran smiled slightly. Perhaps realizing that the occasion was wrong, after showing a smile, he immediately restrained himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the child will be proud of having a father like you. The situation at home and abroad is very tense now, and it is right for you to stay in the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those guys in the Northland are already starting to move around. You and the Lochnard family are mortal enemies, people in the north should be careful. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Earl Oran's reminder, Hudson immediately realized that trouble was coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the lead of Caesar III, the kingdom's policy of suppressing the nobles in the north would definitely be relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they are loosened, the newly opened branch of the family in the north will have a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they will not lead people to fight there directly, it is still possible to secretly engage in some conspiracy and tricks to force the Koslow family to give up the fief in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead, Hudson found in embarrassment that he could do nothing but remind everyone to be careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they wanted to take revenge, the Koslow family couldn't reach out that long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't fight Sap yourself, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to do that, the conflict will escalate. With a proper way of playing both sides, the final result has a high probability that the two will go down together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    will be able to take advantage of it, and Hudson will never want to hang out in the aristocratic circle. If everyone played like that, who would feel safe?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why, the Holliser family also felt the pressure?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a big family, it is very simple to target a few small nobles, there is nothing to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if even the emerging aristocrats like the Holliser family felt the pressure, it would be another situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not that serious for the time being, but after the news of His Majesty's death came out, the nobles of the North held a group meeting, and it took two days to discuss it before it ended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific content of their discussion is unknown, but it can be seen from the happy faces of everyone when they left that the meeting was fruitful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the family relocation this time was a wrong decision. Compared with the five major families in the Northland, the Holliser family is really too weak! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem with the newly recovered seven provinces in northern Xinjiang of the Kingdom is that they are too close to the five major families of the Northern Lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were no shackles to restrain the five major families, what would the nobles in the seven northern provinces who hadn't even moved out of their homes fight against them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because you haven't made a move now doesn't mean you won't make a move in the future. Maybe they worked so hard to relocate the population and supplies, and in the end they were making wedding dresses for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is no medicine for regret in the world. After taking this step, there is no possibility of turning back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either go all out and gain a firm foothold in the north; or fall into the dust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't worry too much. Those guys in the Northland are powerful, but they also have many enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they can unite a group of nobles who went north, they dare not act rashly. After this period of weakness is over, everything will improve. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson comforted him insincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely because he knew that there was a big pit in the north that he chose to take root in the southeastern province. At the beginning, he had secretly persuaded Earl Oran, but the Holliser family was determined to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on whether the new monarch can suppress the five major families in the Northern Territory at the next royal capital meeting, otherwise the future northern border is doomed to be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The succession of the new king, the state funeral, everything is being prepared step by step. Whether it is a group of nobles in the kingdom or representatives of various countries, they have all realized their peace during this period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson's heart is not peaceful, and his intuition tells him: Behind the tranquility often represents a greater crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, Your Highness invites you to discuss matters in the palace.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this news, Hudson couldn't help but wrinkle. The more critical the moment, the more it is necessary to cut the mess quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, Crown Prince Caesar might as well ascend to the throne earlier if he engages in these cumbersome etiquette procedures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king and the crown prince have never been a concept. As long as the crown is not worn for a day, things have the potential to change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the attendants into the meeting hall, Hudson immediately realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you say it, Crown Prince Caesar is also the future monarch of everyone. Even if you don't like it in your heart, you have to live with face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is that everyone didn't even bother to pretend, and put on a bitter face, and many people glared at Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The doubt didn't last long, and Hudson's face became gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, since the beginning of my Alpha Kingdom a hundred years ago, the Holy See has nothing to do with the succession of the monarch. Now you ask the Holy See to come and be crowned, what is it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is impatient, it's that Crown Prince Caesar is too nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is the arch-enemy of the Holy See. At this time, the people of the Holy See are crowned, isn't it a compromise with the enemy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the obvious reasons, the more important thing is that he does not deal with the Holy See. They all started by stepping on the Holy See, and the kingdom repaired the relationship with the Holy See. Hudson was definitely the most injured one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, don't worry. It's just a ceremony, and it won't harm the real interests of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the Holy See also made a promise, as long as we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Crown Prince Caesar could finish speaking, Hudson forcibly interrupted: \"Your Highness has such a big heart, the battle between kingship and theocracy is just an ordinary ceremony in your eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that His Highness did this, did he consider the political consequences brought about by it? Leaving aside the domestic ones, let's simply analyze the international influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact is that our relationship with the Frankish Kingdom will definitely break down, and our relationship with several other major human nations will also deteriorate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the promise of the Holy See, as long as you read the history books more when you are free, you will not have such illusions! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, all the great nobles who opposed the Holy See spoke in agreement, and in an instant it became a verbal siege of the crown prince by a group of fief nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The court ministers who were supposed to stand on the side of the king and fight with everyone on the grounds of reason, are now also watching from the sidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, everyone is not interested in the proposal of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson vaguely realized that something was wrong. Since everyone was against it, why did Crown Prince Caesar do this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, be quiet, this is not a vegetable market, what's so noisy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, who will host the coronation ceremony is decided by the new king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since His Royal Highness has decided to invite people from the Holy See to preside over it, let them be in charge. Don't go beyond the rules for your own self-interest! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero's words instantly detonated the audience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is definitely big news that the Northern Noble Group and Xinjun are getting mixed up. The difficulty was that Crown Prince Caesar dared to make such a proposal, and his affection won them supporters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the opposition is the most fierce. Except for Hudson, the rest are all veteran nobles in the south-central part of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles + emerging nobles were pulled over, and the two camps formed a new balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, the coronation ceremony should be handed over to Archbishop Tyron, and the matter of inviting the Holy See will be over!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the dust settled, Hudson, who won the victory, could not see a smile on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When talking with Earl Oran yesterday, he was still worried about the threat of the northern nobles. Now that the two sides have merged, there must be a story behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't think of a third person other than the Crown Prince Caesar who can match the relationship between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, he understood that the proposal made by Crown Prince Caesar just now did not really intend to invite people from the Holy See to come and be crowned, but a deliberate temptation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in addition to testing the reactions of these people, Crown Prince Caesar is still sending a signal to the outside world: I am in a hurry, and I will go to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't talk about contradictions, in the face of interests, this stuff has always been worthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all planned, no wonder all the ministers in the DPRK were silent on the sidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 358": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 358: Assassination\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    came out of the palace in a daze, Hudson's mind was still buzzing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerging nobles are difficult to mix, and the bosses of emerging aristocrats are even more difficult to mix. Judging from the current situation, you can tell that everyone doesn't take him to play when they start things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had known earlier that this was a plot by Crown Prince Caesar, he would not have bothered to be the first bird to offend this person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that if he continued to toss like this, the reputation accumulated on the battlefield would be wiped out sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Success is also a battlefield, and defeat is also a battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very clear that the main reason everyone rejects him is not because he is a new nobleman, but because he is too perfect on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is a 180-year-old man, everyone probably recognizes him. There are only a few days left and right, and it is enough to pay high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson is only in his early twenties, and he can still be active in the kingdom's political arena for decades, or even hundreds of years if he has a thicker skin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little brain knows that this kind of potential power minister must be suppressed in advance. Otherwise, let Hudson continue to operate smoothly, what will happen to our younger generations in the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conflict of core interests determines that no matter how hard Hudson works, he cannot be truly accepted by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is: the old aristocrat is worried that he will seize everyone's interests after he grows up;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thinking of the royal family is more complicated. On the one hand, he needs his military talents to deter foreign enemies; on the other hand, he is worried that Hudson will threaten the royal power when he grows bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the combined blessing of many factors, Hudson, who is good at attracting allies, fell into an embarrassing situation of isolation and helplessness in the kingdom's political arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just political troubles, that's all. The key is that the vigilant positions held by all parties have greatly restricted Hudson's actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the disputes in the southeast province, we know that most of the time, he was forced to take a defensive position instead of taking the initiative to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he didn't think of a strong wave, but when he thought of the heroes who died young in history, Hudson dismissed the idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that as long as he dares to take the lead now, he will either die young or add another general to the cult organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect to change jobs, you can't get along in the Alpha Kingdom, and you will only die worse if you change to another country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the same anywhere, when your appearance harms the interests of others, you are a cult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't change the world, then adapt to the world. After referring to the family histories of countless great nobles, Hudson found their common successful experience, that is - \"gou\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, Hudson has a better card now. You don't even need to work hard, as long as you spend time slowly, you will be able to step into the core of power when you get older.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The euphemistic name is: Grinding your temper, in fact, it is climbing too fast, making everyone uncomfortable and insecure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    easy to say, hard to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't been severely beaten by the society, and once he was in power, it might not be possible for him to choose to be silent at a young age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After drinking a cup of tea, Hudson regained his composure and began to sort out the content of the palace meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar took the risk of offending all the old nobles in the country, and there must be other reasons behind such a big show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inviting people from the Holy See to come and be crowned seems like a joke, but Hudson knows very well that this matter may not be impossible to become a reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current international situation, if Crown Prince Caesar dares to send out an invitation, there is a high probability that Pius VII will come to preside over the ceremony in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the Holy See is stinky in the eyes of the nobles, but its influence among the people is still deep-rooted, and there are even a group of supporters lurking within the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obtaining the support of these people is also of great significance to stabilizing the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these factors alone are not enough for Crown Prince Caesar to do things so absolutely. Everyone is a decent person, and a wave of hints is enough, why do you have to say it yourself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Crown Prince Caesar couldn't hold his breath, the guys with rich political experience in the royal family would stop him. The only explanation is: deliberately!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wrote four words on the table with his fingers - \"land annexation\", Hudson sighed deeply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who watched Crown Prince Caesar win over knows it. Either the lord who annexed his neighbors; or the new risen lord whose foundation is unstable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder they dared to use a group of veteran nobles as rafts. In fact, the two sides were on opposite sides from the very beginning, and there was no room for compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really look into it, the instigators are still the five major families in the Northland. Although they have made themselves notorious because of their large-scale land annexation, they have gained a lot of benefits!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is because of these benefits that they have jumped from the frontier lords to the top family in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are ready-made role models out there, and it is impossible for everyone not to have ideas in their hearts. The only problem is that there are no orcs in the south, so they can't play the trick of borrowing a knife to kill someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the introduction of foreign enemies is not enough, in the midst of the internal struggle of the human race, everyone has a tacit understanding not to kill the nobles. As long as you don't die directly on the battlefield, you can basically save your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't play with rough methods, then play with technical ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the rise of the nobles in the Northland, everyone's integrity was relatively high. They waited for the decline of the minor nobles, and then waited for an opportunity to annex them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different now, it's too time-consuming to wait for the little nobles to decline, and every careerist has learned how to play tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know about other places. Anyway, in the southeast province in recent months, more than a dozen minor nobles had accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or the crime was punished with high fines; or the outside business lost money; or the territory was robbed;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how reasonable the story sounds, in the end, the nobles involved were all severely injured by the torment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless for the little nobleman to find out that something is wrong. He has no evidence in hand, so can he still expect others to take the initiative to admit it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't pierce the window paper, after the family declines, you can still keep an empty title to survive; if you open the window, you will either be \"killed\" violently, or \"be\" colluded with a cult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is ironic that the biggest black hand that caused the downfall of the minor nobles was not a few large and middle nobles in the province, but the infighting among the minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governors and sheriffs everywhere have only done two things - raising taxes and fueling the flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this tossing method, if the kingdom does not take timely action to stop it, it is estimated that the southeastern province will be almost divided up before Crown Prince Caesar establishes his prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sorting out rationally, Hudson was surprised to find that he actually underestimated Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much the follow-up impact of his rage during the day was, he did deter many veteran nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before you can figure out the quality of his new boss, everyone's next actions will definitely be restrained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, if being the boss cannot rely on high morals and prestige to convince the public, then making his subordinates fear is also a good management method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends on his next performance. As long as the current strong personality is not broken, no matter how powerful the political means are, he might not be able to become the second Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, at the funeral of Caesar III, Hudson couldn't help but want to laugh when he saw the big nobles with red eye circles attending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of old foxes were so bluffed. But it's normal to think about it. When people are old and smart, they will inevitably have to think more when they encounter things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with a mad king who flips the table over at the slightest disagreement, anyone will feel frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the family property left by Caesar III, the royal family now has the ability to bring down any big noble in the country. But this kind of power is still in the hands of the young and energetic king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is safe, and Hudson is relieved. There is no turmoil in the country, and no matter how tense the international situation is, it will not directly affect the kingdom for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let others fight the war! Farming with peace of mind is king, and Master Hudson is a peace-loving master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"ah!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Catch the assassin!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a scream, and the crowd immediately shouted \"catch the assassin\". The orderly funeral scene was instantly disrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The face slap came so suddenly, from heaven to hell, Hudson didn't know how to describe his mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the question is:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who was assassinated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Was the assassination successful?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few important people attending the funeral, and the death of any one of them can cause a storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who was assassinated?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Father's funeral was disturbed, and his enthronement ceremony was also destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the tradition of the Alpha Kingdom, the old king is usually buried in the morning, and the crown prince takes over the crown and is crowned in the afternoon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is such a trouble, the ceremony will definitely be affected. Encountering this kind of thing on the day of succession, it is a proper big \"bad\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happened, someone must be responsible for it. But the most important thing right now is to find out who was assassinated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a small and medium-sized noble in the country is okay, but if a big man in the world is unfortunately killed, it will be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, it was Prince Claude of the Kingdom of Hesse who was assassinated!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Earl Francis, Minister of Foreign Affairs, finished speaking, Crown Prince Caesar's face turned ashes, and he was really afraid of something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Kingdom of Hesse was eager to try, and wanted to wait for the opportunity to go north to get a share of the pie. Now that this happened, it was simply an excuse to the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the palace guards come over immediately to maintain order and arrest the murderer!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, immediately send someone over to see if Prince Claude is safe now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have already happened, so it can only be remedied as much as possible. Now I can only hope that Prince Claude is fine, then there is still room for maneuver in everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happens to Prince Claude...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't dare to think about the horrible consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officials on the side were also shocked. The prince of a neighboring country had an accident at his own house. This legendary thing happened before their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The representatives of the Kingdom of Hesse did not allow outsiders to come close to visit, even Caesar IV has been kept out of the door since the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the high-level officials of the kingdom, including Hudson, have gloomy and terrifying faces at the moment, and they are all anxiously waiting for the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, the Emerald Palace is still brightly lit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you found out the identity of the assassin? How did you get in?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked with a livid face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't know the life and death of Prince Claude, then you can only start with the assassin, dig out the real culprit, and reduce the responsibility of the Alpha Kingdom as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the assassin was smeared with evil potion. After we caught him, his body quickly turned into a puddle of blood, leaving no valuable clues at the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to people who have seen the assassin, his name is Cyrus, and he was a fief baron in the southeastern province before his death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has never left the kingdom, so he should have nothing to do with Prince Claude, let alone hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We suspect that this person is an imposter. The real Baron Cyrus may have been killed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For further investigation of the identity of Baron Cyrus, the Southeast Province still needs to provide relevant information. It is not ruled out that there is a suspicion of being stimulated and wanting to retaliate against society. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The answer of the Grand Duke of Newfoundland directly pushed the southeastern province to the forefront. Hudson and Earl Pierce looked at each other with sad expressions on their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"People sit at home, but pots come from heaven.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Hudson had greeted the entire Assassin family. If you want to get rid of the blame and find someone who has weight when you do something, why do you want to catch these \"little characters\"?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassinated a prince, Hudson said that his physical strength was limited and he couldn't carry such a big pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he thought that the current situation was quite safe. Even if a conflict broke out, the flames of war would not spread to the southeastern province immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no guarantee. The assassination of Prince Claude is involved, and the situation has become complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, then the Kingdom of Hesse will definitely ask the Kingdom of Alpha to hand over the murderer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, the Alpha Kingdom simply cannot fulfill such a seemingly reasonable request.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassins turned into a pool of blood, and all the clues were cut off here. I want to continue to search, but I don't know how to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't find someone to take the blame, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Alpha Kingdom is willing to do that, there are still people who are selfless and willing to take the blame, and the Hesse Kingdom cannot accept it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the excuse of sending them to the door is not used to make use of it, wouldn't it appear that they are political idiots?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the southeast province will do our best to collect detailed information about Baron Cyrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to say that he was motivated to plan the assassination would be nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a minor nobleman, under normal circumstances, he would not even have the chance to get close to Prince Claude, let alone launch an assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This assassination case was clearly premeditated. Otherwise, Baron Cyrus, who is just an intermediate knight, will be expelled by his guards even if he happens to meet Prince Claude! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce retorted unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blame cannot be reckless. If it is defined as: Baron Cyrus was stimulated and wanted to take revenge on the society, the assassination was launched, and he, the governor, is also to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even investigations in this direction will not work. Although Earl Pierce has always paid attention to eating appearances, he still uses shady methods in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't misunderstand, Your Excellency, I'm just talking about the facts, and I don't mean to blame you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The explanation given by the Grand Duke of Newfoundland did not satisfy Earl Pierce, but the prime minister talked about this point, and he couldn't hold on to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After giving a cold drink to express dissatisfaction, he kept silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be just a possibility analysis, but it is actually an in-depth hammering on the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warning all the big nobles, don't do things too extreme, otherwise the small nobles will make troubles, and they will be unable to eat and go around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"alright!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need to dispute this issue. Our next task is not only to investigate the identity of the assassin and the mastermind behind the scenes, but also to prepare for the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether Prince Claude has an accident or not, the Kingdom of Hesse will not let it go. What followed was another political turmoil, and the Kingdom had to come up with effective countermeasures. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV's voice fell, and the hall immediately became noisy. A group of great nobles whispered to each other and started a discussion on this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the ability to listen to six channels, Hudson continued to extract effective information from the conversations of everyone. Unfortunately, no good solution has been found, but many bad ideas have been proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this kind of emergency discussion requires quick decision-making, which cannot make full use of the ingenuity of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, they let their staff analyze various situations before choosing the one they think is the most beneficial to implement, instead of trying to figure out a plan by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why many noble families are still thriving despite their poor abilities. In essence, the family's training direction for them since childhood is: know people, employ people...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, are you feeling better?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Tatara asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Hesse's envoy to the Kingdom of Alpha, his prince was assassinated in his own area of ​​responsibility, and he was also to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Earl Tatara. As soon as the assassin approached me, he was stopped by the guards. The assassination and injury during the day were just a show for the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of rare good thing, since I caught up with it, I have to get some benefits from the Alpha Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Claude said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassins?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, this is clearly his nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Professional ability is not bad, even the location of the assassination is perfectly chosen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has no interest in the mastermind behind the scenes. On this issue, the Alpha Kingdom will be more anxious than the victim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the host can't find out the black hand, he, an outsider, can't find out even more. Instead of wasting time here, it is better to think about how to maximize the benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, you mean to take the opportunity to negotiate with the Alpha Kingdom?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Tatara asked pretending to be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't be too smart when you're a younger brother. It's okay for a feudal noble to be a little bit more capable, but for a court earl like him, being smarter than the boss is the number one taboo in the workplace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you negotiating for?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly ask the Alpha Kingdom to hand over the murderer and the mastermind behind it. Let's talk about the rest after they deliver it to their door! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Claude said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no one who comes directly to ask for benefits. If it is spread, it will appear that he is very cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how great the benefits of the exchange are, as the prince of the Kingdom of Hesse, he cannot be materialized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The envoy was sent away, and Prince Claude couldn't sleep at night. What happened during the day did not stimulate him in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that what stimulated him was not the farce-like assassination, but Caesar IV who ascended the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is of the same age. Caesar IV has begun to rule a big country, but he can only visit around on behalf of the Hesse royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even the job of visiting people was his hard work. Otherwise, he can only be a rice borer in the capital now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all because I didn't grasp it well when I was reincarnated, and I was a step behind the elder brother above. So he became a crown prince, but he became an ordinary prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like the prince is awesome. He surpassed the end of countless people when he was born, but this is also his own end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Hesse, where the class is infinitely solidified, everyone strictly defends the fiefdom, and even a prince does not give him extra land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal family's territory will not be split easily, even if it is canonized, it is a title in name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the king's father was around, he was still able to bear the name of a prince and enjoy a great reputation on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the kingship changes, all that is left to him is a false noble. The level of the title depends on the specific performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are excellent in all aspects and have made great contributions to the kingdom, then you will have the opportunity to enter the court and participate in politics with the title of Grand Duke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing happens, what is left to him is a vain title of earl, leading the royal gold issued by the royal family, in front of the rice borer who has nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that the assassination case was the biggest opportunity he encountered. So after the incident, the news was immediately blocked and no one was allowed to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what to do next, Claude was confused again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The death of Caesar III was also an accident for the Principality of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to their prior estimates, they believed that Caesar III could still live for another three to five years, and the deployment against the Alpha Kingdom was also based on estimates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the fire, they were not prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are not the only two countries in the Aslant Continent. When making decisions, the reactions of all countries in the continent must be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it would be embarrassing if just as soon as a war is started, a big country will jump out to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the Alpha Kingdom is not a soft persimmon. Even if it has not yet recovered its strength, it cannot be defeated in a short while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on Claude's understanding of his father, he would never aggressively gamble on the fate of the country for such a \"small matter\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the two countries go to war, Claude doesn't want it to be because of himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is full of uncertainties. It's good that the Kingdom of Hesse won. If he loses, he becomes a sinner of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Got up from the bed, picked up a pen and paper, and started writing in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what the kingdom's final decision is, anyway, his anti-war stance must be shown, which is the political awareness of the royal family's children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving the palace, Hudson and Earl Pierce went to the residence of the Dalton family together. Regardless of the relationship between the two before, they are all unlucky people on the same boat now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, all the nobles in the capital of the southeast province gathered here to wait for the news. Seeing the two people coming in, everyone hastily greeted them and asked them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go back to your seats and sit down! Things are more complicated than expected, and I can't explain it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassin came in with the identity of Baron Cyrus. You guys are familiar with him. Have you found anything wrong with him recently? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Governor Pierce's words, everyone hurriedly retreated, expressing that they were not familiar with Baron Cyrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the assassination that took place under the watchful eyes of everyone has already spread. The big case of assassinating a prince would be life-threatening if involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the relationship with Baron Cyrus is on weekdays, now I have to insist: I don't know each other well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's enough! I'm asking about your relationship with Baron Cyrus, not the assassin. Why are you rushing to get rid of the relationship?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who is not familiar with him and who is familiar with him, don't I know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you continue to evade and refuse to tell the truth, then I don't care. Go and talk to the investigation team yourself! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it a question of familiarity now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to the problem is that it must be true: the identity of Baron Selous is false, the real Baron Selous was killed long ago, and the current assassin is someone who is impersonated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it would be even more perfect if the body of Baron Cyrus could be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is almost impossible. Since people want to do this kind of thing, they will naturally handle it from beginning to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Baron Selous was very normal along the way, but the day before the ceremony, he suddenly became less talkative and barely communicated with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We took the initiative to talk to him, but he used the excuse that His Majesty passed away and he was in a bad mood! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sikolari's words have confused many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cyrus doesn't talk much, and if this is considered abnormal, then they are no normal people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are smart people among the little nobles, and they immediately understood the meaning behind the words. It doesn't matter whether Baron Cyrus has anomalies, the key is that they need him to have anomalies now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassin has turned into a puddle of blood, and his true identity has long been undocumented. At this time, as long as they insist that this person is not Baron Cyrus, then the assassin is not Baron Cyrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Sicorari is right. Shortly after arriving in the capital, Baron Cyrus became withdrawn and stood up, basically avoiding contact with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must not have been murdered by someone, the murderer pretended to be him and sneaked in...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in twos and threes opened their mouths to add, and the scene of Baron Selus being impersonated was presented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kayo, record what everyone said, summarize it and hand it over to the investigation team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is any missing part of the news about Baron Cyrus, please communicate directly with Viscount Kayo afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issues we will discuss next are related to everyone's wealth and family inheritance, so please be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the international situation continues to deteriorate, our southeastern province has also changed from the rear of the kingdom to the frontier of international conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The existence of the Black Rock Mountain Range has prevented countless disasters for us, but the narrowest part of the Black Rock Mountain Range is less than a hundred kilometers away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone is willing to pay a high price, it is not impossible to open a road from here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the speculation becomes reality, Blood Moon County will be reduced to the forefront. It turned out that the line of defense that blocked the tide of beasts could not stop the enemy's soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the strategic security of the province, after discussing with the Earl of Hudson, I decided to build a line of defense in Blood Moon County to prevent accidents! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Governor Pierce turned his attention to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't need to talk nonsense about the meaning of building the blood moon defense line, everyone must know it in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation in the kingdom is complicated, and we can only rely on ourselves for many things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency and I made this decision because of the situation. Whether the Kingdom of Hesse will borrow from the Blackstone Mountains, no one can say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether a blood moon defense line can block the enemy's soldiers, no one can tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But one thing is certain, having a defense line is definitely better than having no defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Blood Moon line of defense is strong enough, even if a war does break out, the enemy will choose to detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is the Black Rock Mountain Range behind, and it may be attacked by monsters at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a good choice to put the logistics line of the army under the eyes of Warcraft for a long time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried his best to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much the Blood Moon defense line can play is temporarily unknown. But once this project starts construction, the steel industry under his command will be able to turn around immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money delivered to the door is not earned for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The kingdom even encourages border nobles to build more castles and fortresses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a well-behaved request for instructions is naturally not because the nobles respect the king more. Everyone's main purpose is to ask for money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, did the kingdom allocate funds to build defense lines in the past?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current financial situation of the Alpha Kingdom, if one word can be used to describe it, it would be: poor!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very poor!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very poor!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is a matter related to money, Caesar IV has no headaches. Even the recent assassination of Prince Claude is far less troublesome than the kingdom's financial problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is on his own territory. To find out the life and death of Prince Claude, Caesar IV can still do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the person is not dead, follow-up issues can be discussed easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a few days, a cult organization will announce that it is responsible for the assassination, followed by the Kingdom organization manpower encirclement, and finally the two sides will exchange interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The processes are all ready-made, just follow the template to prepare. If you have done enough for the face, and given a certain amount of compensation in the face, the matter is considered to be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, financial holes are unsolvable problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The funeral of the old king just ended, and the enthronement of the new king is also a big expense, which makes the kingdom's financial deficit even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Kingdom does not have a clear decree to make regulations in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in the past, when the provinces built defense lines, the kingdom would provide subsidies of varying amounts according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the large amount of subsidies in the northern Xinjiang region, the subsidies in other provinces are all symbolic, and the main compensation method is tax reduction or exemption. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Grand Duke of Newfoundland finished speaking, the Minister of Finance, Marquis Delgado, stood up and refused politely: \"No! There is absolutely no tax reduction or exemption now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, due to the impact of the war, tax revenues in the northern part of the kingdom have been greatly reduced, especially in the newly recovered seven provinces, which have not received a penny of tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current kingdom's finances are mainly provided by the central and southern provinces. The southern provinces that proposed to build a defense line are all major tax-paying provinces in the kingdom, accounting for almost one-third of the fiscal revenue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the newly levied repayment tax, these provinces contributed nearly 40%. Once tax exemption is given to them, the kingdom's finances will collapse immediately! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The data will not lie. Because of the ability to collect tariffs, the financial contribution of the border provinces is obviously much higher than that of the inland provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Already short of money, if the most important financial revenue is cut off, there will be a problem not to go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The financial problem is indeed severe, but we have to consider the proposals of the provinces to build defense lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the changes in the international situation, these provinces have changed from the rear to a new defense center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the finances are unable to provide money, we have to take a gesture and give some appeasement to the local nobles. It is best to encourage them to complete the construction of the defense line alone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this proposal is really embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, as the Minister of Military Affairs of the Kingdom, with the treasury empty, he can only rely on the local nobles to complete the construction of national defense projects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, they can also convene a noble council to raise construction funds from across the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the major provinces of the kingdom are under a lot of financial pressure at present, and each of them is still in the economic recovery period. Continue to raise taxes, which is to force the small nobles to go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are these provinces capable of completing these projects alone?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To guard your own homeland, you are not afraid that the nobles in this province will not do their best, but you are afraid that they will be powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it depends on the determination of the great nobles. The provinces that need to build defense lines are mostly richer in economy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few big nobles are willing to spend their money, gather the strength of the whole province, and build a solid line of defense, it should not be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the current threat of war is not great, we still have enough time for them to determine the construction period according to the actual situation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to retain the kingdom's finances, he also tried his best. Now it is necessary to save where it can be saved, and try to save where it cannot be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce expenses, the salaries of kingdom officials can only take 70%, and even the king's annuity has been stopped by the Ministry of Finance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this was not stopped by the Marquis Delgado, but was proposed by Caesar III in order to unite people during his reign.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For various activities, the budget cuts are even more severe. The most typical is the holding of the noble council, and the standard of food provided by the kingdom plummets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original Warcraft meat, spices, delicacies from mountains and seas, as well as all kinds of snacks and fruits available around the clock, are all gone now, and only ordinary beef and mutton + bread are left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct consequence is that the nobles stopped coming to eat, and one by one started their own small stoves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Marquis Delgado was not only not annoyed, but cut off this part of the budget with a smile, forcing the council to directly cancel the food supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many other similar operations. It was rumored in the outside world that Marquis Delgado got into the eyes of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such frenzied throttling is only to ensure that the kingdom's finances can be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, what do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked quite emotionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not distrust, it's mainly my own finance minister who has too many great ways to save money. Most of them are successful, but if you do too much, there will always be mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Majesty, I will come forward to coordinate this matter. When it comes to their own safety, I am not afraid that they will not do their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Southern border is different from northern border, there is no need to transport food and grass for thousands of miles, and the cost of building a defense line here is not that scary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, relying on their own strength alone, there are still certain difficulties in individual provinces in order to build complete fortifications, and they must coordinate other provinces to provide support. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that coordinating the relationship between all parties is a proper chore, but there is no way, if he is not the prime minister, the king has to do it himself, and no one else is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Caesar IV succeeded to the throne, although he has performed well, it is still unknown whether he has the ability to coordinate the relationship between all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, the aftermath will only be more difficult. Simply go in person, relying on the prestige of serving as prime minister for many years, everyone has to give some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the griffin cavalry flying by from the sky, Prince Claude, who was wandering in the garden, hurried back to the ward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you declare to the outside world that you are recuperating, then you have to look like you are recuperating. In case people see him alive and kicking, how can he be ripped off?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is the most magical thing. If the Alpha Kingdom is really ready to turn against the Hesse Kingdom, it might bite him back and say: The assassination was directed and acted by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the probability of this happening is very low. The assassins came in as aristocrats of the Alpha Kingdom, and this alone was doomed, no matter how hard they tried to shake the blame, they couldn't get rid of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the continent of Aslant are very concerned about their own image, and no one wants to wear the hat of a rogue country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is common to start wars for honor. Playing tricks at this time is equivalent to directly fighting against the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Tatara, how are you talking with the Alpha people?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Claude asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trapped in the house every day, strolling in the garden has to worry about being seen by the griffin cavalry in the sky. But in the past few days, there are a lot of griffin cavalry above his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sent someone to inquire, and the answer they gave was: In order to protect his personal safety, the patrol force was specially strengthened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the progress is not very smooth. According to the collected information, the Alpha Kingdom has already started preparing for war, and several southern provinces are preparing to build defense lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the southeast province is progressing the most smoothly. It is said that they have completed the initial planning of the defense line. It is planned to invest 300,000 laborers and build a steel defense line in three years...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Count Tatara could finish speaking, Prince Claude interrupted: \"The Alpha man is crazy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We didn't do anything, they started preparing for battle. The war with the orcs has just ended, where do they have the financial resources to carry out these projects? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he made a fuss, it's that the Alpha Kingdom's reaction was too abnormal. War has never been said to be fought, and it can be fought immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention two big countries, even if two nobles are engaged in a fight, it will take some time to prepare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually choose a time and battlefield that both parties agree on, and wait until everyone is ready before leading the team to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happens, you can also unilaterally announce the extension. Most of the time, this request will be accepted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars between countries, although not so disciplined, there are still many things that need to be prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no need to conduct national recruitment, it is very simple. The strategic materials are prepared, and the king can go to the battlefield with an order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you need to mobilize the private army of nobles to join the war, things will become troublesome. In the event of foreign invasion, this kind of mobilization is faster, and it is estimated that it will take a few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you take the initiative to launch a war abroad, it will take at least half a year to coordinate the internal relations between the princes, and it will take at least half a year to prepare strategic materials and recruit troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still in theory, but in practice, more problems will arise. After all, the Kingdom of Hesse has been around for hundreds of years and has never fought a national mobilization war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization efficiency is really high, and there are only a few countries that face aliens. The specific mobilization efficiency depends entirely on the frequency of wars with alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why many countries have advantages in population, economy, number of masters, and weapons and equipment, but they lag behind others in the ranking of powerful countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, I heard that the cost of building the defense line in the southeastern province will be fully raised by the local government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fundraising meeting will be held tomorrow at the residence of the Dalton family. Whether it's a bluff or if construction is really going to start, we'll know when tomorrow's meeting ends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the two powerful factions in the southeastern province, Governor Pierce and the Earl of Hudson, are both promoters of this project. As long as the two of them are determined to build it, other people's opposition will be invalid. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Tatara patiently explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way of thinking determines the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the Alpha Kingdom still follow the extreme law of the jungle to compete with the orcs. If you relax your vigilance, you will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The subjective influence in the subconscious made them ignore that the enemy had changed. Still holding on to the set of concepts of dealing with orcs, facing the current international situation, wishful thinking regards neighbors as imaginary enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deviation of this concept fell into the eyes of Prince Claude, that is: Alpha people are a bunch of lunatics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Named Fei Haiyue, online collection of country names, province names, county names, mountain names, river names, dangerous place names...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send everything you can think of, the time has come for readers to show your imagination.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In addition to the nobles from the southeastern province, nobles from other regions and representatives from various countries also came to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The euphemism is: learn from fundraising experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the country have really learned from experience. As long as the southeastern province succeeds in raising funds, they can follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has a herd mentality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficiency of the southeast province is so high, except for Hudson, the hawkish boss who keeps fooling around, the most important thing is-to have money in his pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representatives from various countries joined in the fun, purely to see if the Alpha Kingdom was bluffing or preparing to play for real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final result of the fundraising meeting will directly affect their future foreign policy towards the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the nobles in the hall, Governor Pierce, who had organized the language, said straight to the point:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Our southeast province is close to the Black Rock Mountain Range, and is threatened by animal hordes all the year round, and the people suffer unspeakably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to change this situation, after many discussions, we unanimously decided to rebuild the Blood Moon defense line to block the beast tide from outside the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inviting everyone here today is mainly to solve the problem of funding for the construction of the defense line. The preliminary budget requires an investment of 3.8 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the actual construction should not cost so much money. The biggest expenses for building fortifications are labor, food and raw materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can recruit serfs for construction, and the labor cost is directly saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raw materials Except for some materials that need to be purchased, the main construction materials can be obtained locally, and most of the expenses can be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food, this piece cannot be saved, and it cannot be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, our southeastern province is originally a grain-producing area. Since the end of the war last year, the military rations provided by everyone to northern Xinjiang have also been saved, which is just used for engineering construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that everyone has a heavy financial burden, I decided after discussing with the Earl of Hudson that we will not forcefully apportion the expenses this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has money to give money, someone to give people, someone to give food to food, and material to give supplies, and fulfill their respective obligations according to their own actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have any ideas and suggestions, you can speak freely now! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the calm expressions of the nobles in the southeast province, everyone knew that this was discussed in advance. When formulating strategies, they also deliberately tilted towards the minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those in the know know that this is an appeasement from the Dalton family to the little nobles. After all, what happened before chilled the hearts of many little nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the threat of foreign enemies is coming, we need everyone to help each other. Naturally, we must first deal with internal relations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to everyone's fundraising model of \"money gives money, someone gives people, food gives food, and materials give materials\", theoretically all nobles can complete their respective obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is especially beneficial to a group of minor nobles who are on the verge of bankruptcy. During the slack season, sending the serfs in the territory to repair the defense line can save a lot of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in this way, there are many problems. Most of the minor nobles in the province will choose to send out people. What about other materials needed for the project?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, for many aristocrats, the least valuable thing is manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the slack season, even if all the labor force in the territory is sent to repair the defense line, it will not affect everyone's daily life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final result will most likely be a surplus of labor and a shortage of other materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing everyone's suspicious eyes, Hudson stood up from his seat and said slowly: \"If you have no other opinions, then this fundraising will be carried out according to the governor's proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Labor force, food, and other materials are all calculated according to market prices. No matter what method you take, you only need to complete the corresponding obligation share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The project budget will be divided among the counties, and everyone will directly multiply the project budget by the proportion of the original obligations in the county, which is the share that everyone needs to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation, the labor force, various materials, and food provided by you may not match the needs of the project, so your Excellency the Governor and I decided to let you declare first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow-up coordination will be jointly undertaken by the Dalton family and the Koslow family. If we can't coordinate, the two of us will work together to ensure the smooth completion of the Blood Moon defense line! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, the representatives of various countries who were planning to watch the excitement were completely dumbfounded. Questions involuntarily came up in my mind: Are all the great nobles in the Alpha Kingdom so reckless?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountered a problem, the big nobles took the initiative to jump out to cover the situation, obviously trying to let the small and medium nobles take advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either they all operate in this way, what other projects can't be done?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is the construction of the defense line expensive?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply a joke. Taking the entire southeastern province as a unit, all the materials needed to build the Blood Moon line of defense can be self-raised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the last gold coin doesn't need to be paid out directly, and the project is completed only by the internal coordination of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that needs to be tested in the southeastern province is organizational ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the mobilization situation of the Alpha Kingdom during the war, we know that they have a lot of experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific defense line construction can be copied directly from the north. The fortifications that can stop the orcs can also stop the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there was a real fight, the battle would not be that intense. After all, human soldiers are much smarter than those low-level orcs with poor brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no surprises. After the two big bosses finished their speeches, a group of nobles from the southeastern provinces began to declare in twos and threes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fundraising meeting went so smoothly without any disturbance, which really opened up the eyes of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the kingdom are alright. Similar operations don't happen much in everyone's life, but it's not without cases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Representatives from various countries are different. From the eyes of everyone, it can be seen that they are terrified. It is estimated that what happened today will shock them for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly simple fundraising meeting revealed something far from simple. The dedication of the great nobles of the Alpha Kingdom is just the tip of the iceberg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really scares everyone is the unity of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has inquired beforehand that the Dalton family and the Koslow family are deadly rivals. The two families are crowded in the southeastern province, and there are countless frictions in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal circumstances, such two families should hold each other back. Whatever you support, we oppose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the interests involved are large enough; or in a life-and-death crisis, if you don't cooperate, everyone will die together, and then it is possible to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is very embarrassing. The two families that were supposed to stab each other started to cooperate without even seeing the shadow of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the so-called Hesse threat is purely wishful thinking. At present, there is no sign of the Kingdom of Hesse sending troops at all, let alone fighting across the Blackstone Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the distance between the two sides is less than a hundred kilometers, if the army really wants to cross from here, it will not be easy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a passage is opened up, heavy troops must be sent to guard the passage to ensure their own logistical security.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the nobles in the southeastern provinces who suffer from deep persecution paranoia mostly think that once the war breaks out, the Hessians will come here to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The theoretical basis that supports everyone's conclusion is the orc. In the war of orc invasion not long ago, the Beamon army detoured all the way, interspersed with many countries, trying to stab Alpha in the eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't led the expeditionary force back to rescue in time, the empty southern provinces might have been successfully attacked by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is fine to run for thousands of miles, and it is naturally not a problem to open a passage less than 100 kilometers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether other people believe it or not, Governor Pierce believed it anyway, and with Mr. Hudson helping the flames, everyone quickly came to the conclusion that the Kingdom of Hesse is planning to invade the Kingdom of Alpha from the Blackstone Mountains!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a life-and-death crisis, we must unite!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the dispute between the Dalton family and the Koslow family, it is just a battle between the boss and the second child. Even if one family wins, it will not kill the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conference came to an end soon, and there were no nobles to watch, they left in twos and threes, and finally only Master Hudson who stayed here to drink tea was left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, can this really deter the Kingdom of Hesse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The line of defense can be repaired at any time. Before the southern provinces, the two families spent a lot of money to co-direct such a big show, naturally not for the sake of pretending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, relax! You can tell from Minister Hessen's reaction that the meeting just now scared him a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From today, our southeastern province is a united province in the eyes of the outside world. Anyone who wants to attack us must think twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nature is to bully the weak and fear the hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area bordering the Kingdom of Hesse is not just the southeast province. Realizing that we are not easy to mess with, naturally we will not meet head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if war breaks out immediately, they will not list us as the primary breakthrough target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Blood Moon line of defense is made the strongest line of defense in the kingdom and the enemy realizes that the southeast province is difficult to break through, we will be removed from the attack target by the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a large-scale war breaks out in the future, we will still be the rear of the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, in order to obtain a period of peaceful development, he was working hard to make a strategic layout, but the desired effect has not been achieved for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities are reserved for those who are prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden assassination case created an opportunity for him. The Hesse threat theory, which had been preached for many days in the southeastern province, was finally put to use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the previous public opinion base, Hudson successfully fooled a group of nobles in the province, and then used everyone's common consciousness to trick Governor Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    eventually contributed to - \"United Southeast Province\". Believe it or not, Hudson believed it anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is a united province, it is natural that we cannot continue to engage in friction. All kinds of skirmishes in the past must stop now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to keep Governor Pierce busy and have no time to think about it, Hudson not only guided everyone to improve the construction specifications of the Blood Moon Defense Line, but also gave up the initiative in the construction of the Blood Moon Defense Line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the Kingdom of Hesse will come from the Blackstone Mountains in the future, we can only ask the Hessians, anyway, Master Hudson doesn't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy invaded from the Black Rock Mountains, which can prove the foresight of Lord Hudson's proposal to build a defense line; if the enemy does not attack from this side, it means that the strategy of \"surrender without fighting\" has succeeded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the final result is, Master Hudson's judgment is correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the project starts, there is no turning back. Since it was announced in front of so many nobles in the mainland that they would spend huge sums of money to build the Blood Moon defense line, it must be implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It costs a lot, and Lord Hudson doesn't care. The big deal is to destock, instead of piling it up in the warehouse to rust, it is better to take it to a place where it can be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is redundant labor, it can also be exchanged under the banner of coordinating resource allocation to speed up the development and construction of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few years, the construction of the Blood Moon line of defense was completed. The family's swampland has almost been developed, and the first batch of Warcraft cubs have grown up to be ready for official service, and the foundation of the Koslow family is also stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, even if the Dalton family realizes that they have been fooled and wants to take action, it will be too late to curb the development of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King of Hesse, looking at the information sent back from the Kingdom of Alpha, Alexander V asked suspiciously: \"The Alpha people reacted so violently, Count Nicholas, what new military plan has your military affairs department come up with?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to settle accounts with the Alpha Kingdom, but judging from the current situation, they are the one actively preparing for the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the assassination of the prince came back for several days, but the Hesse Kingdom has not yet reached a conclusion on whether to take advantage of the issue to fight against the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are afraid of the Alpha Kingdom, it's mainly because of the current complicated international situation that makes everyone feel uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Testing through diplomatic channels, every big country is hinting at them: Let's do it as much as we want, we promise not to make trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more everyone agitates, the less the Kingdom of Hesse dares to move. Don't look at everyone cheering them on now, if war breaks out, they will immediately turn into another face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to understand the reason, Alexander V could only suspect that his own strategic plan had been leaked, which aroused the high vigilance of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, our Ministry of Military Affairs has not formulated a military plan recently!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Nicholas replied with a confused face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military plan, when it happened, how could he not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the people below are messing around again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's not right either! The bureaucrats in the Ministry of Military Affairs are lazier than the other. Whoever is full has nothing to do and runs to make military plans!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"oh!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not because of you, what is the reason? The Alpha people are like crazy, desperately repairing the defense line on the border, as if we will fight there soon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Alexander V made all the princes and ministers dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They really don't understand the operation of the Alpha Kingdom. They haven't figured out whether to start a tentative war, they are preparing for a full-scale war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that under the current international situation, it is impossible for the Kingdom of Hesse to launch a full-scale war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the data on paper alone, they are indeed much stronger than the Alpha Kingdom now, but they are not the only two countries in the Aslant Continent, and they have to keep people to guard their hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of troops that can really be used in the war is not necessarily more than that of the Alpha Kingdom. After all, the family dominates in the north, and there are not so many countries holding back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Alpha Kingdom must have been frightened by us!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Milton said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the chances of the Alpha people being frightened are not high. The envoy to the Alpha Kingdom sent news that July will announce the responsibility for the assassination, and the Alpha Kingdom is organizing a manpower siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We proposed to redraw the sphere of influence, but the other party didn't even talk about it, so we directly rejected it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the assassination broke out, they have done nothing but send some supplements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously they want us to admit that the assassination was done by the cult in July before conducting in-depth negotiations. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Krasner immediately vetoed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you are scared or not, the problem can be seen most in diplomatic activities. The foreign policy of the Alpha Kingdom has continued to be strong in the past, obviously not because they are afraid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let our people test out their true purpose. Such a big thing can't be explained by a cult!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, strengthen the intelligence collection within the Alpha Kingdom. If the Kingdom wants to move northward, they are our biggest obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to call the governors and sheriffs of the provinces to the capital for a meeting to discuss the strategy for the Alpha Kingdom. This news is released directly, there is no need to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military can't be idle either, dragging the team to wander around the border to put pressure on the Alpha Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Alexander V was really **** off. His own son was assassinated in the Alpha Kingdom, but the other party didn't take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cult organization\", such a rough explanation can also fool children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, 2/3 of the cases that cannot be found out are blamed on cult organizations, and the remaining 1/3 are blamed on foreigners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it weren't for the wrong time, everyone would hold a celebration immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The public celebrations have been cancelled, but there are many private celebrations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the capital of the kingdom, so naturally no one pays attention to such a small problem as \"failure\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that his son landed safely, Hudson didn't stay long, and immediately stepped on the dragon's back and went straight to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Knight's advantages are reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For an ordinary knight to go back and forth to the capital, it would take less than a month to run wildly on horseback, but Maxim could do it in a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the royal capital is tense, and an important person like Hudson cannot be absent, but it is still possible to ask for a day off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a good mood, he found that the atmosphere was not right when he first arrived in the capital. Before he could enter the house, he was invited to discuss matters in the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the nervous crowd, Hudson was very puzzled. I had only left for a day, and something happened again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that another important guest was assassinated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the case, the officials in charge of security work can go home and farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When everyone is here, the meeting will begin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Carles, Count Martinez, tell everyone what happened on your side! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with a serious expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the atmosphere at the scene that, except for him, the guy who left, who didn't know what happened, everyone else knew.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that it must have something to do with the military, otherwise everyone wouldn't be waiting here for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just received the news from the border that the army of the Kingdom of Hesse is gathering in the provinces of Kovasia and Obera.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific target is temporarily unknown, but after analysis, Earl Martinez and I agreed that the Hessians came for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before we left, we also made an emergency plan. The nobles currently staying in the provinces of Kovasia and Obera have already started mobilizing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But only the private armies of nobles in our two provinces may be powerless to resist the enemy's front. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what Count Carles said, Hudson was taken aback, calling it unscientific in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the practice of the continent of Aslante, if a war breaks out between human nations, they must first find a reasonable excuse to do it, and then send someone to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not over yet. After the declaration of war is finished, the war can only be launched after the opponent's army has assembled to the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pay more attention to the rules, the first battle between the two sides will also agree on the time and place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they arrive at the place, they don't start fighting immediately, but the top leaders of both sides conduct the last negotiation, or bickering, and the fight officially starts when they can't reach an agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can successfully persuade the other party, or if one party is subdued, it is common to withdraw troops and go home directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The kingdom's standing army has already set out and will arrive at the front line in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I invite everyone to come here to discuss whether the Hessians want to start a war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If war breaks out, how should the kingdom deal with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several powerful countries in the central region are all eyeing our northern continent, will they take advantage of the fire?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war expands, which enemies do we need to face, and which allies can we win? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The series of questions raised by Caesar IV completely confused Hudson. Is this discussing how to deal with it? It is clear that they have already started to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces on the border began to be fully mobilized, and the kingdom's standing army was also deployed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is the Alpha Kingdom. In the past, when the orc army made a slight move, this is how everyone responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of years of habits have become natural, and now everyone is driven by instinct in the subconscious. This good habit will definitely not change for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very suspicious. The army of the Alpha Kingdom has completed its assembly, and the Hessians are still discussing whether to launch a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, perhaps the situation is not that bad. The standing army of the Hessians is only 230,000 people, and at most half of them can be devoted to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how elite they are, with only such a small force in total, let the nobles from all over the country defend their castles and fortresses, they may not even be able to take down the provinces of Kovasia and Obera.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to invade the kingdom, you must mobilize the whole country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    May wish to see their follow-up actions before deciding whether to carry out national mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is in the recovery period, and it is not suitable for launching a large-scale war. It is best not to fight if it is possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the more he talked, the more he felt that something was wrong. Who is the representative of the Kingdom's hawk faction!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How did he, the biggest main combat faction, become the leader of the anti-war faction?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Earl of Hudson is right. The Hessians are no more warlike than the orcs. They haven't fought a war with more than 200,000 people in the past eighty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the current mobilization of troops is just a temptation, and their envoys have not withdrawn yet! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado hurriedly followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Finance is the largest anti-war faction in the Alpha Kingdom. However, due to his limited military ability, Marquis Delgado did not dare to draw conclusions easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that Hudson, the military master of the kingdom, speaks, Marquis Delgado's heart immediately has a bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can not fight, then you must not fight. If the kingdom's reaction is too extreme and the flames of war are ignited all at once, the finances will really be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the war is won, it will be another situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, considering the obvious strengths of both sides, everyone still has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the number of standing armies of the two countries is almost the same, but the Warcraft Cavalry in the Hessian Kingdom Army has become an organizational system, and its weapons and equipment are more advanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disparity in the strength of the noble private armies between the two countries is even greater. Most of the elite private army of the Alpha Kingdom were buried on the battlefield of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How strong is the combat power, I am afraid no one can tell. Anyway, the aristocratic gentlemen present have no confidence in these troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the noble private army of the Kingdom of Hesse is superior in both quantity and quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength gap between the extraordinary military services is even greater. In the Kingdom of Hesse, if a family does not have hundreds of monster cavalry, they are ashamed to call themselves a great nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also large and small magician groups, the specific strength is not clear, anyway, the worst magician group is stronger than Hudson's pocket mage group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Alpha Kingdom is not without advantages. The speed of mobilization is one aspect. The key is that ninety-nine percent of the nobles on the kingdom's side came off the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The various domestic armies are generally inferior to the Hesse Kingdom in individual strength, but these people are all veterans who have just come off the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the confidence that Hudson dared to assert that, in the case of defending the city, the small mobile force of the Kingdom of Hesse could not win the confidence of the two provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't achieve phased victory in a short period of time, you will fall into a strategic stalemate. Once the crowd tactics were started, the advantages of the Hesse Kingdom's elite soldiers were not obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continent of Aslant is not peaceful, and the strength of the human race cannot be consumed indefinitely in the civil war. At that time, some countries will come out to persuade them to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for a period of peaceful development to stabilize his own foundation, Hudson really wouldn't mind pushing the boat along the way and fighting against the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, foreign wars can really divert domestic conflicts. Instead of letting the nobles of the kingdom fight endlessly, it is better to lead everyone to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning or losing is not important. According to the current gameplay, the expansion of the human race's internal fighting is mainly based on encroachment, and the country will be destroyed before a single battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Delgado, the Kingdom of Hesse has summoned nobles from all over the country to the capital for a meeting, which is a sign of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the saying goes, be prepared, the kingdom must prepare for war in advance, and cannot be attacked by the enemy because of momentary negligence...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words were almost finished before Count Martinez realized something was wrong. It seems that there is no precedent for a direct sneak attack in the war between the nations of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But on the surface, he still maintained his composure. It's not impossible to use precedents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war really broke out, no one knows whether the enemy will obey the rules. Naturally, predictions about things that have not yet happened cannot be defined by right or wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knows that his judgment is too subjective, he must persist. This is the way of survival of the border nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Placing anyone in his position will require the kingdom to prepare for the war with all its strength, so as not to suffer losses when the war breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to engage in a big wave of pushback as soon as the war breaks out, and place the battlefield within the enemy's borders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Martinez, things are not that bad. You are all guarding the city now, and even if the enemy sneak attack, it will be difficult to achieve much results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Hessians are not that crazy to lose the reputation of the country for just a few castles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that our relationship with the Kingdom of Hesse has only deteriorated in the past year, and there is no inextricable hatred between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they really can't bear it and want to launch a war abroad, we can draw disaster from outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, acquiescing to the Kingdom of Hesse's invasion of one or two small northern countries would be a good choice. Since they want to move closer to the big countries in the central region, they should be fulfilled. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the words of the Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, Hudson called out in his heart: Good guy, isn't this a replica of the policy of appeasement?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom plays like this, it will be the source of disaster. When the ambitions of the Hessians are stimulated, a full-scale war between the two countries will really be inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is knowing, but Hudson did not jump out to object. What does the life and death of several small northern countries have to do with him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the gameplay of the Aslant continent, even if the Kingdom of Hesse is allowed to expand to the northern continent, their pace will not be fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to successfully annex a country, even the smallest uncle country, you have to go through all the political, military, and diplomatic means, and you have to face the interference of many powerful countries\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the method is a little too extreme, he will be surrounded by people, and his parents will not recognize him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right. Now that the international situation has changed, our foreign policy should also change accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, several major powers in the central region want to advance northward. With the current state of the kingdom, it is really too difficult to stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to make some appropriate concessions, sacrifice the interests of those fools, and temporarily stabilize them. Buy enough time for the kingdom to recover. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the Marquis Zuell further clarified the policy of appeasement. Everything stems from interests. The southeastern provinces have national defense pressure, and the southwestern provinces are also not easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is busy recovering their strength, and now all the nobles in the kingdom don't want to start a war at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counts Carles and Martinez, who were clamoring originally, also fell silent at this moment. Obviously, they also don't want to break out of war with the Kingdom of Hesse at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a chance to lure the enemy away, who wants to turn their own territory into a battlefield?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Zuel, the enemy's ambition cannot be fed by a little profit. The more we indulge them, the greater their ambition will be, and sooner or later they will come back to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps when the time comes, our enemy will not be just a Hesse Kingdom, but multiple kingdoms in the middle part ruled by desire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is to fight out now, and use iron and fire to extinguish the enemy's ambitions, instead of luring them to annex other small countries! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero hurriedly objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed at which the main combat faction was defeated was so fast that he didn't even bother to struggle, forcing him to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the policy of appeasement is passed, the war will definitely not be fought for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Hessians are not in the water, they will know to bully the neighboring small country to eat meat, instead of running to fight against the iron plate of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the development of the situation, all the nobles in the country are as they wished, but the nobles of the Northland are the only ones who have suffered a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Peaceful times are slowly developing, and the military advantage that originally belonged to the nobles of the North will soon be overtaken by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some wealthy nobles may even rely on their own strong financial resources to surpass them militarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Hiro, if you can solve the kingdom's financial problems and find a way to make up for the gap in military strength between the two sides, I think this suggestion is very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can't be done, I don't think your suggestion is feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, war is about logistics. With the kingdom's current financial resources, I'm afraid we will run out of money just after the war begins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy this time is not a foreign race, so don't expect the Human Race Alliance to give us the bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your Excellency can guarantee that the Kingdom's military can continue to fight for the Kingdom when the supply of logistical supplies is not available, then forget it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado's words choked Duke Hero to death, and the other four Dukes were also livid with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of the army's inferior combat effectiveness can still be overcome. The big deal is to use veterans to heap elite soldiers to death. With everyone's rich combat experience, there may not be no chance of winning on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reason of \"there is no money, and the supply of strategic materials cannot be supplied\" is really an unsolvable problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the financial situation of the Alpha Kingdom, not to mention going out to borrow money, and not being called in advance, it is considered as a face by the creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Francis, according to everyone's proposal just now, is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs able to settle the Kingdom of Hesse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The national policy meeting had just ended, and the nobles from the two provinces of Kovacia and Oberla rushed back to the fief overnight to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the war can be fought or not, it must be right to make sufficient preparations first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that Caesar IV's luck is still very good. Everyone's attention was drawn to the southeast crisis, and they had no intention of continuing to test him, the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the two provinces were absent, and the progress of the next meeting also accelerated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some unimportant small problems, everyone is too lazy to tangle. The nobles who originally wanted to make trouble with the repayment tax also chose to be silent at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be the crisis in the two provinces of Kovacia and Oberla, but in fact the entire southern land is shrouded in the shadow of war, at least the nobles in the southern provinces think so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southern aristocrats are not in the mood to toss, the emerging aristocrats have no confidence to toss, and the northern aristocrats have just been wooed by Caesar IV, so it is not good to slap the boss in the face immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the kingdom's relaxation of its suppression of the northern nobles, the theme of this meeting almost all revolved around war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the main combat faction, Hudson naturally advocated the theory of the threat of the three central kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Operation is domineering. In order to ease the internal struggle of the kingdom, Hudson also worked hard, throwing out three potential enemies at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the three kingdoms in the middle of the country are only directly bordered by the Kingdom of Hesse and Alpha, it does not affect his theory of the threat of the Three Kingdoms in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance persuasiveness, Hudson comprehensively analyzed the reasons for the invasion of Alpha by the three central kingdoms from three aspects: politics, economy, and military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were placed in other countries, this theory would be bragging, and few people would believe it. However, in the Alpha Kingdom, it has won the support of a lot of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. Hudson did not take the kingdom's own security as the starting point, but instead talked about the strategic security of the three major kingdoms in the central region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three central kingdoms are located in the center of the mainland. They seem to have a superior geographical location, but strategically they face the threat of a pincer attack from the north and the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't take advantage of the decline of the major northern countries and move northward, and wait for them to recover, the good days of the three central kingdoms will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"\"North and South Join Forces to Carve up the Central Continent\", \"The Road to the Growth of the Southern Powers\", \"Strategy for the Rise of the Northern Powers\"...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of things that no one thought about, were thrown out by Hudson directly. It's as if the countries in the North and South have reached an agreement to carve up the central part of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To sum it up in one sentence: The three central kingdoms are very dangerous strategically, and if they want to get rid of their own dangers, the only way to go north is to defeat the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the end of the conference, not only the nobles of the southern provinces were frightened, but even the northern nobles who were eager to try were frightened by the self-substitution brain supplement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no confidence in a Hesse Kingdom. If the three central kingdoms come together, it will be a stronger combination than the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the three kingdoms in the central region will invade the north, anyway, after taking their own roles, everyone believes that if they are in the position of the rulers of the three kingdoms in the central region, they will definitely promote the northward strategy to reverse the strategic dilemma.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the alpha mode of thinking with an over-conscious sense of crisis, what everyone considers is no longer whether there is a threat to the three central kingdoms, but when they will invade the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Threats uttered by others, no matter how terrifying the descriptions are, are not as scary as the threats made up by oneself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's like the legendary catastrophe of ten thousand years. Everyone knows about it, but few people are really afraid of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the time is too far away, and the relevant written materials have been destroyed in the flames of war. The few words that have been handed down are similar to myths and legends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no eternal power, even the old nobles who claim to have been passed down for tens of thousands of years, in fact, only have an ancient surname left, and I don't know how many times they have been destroyed in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the ancestors at the source were all recognized halfway because of political needs, and there is no blood relationship between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He believed that the three major kingdoms in the central region would invade the north, and many things that happened now were interpreted in depth with conspiracy theories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the meeting hastily ended, everyone rushed back to prepare for the battle. The nobles in the southeastern province are no exception. The most discussed topic along the way is: how to improve the Blood Moon line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, but everyone thinks that the defense of the Blackstone Mountains is not enough, and the Hessian army can also fight from neighboring provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some nobles with good relations even started to discuss the issue of joint defense. The same family, whose territory is relatively close, is planning to join forces to build a castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people are proud, while others are frustrated. Looking at the heated discussions among the crowd, the careerists can only sigh deep in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity for a big merger just slipped away. Once the little nobles are in a group, they can't annex them if they want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding five people may not be able to connect with the whole world, but when five nobles gather together, they can get in touch with most of the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hurry up and return to the territory. Hudson felt relieved when he picked up his son who was just born a few days ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a big fool is also very laborious. Especially to fool a group of old foxes, the difficulty is +1008...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, Hudson still suspects that someone has seen through his plan, but chose to shut up for his own benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few careerists, most nobles do not want to see the kingdom fall into endless internal strife. Especially the royal family is worried about the escalation of internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the process of Hudson fooling everyone, the prime minister and the minister of military affairs who came from the royal family came out together to help the situation. Even among the great nobles, half of them have spoken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either guide intentionally, or hit from the side. Even if they came out to sing against the stage, there was no shortage of water during the debate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many smart people, and Hudson is also very helpless. It wasn't until I got home that my tense nerves were relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, be careful! You are so careless, in case you hurt little Franz...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Melissa's complaint, Hudson's eyes immediately became bitter. His family status was -1 when his son was just born, and it would be fine if he had more children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Melissa. I'm a good magician, I'll be fine. See how happy little Franz is smiling?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cowhide was blowing very loudly, but my son didn't give me face. As soon as he finished speaking, Franz's smiling face disappeared, followed by a burst of crying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Melissa directly snatched her son from Hudson, never giving him a chance to play with him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is even more exasperating is that little Franz is in the hands of Melissa, and the cute smiling face has returned, which makes Hudson feel miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has decided to develop papermaking and prepare a few more homework for Franz, so that he can know the dangers of society in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse, seeing the overreaction of the Alpha Kingdom, Alexander V didn't know how to end it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standing army wandered around the border, and they were mobilized directly, making the border situation extremely tense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue that needs to be considered now is not only whether to call, but also whether others will call.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the forest is big, there are all kinds of birds, and when there are more nobles, all kinds of strange flowers will appear. Because of a few fools, a war was triggered, and too many things happened in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Claude wrote to me, stating the pros and cons of various aspects, and expressing his opposition to provoking war. What do you think?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is still very satisfied with this son. Ordinary people would panic when they encountered such a thing, but Claude was able to deal with it rationally and not be swayed by emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Claude is not the eldest son, otherwise the next generation of Hesse Kingdom would be guaranteed. Of course, the boss is also pretty good, except for a little too much ambition, there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young people, it is normal to be arrogant. When you get older and your mentality slowly calms down, it will be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Your Highness is very insightful, and his analysis of the problem is very pertinent. The Alpha Kingdom is a quagmire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reaction of the nobles in their country, you can tell that these guys are completely born for war, and they don't understand politics at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that they have been fighting with orcs all year round, and they have beaten their heads stupidly. When encountering problems, the first thing that comes to mind is war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't need to argue with these lunatics, we lost our figure for nothing! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Milton said pretending to be disdainful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he kept praying that the king would listen to his advice and not jump into the quagmire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the prime minister is right. Now the Alpha Kingdom is just a puddle of mud. \"It won't stick to the wall, and it will stick to people.\" No matter who touches it, it will get dirty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refer to the previous orc invasions, and you will know how stubborn the Alpha people are. Even the lowest level of serfs can fight the orcs to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a country, even if we defeat them, it will be difficult to gain much benefit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer Baxtero echoed with a face of approval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The facts are in front of our eyes, the Alpha Kingdom is heavily in debt, and once defeated, the finances will immediately collapse, and the war reparations will definitely not be received.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ceding territory, even if the Alpha people are willing to agree, other powerful countries on the mainland will intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the diplomatic skills are full, they will take away one or two counties at most. It is impossible to have more, otherwise, if you eat it, you will have to spit it out in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No country is willing to see the Kingdom of Hesse grow bigger. Expansion beyond the bottom line of everyone's heart is to force people to encircle them. This is determined by the location of the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone encourages them to do something, not to watch them expand, but to use their hands to probe the bottom of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war, the third largest military power in the mainland was not a name that was blown out, but was killed through war after war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, there was a threat of orcs, but everyone was not too worried. Now that this threat is eliminated, all countries have to raise the development ceiling of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in terms of territorial area and development potential, the Alpha Kingdom is the top in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after regaining the seven provinces in the north, the territory area even surpassed the Frankish Kingdom, ranking first on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally the most powerful country in the Northern Continent. If it regains its vitality and develops with great concentration for a few decades, there is hope of catching up with the Frankish Kingdom, which is the number one in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely because of seeing this that Alexander V felt in a dilemma.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, he doesn't want to see the Alpha Kingdom grow bigger; on the other hand, he doesn't want to be a **** for others and make enemies for the Hesse Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let's try diplomatic means first! I met with Minister Alpha last night, and his attitude is obviously different from before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of trials, I found that their national policy is undergoing a major change, and it seems that they are going to shrink their strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I mentioned a word by the way, asking them to admit that the Counties of Colombia are our vassals. I thought he would strongly oppose it, but I didn't expect him to just condemn it symbolically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That feeling, as if we give them a certain amount of compensation, we will acquiesce in annexing the Counties of Colombia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is also possible that the Alpha people are in urgent need of blood recovery and want to carve up the Counties of Colombia with us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Krasner's words made Alexander V's eyes shine. Compared with challenging big guys, bullying small countries is obviously easier to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Count Colombia speaks nicely, there are constant gifts throughout the year, but it is still nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past hundreds of years, it has been swinging left and right. For a while, he followed them, and for a while he fell to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of younger brother who lacks loyalty, Alexander V does not think that they are also his own. As long as they get the support of the Alpha Kingdom, it is only a matter of time before they annex the Counties of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific operation is very simple, just keep looking for excuses to create disputes, cut a town today, cut a city tomorrow, and slowly eat away and annex it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let's try, but acquiescence is not enough, we must also win the support of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is to join hands to carve up the Counties of Colombia, or to give them a certain amount of compensation, you can discuss it slowly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who knows him knows that his king is tempted. The country of Colombia is not that big, with an area of ​​only 50,000 square kilometers and a population of less than one million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is precisely because the country is small that it is easy to annex. A guy as big as the Alpha Kingdom would not be able to swallow it in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A slight increase in appetite will cause a chain reaction and provoke the intervention of countries in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if you want to plot against the Counties of Korubia, then the troops we put on the border should withdraw ten miles one after another!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has been a confrontation there, and accidents are prone to happen. By the way, you can also use the withdrawal to express goodwill to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the conflicts between us and the Alpha Kingdom are all caused by Count Korubia. With this problem solved, the rest will be easy to talk about! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Nicholas said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that he is really happy. Compared to attacking the Alpha Kingdom, it is obviously more certain to invade the Counties of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former has to work hard, but the latter is lying down and taking credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ten miles back is still too close to show sincerity, and the army will be ordered to retreat 30 miles. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will take care of the rest!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the matter can be negotiated, then let the Alpha people issue a new investigation report on the assassination case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The July Society of the Cult is only the specific executor of the assassination case, but the mastermind behind all this is the Count of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose is to provoke a war between us and the Alpha Kingdom, so that we can benefit from it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the specific details, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Alpha people will discuss and compile it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more he talked, the more he felt that it was outrageous. Alexander V himself felt a little embarrassed for such an obvious frame-up.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

When the time comes for concrete implementation, on-the-spot exploration is still required.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Governor Pierce is bringing a group of nobles in the province to visit the site in person for a field inspection. Basically, the nobles who are active are here today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the defense lines of other provinces, which require the help of other provinces to build, the Blood Moon Defense Line planned by the Southeast Province is all self-financed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The corresponding autonomy is also the highest. Whether it is the site selection of the defense line or the construction design, everything is decided by the southeast province itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spend your own money and protect your own territory, no matter how cautious you are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A dragon roar came, and everyone's eyes were attracted. Although this is not the first time everyone has seen it, the shocking appearance of the giant dragon still caused a sensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce frowned slightly, and was about to say something, but swallowed the words again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Knight's card is so big, it cannot be compared with other monsters. Even if the strength is not weaker than the giant dragon, the influence it brings is far less than that of the giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a giant dragon to help you expand your influence, so it is not for nothing. It seems to be pretending, but it is actually instilling in everyone's minds the concept that Master Hudson is very powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keep a low profile, that's the way old nobles play. The emerging aristocrats must show their edge and continuously spread their influence in order to be able to recruit talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, as a dragon knight, Hudson has long been famous in the mainland. He is the focus no matter where he goes, and he can't keep a low profile at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is here, let's start!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Governor Pierce followed the guide who led the way and walked directly to the forefront of the team, showing with practical actions that he is the leader of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson just smiled lightly, and didn't mean to compete with him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being the boss can get the biggest cake, but he also has to bear corresponding obligations, and messy things are definitely inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Presiding over the construction of the Blood Moon Defense Line seems to be a high-ranking authority with sufficient oil and water, but it is related to the life and death of the Dalton family. Does Governor Pierce dare to tamper with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire southeastern province is flat, and the one that can barely be considered a natural danger is the Salam Mountains in the Hudson Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Hessians come in, the Koslow family can still abandon Wright County and retreat to the swamp behind the Salam Mountains to continue to hold on, while the Dalton family will only be left with a bunch of castles on the plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone helped to work for nothing, and Hudson was too happy, so how could he jump out and fight for this drudgery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking all the way along the Blackstone Mountains, Hudson's expression gradually became dignified. The terrain in this area is not as dangerous as he imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that they could use the terrain to build a fortress on the hilltop at the edge of the Black Rock Mountain Range, but when they got there, they realized that it was just a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountains on both sides are very steep, but the forest in the narrowest area in the middle suddenly becomes low, looking like a corridor sandwiched in the mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this corridor is a bit special, with a length and width of nearly a hundred kilometers. With a little modification, it is a square.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to talk about a flat river, but the undulating **** of the “square” in the middle is really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the proposed construction of the Blood Moon Line of Defense went so smoothly. Emotional Governor Pierce has long known that the terrain here is flat and can be passed by large troops. Fortifications must be built to block the enemy's front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there are at least three lines of defense here. In addition to the front line of defense, the defenses of the two wings and the back must also be strengthened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Warcraft Legion of the Kingdom of Hesse has been established, and there are thousands of Warcraft knights in the standing army on the bright side. If the noble private army is added, the number can be doubled several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If war breaks out, the enemy gathers thousands of monster knights to borrow from the Blackstone Mountains and attack us from different directions in a detour, which is completely feasible militarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the defense line, beacon towers must also be erected along the Blackstone Mountains to guard against enemy sneak attacks. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you proposed to build the Blood Moon Line of Defense before, it was just to buy time for your own peaceful development, but now it is really to prevent the enemy from invading here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cayo, record all the opinions of Earl Hudson and list them as a prerequisite for later construction.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce ordered straightforwardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is about the safety of his own family, and he dare not be arrogant about it. If the consideration is not comprehensive and something goes wrong later, it will be fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson made a good start, and more nobles made subsequent comments. Governor Pierce ordered Viscount Cayo to record it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is: the opinions put forward by Hudson are directly included in the necessary elements for later implementation; while other people's proposals need to be discussed and discussed later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    obviously treated differently, but no one expressed objection, as if everything was taken for granted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the expressions of everyone, Hudson also found that everyone wished that he would put forward a hundred and eighty opinions at once to plug all the loopholes in the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was a disagreement, it was finally implemented according to Hudson's opinion, and there was not even a decent debate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the southeastern province had more confidence in him than Hudson himself, almost reaching the point of blind obedience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is also possible that this group of nobles who came down from the battlefield are too self-aware and have no confidence in their own abilities, so they pin their hopes on Hudson, the \"famous general\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since everyone trusts themselves so much, Hudson will naturally not be a scam. He doesn't care about the specific construction, anyway, it's right to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the serfs are unable to complete the project content, let the knights and magicians do it. Although it is not in line with everyone's honorable status, this is also an old tradition of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the construction of a series of important defense lines in the Northland, there are many nobles who personally participated. Some are not up to the technical level and must use extraordinary means; some are in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing and tossing for more than half a month, a preliminary plan for the construction of the defense line finally appeared in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't look carefully, you may think it is copying the defense line of Blood Moon Castle in Northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the construction specifications of the defense line or the technical standards, the two can only be said to be exactly the same. The only difference is that the Blood Moon defense line in the southeastern province is much shorter than the Blood Moon Castle defense line in the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. The two blood moon defense lines, one south and one north, were planned according to the will of Master Hudson. It is difficult to imagine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is worth mentioning that the blood moon defense line in northern Xinjiang is unfinished. Without the threat of orcs, the impoverished Alpha Kingdom has no motivation to continue investing huge sums of money in construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the winter of 99991, the Alpha Kingdom was extremely lively. Nobles from all over the world are either building defense lines, training troops in their territories, or even doing both at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that human potential is forced out. As long as noble gentlemen make up their minds to do it, the explosive energy will be amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except that the daily expenses were a little more frugal, everyone's life was still the same, but the serfs below suffered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought I could take a break in winter, but I didn't expect that my aristocrats would be tossing endlessly, either sending them to the construction site or taking everyone to military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While everyone was working hard, the international situation suddenly took a shocking turn. The Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Hesse, which had a strong smell of gunpowder and were ready to fight at any time, suddenly stood together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foreign ministries of the two countries jointly announced that the latest investigation report on the assassination of Prince Claude was directed at the Countess of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the diplomatic note in his hand, Louis Vuitton III was stunned. After confirming the above content with the envoy again and again, he fainted on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the monarch fainted, but most of the princes and ministers present also fainted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few sober people were also terribly frightened. In a panic, I don't know how to deal with it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a small country, the Counties of Korubia were able to become independent after the split of the Guangming Empire and continue to inherit until now, so naturally they also have unique features.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being independent in the early years is because the ancestors can fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Guangming Empire collapsed, Count Corubia was also one of the princes, and he was still a powerful prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the political reaction was relatively slow. When he realized that the division of the empire was inevitable, the neighbors all completed the first round of grouping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The proud and arrogant Earl Corubia was unwilling to be subordinated to others, and when the split occurred, he simply became independent and played by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many small countries that are independent together, and the Counties of Korubia are not inconspicuous among them. In addition, the Aslante Continent paid more attention to rules than it does now. Even if a war starts, everyone will only use the same force, and will not rely on more soldiers to bully others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the impressive family strength, the Earl of Corubia also made a name for himself in the fight, and the Count of Corubia was successfully established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Later, the orc invasion war broke out, and some small countries that realized that they could not protect themselves began to merge, and the Alpha Kingdom, the Moxi Principality, and the Warhammer Kingdom appeared one after another...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Count of Corubia was also invited, but he refused, which opened the history of the Counties of Corubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time goes by, everyone's bottom line is constantly being lowered, and the countenance of Cuba, which is sandwiched between the two big countries, is not so easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they are good at assessing the situation. When the Alpha Kingdom was strong, it was attached to the Alpha Kingdom; when the Hesse Kingdom was strong, it followed Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While swaying from side to side, they are also very good at being human. Gifts are constantly being sent out throughout the year, and the relationship with the dignitaries of the two countries is good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how good the relationship is, it still can't resist the temptation of benefits. The sudden diplomatic note almost announced the end of the Counties of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Manipulating the cult in July, sending people to assassinate Prince Claude, in an attempt to provoke a war between the Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Hesse\", such a crime is not something that the Count of Korubia can bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hand over the murderer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that they have to have a murderer first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't do anything, didn't know anything, the scapegoat was directly thrown at him, without even a chance to explain, it was obviously aimed at the foundation of the Count of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, Louis Vuitton III, who woke up from a coma, looked at the retainers guarding the bed and said slowly: \"Judging from the contents of the note, the Hessians and the Alpha Kingdom have reached an agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this catastrophe, Bo Guo probably won't be able to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Edmonton, you immediately select 300 elite soldiers to **** the prince and princess to the Kingdom of Iberia...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, we didn't do this. The Kingdom of Hesse and the Kingdom of Alpha want to send people to investigate, so let them investigate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can invite the ministers of various countries in the mainland to supervise together. In front of everyone, they can't fabricate evidence out of thin air and frame it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Edmonton said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really too bullying. They didn't do anything, and a black pot fell from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hmph, evidence!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The present continent is no longer the former continent. Since we received this note, the charges have been confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They say we did it, so we did it. Everyone cooperates to perform the trick together, and can still leave a bit of dignity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we pierce the window paper and tear off their camouflage, I am afraid that even the last decency will not be left for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, what they want is the country of Columbia. No matter how many charges are charged on my head, it won't hurt me at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Few people would dare to bear the charge of regicide!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There you go, Edmonton. You take people to **** the prince and princess away immediately, and come back after the storm is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no accidents, the royal family should be able to leave a small piece of land to show their...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Thinking of the diplomatic notes jointly issued by the two countries, Hudson knew that his king had started to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV was not a law-abiding lord after all. He had only been enthroned for a few days, and he couldn't bear it anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Busy, definitely not for nothing. Just one failed prince assassination case is not enough to make the Alpha Kingdom pay such a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jointly issue a diplomatic note, and jointly play with planting and framing, and most likely there will be no lack of joint spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carving up the Counties of Colombia, the kingdom can indeed take advantage of it in the short term, but once the precedent of blatantly framing is set, there will be endless troubles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse did that, and Hudson could still express his understanding. In the land of the Four Wars, catching up with this great era of hundreds of boats vying for the crossing, if you don't work hard to expand your strength, sooner or later you will be the meat on the chopping board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the human race is inversely proportional to the binding force of the rules. The faster the racial strength increases, the less attention everyone pays to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire was crippled, and the human race occupied the orc prairie. The major alien races only came forward to mediate, and did not send troops to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, Hudson thought that the orcs were too hostile, and the human race did a good job in diplomacy, which contributed to this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As his status grew and his understanding of the situation on the mainland deepened, Hudson discovered that this was not the case at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of racial survival, very few races will be impulsive because of past hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the continuous expansion of the human race, without taking action to intervene, would be tantamount to slow suicide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is that after hundreds of years of continuous suppression, the living space of all ethnic groups in the mainland has been severely squeezed. In the past few decades, the comprehensive strength of many races has declined instead of rising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Orc Empire sent a signal for help, various tribes also wanted to send troops to intervene, but limited by their own strength, they were beyond the reach of the war that took place in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the combined strength of all the alien races on the continent of Aslante is still above the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this is only strength on paper. There are also many conflicts among the major alien races. They lack sufficient trust with each other, and it is impossible to achieve close cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, they are still divided in various parts of the continent by the various countries of the human race. Even if they can really unite, they will not be able to gather for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's to save the orcs, start a war in haste. A group of alien races scattered all over the mainland will not only not be able to take advantage of it, but will also fall into the embarrassing situation of fighting on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, there is a high probability that they will be defeated one by one by the concentrated forces of various countries of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orc empire was crippled, the human race, which originally had a strategic advantage, had an even more obvious advantage over the various races in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, the crisis awareness of a group of high-level people has also declined. Everyone is becoming less and less concerned about the threat of alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the threat of foreign enemies, everyone's minds became active, but they still retained a certain moral bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV's operation this time undoubtedly dragged down everyone's little integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two countries successfully carve up the Counties of Colombia, then there will be more people following the example. A new round of merger frenzy can be said to be imminent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on the ambitions of those in power in several major countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the ambition is big, then you can condemn it with your mouth, and secretly fuel the flames, and try your best to promote the annexation of Korubia by the two countries, laying the foundation for their next expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have much ambition, then decisively intervene to maintain the current status quo as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was very helpless about this uncontrollable change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules are the most unbearable thing. Today you break one, tomorrow I break one, and the day after tomorrow no one cares about the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules are gradually losing their effectiveness, and everyone's moral bottom line is constantly being lowered. In the end, the \"transition from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States Period\" is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this trend is not curbed, the next continent of Aslant will become more and more difficult to mix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    wanted to stop it, but the pen was in his hand, and Hudson put it down again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Diplomatic notes have been sent out, even if the Alpha Kingdom stops now, the bad political impact brought about has already happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, Caesar IV is not a person who likes to be persuaded. A group of princes and ministers in the capital can't stop him. Hudson doesn't believe that a letter of his own can play a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing in the direction of the royal capital, Hudson couldn't help sighing: \"The political reputation that His Majesty Caesar III worked so hard to lose!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Paused for a while, Hudson was relieved, and wrote again. It's just that this letter was not addressed to Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to deliver this letter to Mr. Jose, and let our people in the capital do a good job of responding.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't persuade your own king, then just wave a **** to dig the wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Caesar IV succeeded to the throne, in order to win people's hearts, a large-scale nobility canonization has been held, and all the ceremonies that were too late to be performed before were made up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, among the many conferees, Jose could not be found. The court earl who took the blame for the crown prince seemed to be forgotten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other people's forgetting may be due to the manager's mistake. If the people who followed the royal family were forgotten, that would be unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Caesar IV forgot in a hurry, someone around him would come out to remind him. Having been in the royal family for so many years, it is impossible for Jose to not even have a friend who can help him speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, he is also a \"hero\" who helped take the blame. Now that Caesar IV is on the throne, there should be proper care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that after waiting for such a long time, Caesar IV did nothing, and he never even summoned Jose in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Caesar IV wanted to erase his dark history too much. He didn't know how to face Jose who had witnessed the whole history, so he simply chose to deal with it coldly and use time to dilute everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were not too many insiders, Jose might have been silenced. In order to protect their reputation, the superiors will do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Caesar IV doesn't care, then Hudson is not welcome. He has long been envious of the royal family's talent pool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to be able to dig people over, Hudson also made a lot of preparations, and now it is finally time to harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Frankish Kingdom, Charles III, who received the news, was shocked at first, and then overjoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the number one kingdom in the mainland, its prestige is certainly prestige, but it has been at the forefront for a long time, and it is impossible to do anything out of the ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously sitting on a huge military strength, but can only bully the surrounding aliens. Any small movement within the human race will be deeply interpreted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the alien race bordering the Frankish Kingdom had long been driven to the barren land, and there was not much money to be made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to break the situation on the mainland, Charles III also made a series of strategic arrangements, the biggest of which was to pull the mainland countries to defeat the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that his judgment is not wrong. After the threat of alien races decreased, the balance within the human race was also broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Kingdom of Hesse and the Kingdom of Alpha are taking the lead in breaking the rules of the game, and the shackles that originally bound the Frankish Kingdom have become loose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III had a premonition that as long as the Counties of Colombia were partitioned, the current political philosophy pursued by the nations of the human race would definitely be impacted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone abandoned the moral code and began to expand wantonly, the power of the rules that restrained the Frankish Kingdom ceased to exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a chaotic game without rules, everyone fights for strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think of the actions of the Hessians and Alphas?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this will be the beginning of chaos in the mainland. After so many years in Taiping, many people have long been impatient and want to fight a big fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the Holy See as an example. In recent years, one after another has been doing things in order to provoke a continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that this kind of thing happened, Pius VII will definitely add fuel to the flames and add fuel to the chaos in the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Corubia is partitioned, the reality of the Alpha Kingdom will be exposed, and everyone knows that their determination to block the northward advance of the central powers is not strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of South Bank, which have long been ready to move, will not watch the Hessians eat meat, and will definitely follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the next unlucky ones will be the turn of Grint and Nadal, the two sloppy countries. Alpha people will not turn against two big countries for two traitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi has limited strength and has no ability to send troops to intervene; the Kingdom of Warhammer is still busy with the civil war. When they finish fighting, it is estimated that the number of countries in the North will be reduced by half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if we take the lead in intervening, we can also make them do nothing. But this is not in the interests of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shift of the strategic center of gravity of the three central kingdoms to the north is also a good thing for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Oprus next door has been in decline for a long time, and it was a gift from the Lord of Dawn to the kingdom. Now there is only one opportunity left! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Bergson said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other countries, Hesse and Alpha are still carefully plotting a 50,000-square-kilometer counties. The Franks, who are standing still, have already set their sights on the vast Kingdom of Oprus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the two sides is obviously not on the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Oprus has also been glorious in history. Even if it is in decline now, relying on the strong family background left by the ancestors, it can still be squeezed into the list of the top ten kingdoms in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the glory is only the past after all. With the rise of the Frankish Kingdom, their hard days began.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past hundred years, seven wars broke out between the two sides, and the Kingdom of Oprus lost all of them. And in three of them, the entire army was wiped out, leaving only the underpants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the family background is, it cannot withstand such a toss. After successive defeats, the decline of the Oprus Kingdom is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Land cession and compensation can only be regarded as trivial matters. Under the constraints of the rules, they have been defeated seven times and lost more than half of the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The backbone of a country is broken, and it will be too difficult to bring it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consecutive generations of Oprus kings wanted to reverse the decadent situation of the kingdom, and adopted a series of political reforms for this purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is too much internal resistance, and a good neighbor next door comes here from time to time to add to the chaos. Under internal and external troubles, the more reforms they carry out, the faster they will decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right. Now the big forces on the mainland can't stand it anymore, and there is only one fuse missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, before proceeding to annex the Kingdom of Oprus, my personal suggestion is to clear the surrounding alien races first, and kill hidden dangers in the cradle in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce political pressure, we can also pull the Kingdom of Iberia to act together. They have been eyeing the declining Avalat Kingdom for a long time, and there is only one opportunity to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If necessary, we can also encourage the Holy See to invade the Kingdom of Ruthenia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that once the flames of war ignite, it will surely affect the entire continent. At that time, not only our human race countries will be involved in the fight, but also the major foreign races will be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the time, it is estimated that when the mainland fell into chaos, it would be almost ten thousand years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is the most taboo of the ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know if it's a coincidence, or if there is a mysterious force pushing it deliberately. Every ten thousand years, the continent of Aslante will be in chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the time is too long, and the remaining materials are only a few words, and it is impossible to restore the historical truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the kingdom has excavated many ruins, the understanding of the previous era is still very limited! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exclamation of Marquis **** directly affected everyone's emotions. Almost all the ancient ruins and great powers that have been passed down for a long time have records about the \"Ten Thousand Years Calamity\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But everyone only mentioned one thing on paper, without a specific description of the content, followed by a series of strong warnings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that these materials are too old, distributed over a wide area, and appear in the ruins of alien races, it doesn't seem like they can be manipulated by individuals, and they can't help but suspect that this is a prank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need to think too much, even if you find detailed information, it is useless. The continent of Aslant ten thousand years ago is different from what it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race at that time was so weak that they could only survive in the cracks of other races, living a precarious life all day long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A slight move by the foreign race was a life-and-death test for the human race at that time. Perhaps the ten thousand year catastrophe in the eyes of the ancestors is just a cruel battle in our eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But since there is a saying of a thousand-year catastrophe, we have to make use of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to release the news, saying: The foreign races are plotting to unite, trying to start a war within a hundred thousand years and overthrow the dominance of our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    and other public opinion campaigns could not be worse, so they called on all countries in the mainland to launch a major purge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't expect to clean up all the alien races on the mainland, at least I have to disable them first, so as to prevent any possibility of their comeback! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Their existence directly blocks the Holy See on the peninsula, away from the center of the mainland. If you want to restore the glory of the Holy See, you must pull out this nail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at Gu Lei's easy words, just support the second prince's succession. In actual operation, it is almost impossible to use this plan to complete it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that it is just a change of heir, but in fact it is shaking the ancient succession system to the throne and impacting all monarchy countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of behavior that seriously violates the rules of the game will not only be rejected by the nobles of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, but also strongly opposed by countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it has been planned for many years and penetrated into the Kingdom of Ruthenia for many years, it is still a paper plan in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, someone took the lead in breaking the rules of the game, and the Holy See was too happy, so how could it continue to maintain the rules?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the core strategy of the Holy See, and Blake knows that no matter how much he opposes it, it is useless, so he can only suffer this boring loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, the leader of the Blake Legion whose IQ reoccupied the high ground immediately added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, although the current international situation is what we want, we still need to contain the great enemy of the Alpha Kingdom, and we cannot allow them to easily carve up Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We already hold a large number of war bonds of the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Alpha. As long as we sell them, it will immediately trigger a run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi Principality, which has the worst finances, will definitely not be able to sustain it. Perhaps as long as the run on starts, they can only choose to go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the chain reaction, the Alpha Kingdom cannot escape. The huge debt was suppressed all of a sudden, no matter how united the nobles in their country were, they would not be able to raise enough cash for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the finances of the Alpha Kingdom were ruined, even if the Counties of Korubia delivered it to their mouths, they would not be able to eat it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle that if you can't be beaten to death, you must be disgusted to death. He is unwilling to give up any opportunity to attack the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one objected this time, regardless of whether the plan can be realized in the end, it is always right to try hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, throw out all the war bonds in our hands at once to create as much panic as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrange our people to mix in and guide them, and encourage these little nobles to go to the two countries to pay in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plan carefully. After the operation is completed, all traces of our participation will be erased immediately, so that no one can find out that this matter has something to do with us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly ordinary means of economic attack can cause lethality, but it is not small at all. Not only would it implicate that hapless man in the Principality of Moxi, but it would also affect countless bondholders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news leaks out, there will be many people who will be offended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal situation, the Alpha Kingdom can fulfill its debts. Once it is run to the point of default, it is 100% reckless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the national reputation has been lost, even if it continues to perform debts later, it will not be recovered. It is better to smash the cans, at least it can save a huge sum of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Pius VII frowned. Deep down, he's starting to wonder if it's the right thing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bankrupting the Alpha Kingdom's finances will indeed have a great political impact, but it will also save money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing around, the heavy debt burden that was originally on them was directly unloaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how hard you scold, it's useless, no money is no money. Under the wave of runs, it is impossible for the Alpha Kingdom to come up with so much cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current international situation, the plan to secretly promote armed debt collection that was initially expected has also died at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII was very worried, and instead of suppressing the Alpha Kingdom, he was self-defeating, reducing the financial burden for the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, looking at the diplomatic documents flying like snowflakes, Caesar IV showed an imperceptible smile at the corner of his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The content above is all criticism, protest, and condemnation. The strong words and the serious tone made him bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with so many condemnation documents, none of them stated that they would send troops to interfere!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No actual action, only verbal condemnation, Caesar IV has no pressure at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How is the negotiation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Kingdom of Hesse going?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying such a high price, how can we not reap enough benefits?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially as a new king, Caesar IV, whose foundation is not yet solid, still needs to submit a satisfactory answer sheet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the prestige of the monarch?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a promise that is illusory, nor is it the courage to kill and kill decisively, but it can bring tangible benefits to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are a group of realists. Only when they bring benefits to everyone can they gain everyone's sincere support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Except for some minor details that need to be communicated later, we have already negotiated the general direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, the Kingdom of Hesse will annex the Counties of Korubia. As compensation, the Kingdom of Hesse will forgive all our debts to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the direct debts between the two governments, as well as the war bonds we sold in Hesse, totaling about 9.93 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the debt relationship between us and the Cuban country, it will naturally be cleared together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the total amount of this part of the debt will not be less than six million gold coins. If you count the old accounts, the number will be even larger. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis' words did not cause any waves. Although the country of Columbia is a small country, it has been a vassal of the Alpha Kingdom for a long time in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss is fighting in the front, how can the younger brother not show it. They don't need to lead people to fight on the battlefield in person, and money and food must be supported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Over time, a huge amount of foreign debt was owed. It's just that this creditor is easy to talk to, and he can delay paying back slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current counties of Colombia will soon die. The creditors have been tossed away, and the debts naturally do not need to continue to be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this operation alone, the total debt of the Alpha Kingdom has dropped by nearly one-sixth from 100 million at its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This method of repaying debts is much easier than collecting taxes from nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that this operation is a one-time operation. The deduction is still the book data, and no one has seen the cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"well!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Caesar IV said helplessly: \"Forget it, this time it will be cheaper for the Hessians. We will not get involved in the follow-up matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Corubia's hundreds of years of accumulation, if we can get it, our financial pressure will definitely be greatly reduced. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the country of Korubia has been passed down for hundreds of years after all, even if it is annexed by the Kingdom of Hesse, it will not be digested for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, Louis Vuitton is not prepared to organize human resistance. This means that they have to take over all the nobles of Counties of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people are hot potatoes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these guys are not cleaned out, their annexation of Korubia will remain on paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing these guys will cause turmoil in the noble world. Not to mention losing their national reputation, if they expand abroad in the future, they will be desperately resisted by everyone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, tried to persuade him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he has been frightened by Caesar IV's wild ideas. I am afraid that my own king will carve up Korubia with the Kingdom of Hesse regardless of the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military, there is nothing wrong with doing this. The kings of the family are all badly placed, so one can imagine how weak the resistance will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, after taking Corubia, things became troublesome. Not only are the nobles difficult to deal with, but the kingdom's internal distribution of spoils is also difficult to handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pulling the domestic nobles to carve up together, the meat is obviously not enough. What's more, this newly annexed area with unstable borders is not suitable for splitting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the royal family eats alone, the nobles in the country will definitely make trouble. If it is not done well, the throne of Caesar IV will be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the best choice is to sell Korubia in exchange for a sum of cash to repay the kingdom's debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not that troublesome, they all chose to annex Korubia, and the Hessians don't care about food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Planting and framing this kind of thing, once there is the first time, there will be countless times. As long as the Hessians are willing, are they afraid that they will not find a chance to fabricate crimes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just watch, the nobles of Corubia will soon be in bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the toss is almost over, that old guy Alexander V will come out to pretend to be a good person again, announce the pardon of these unlucky people, and restore their status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, by that time, the nobles of the Counties of Korubia were almost dead. Individuals who survived can't afford to overturn any big waves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV had just finished speaking when he realized that everyone was looking at him wrongly. Conscience of heaven and earth, he is only deducing the next actions of the Kingdom of Hesse, definitely not what he intends to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this time, it seems pointless to explain. Everyone had no hope at all for his integrity as a king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, such a sinister and vicious method is beyond the imagination of normal people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, now that you have insight into the next plan of the Hessian Kingdom, then share it with the Hessians and let them add money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Corubia's hundreds of years of accumulation, if all of them are found, it will not only be such a small amount of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are land, serfs, castles... so many industries, even if we only take part of them, we can sell tens of millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is now in need of population to fill the northern provinces. If hundreds of thousands of people can be distributed, this development progress will definitely be greatly accelerated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they refuse to pay, we will send troops to **** it. With the professional quality of the Kingdom Army, they will definitely grab more than them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he, the Minister of Military Affairs, was firmly opposed to framing Korubia, but now that there are so many benefits, his position will inevitably be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If enough benefits can be obtained from it, not only will the kingdom's financial pressure be greatly reduced, Caesar IV will also be able to establish prestige in the hearts of domestic nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Exchanging the kingdom's international image for the monarch's internal prestige, the pros and cons are hard to tell, but for the royal family, it is completely acceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Duke Efiero, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working hard to negotiate with the Hessians. It's just a matter of sending troops, it's better not to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation of the Kingdom's army, no matter how much spoils they get, the Ministry of Finance will not be able to share much, and it may not even be enough for military expenses. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis hurriedly blocked the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robbery by soldiers is too common in the continent of Aslante. This scene will appear in almost all foreign wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, most of the stolen spoils were divided among the noble officers below. Even if there is another copy, it will be withheld by the military for various reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To expect to make a fortune from robbery, the army must first be severely rectified, and the concept of \"everything seized and returned to the public\" must be instilled in their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing, just think about it secretly. In actual operation, there is no feasibility at all. The army of a joint-stock country is essentially pieced together.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The countries in the north who were stimulated were looking for reasons to send the pregnant female beast back to the country in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Warcraft cubs that belonged to Hudson, everyone used the simplest and rude method—throwing money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, it was the Kingdom's unethical actions that caused everyone to lose trust. Now people would rather risk the risk of a half-way miscarriage of the female animal than to stay longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the window paper was not pierced, everyone knows that with the disappearance of the last common interest, from today onwards, the Northland Alliance will exist in name only.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating again and again, Hudson finally gave up the idea of ​​​​taking the opportunity to \"rip off\". This kind of thing is too hurtful and not conducive to sustainable development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kane, go for me. Tell them, everything is done according to the prior agreement, and the mountain leader welcomes them to come and visit at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including people from the Counties of Korubia, if they want to leave with the female beast, they will also be released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to strengthen the guard in the territory from now on. I don't want any accident to happen to any of them before they leave the sphere of influence of the mountain territory! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was nothing he could do about it. At this point, all Hudson can do is to minimize the economic impact on his territory after losing the Warcraft base.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this group of high-quality consumer customers, Dadir City, which prospered because of the establishment of the World of Warcraft base, is bound to usher in a Great Depression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coping method, Hudson only thought of shock therapy. People leave, the market is gone, and the supporting business and service industries can only follow the cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the size of a mountainous territory, it simply cannot support a bustling big city. Even with the purchasing power of some neighboring nobles, it is not enough to maintain the current prosperity of Dadir City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the families of the nobles are counted, if he can gather a thousand customers with purchasing power, he will be counted as a loser for Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited number of customers, still playing the primitive territorial economic model, self-sufficient in food, clothing, housing and transportation, everyone's business needs are really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most demanded commodity is table salt, followed by iron farm implements. Luxuries such as Warcraft meat, spices, tea, and silk have very limited sales.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all came from aristocrats all the way. Hudson is very aware of the purchasing power of this group, and basically has little development potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they have money, they still have to save to buy life essence for the younger generations, buy knight equipment, and prepare for the big wedding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the future, there will be another standard configuration—Warcraft mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, there are too many places where everyone needs to spend money. There is simply no extra funds that can be taken out and squandered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, let people from other forces leave, that's all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Korubians are the masterminds behind the vain attempt to provoke a war between the Kingdom and the Hessians. It would be too cheap for them to just let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it gets out, it will be difficult for the king's capital to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they were let go, these people might not be able to go far. There are too many people thinking about them, I'm afraid there will be an accident just after leaving the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to be cheap than to be cheap to others...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Kane could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"This advantage can be taken by any force, but we can't touch it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft Base is a signboard of the Mountain Territory. Even if it is temporarily vacant, there will still be a day of prosperity in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the money is gone, it can be earned again; if the monsters are gone, they can continue to breed; once the reputation is gone, it is really gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to inform Governor Pierce of the news that the Korubians are leaving with the monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, I owed him a favor, and I just took the opportunity to repay the debt. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to sell to the Dalton family at this time actually has no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open the map and know that if the Korubians want to leave from the mountain territory, they must either cross the Blackstone Mountains and borrow from the Kingdom of Hesse; or they have to wander around the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Hesse is a deadly enemy, and they will definitely not go, so there is only one road left in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wandering around the door of the Dalton family, it would be difficult not to be noticed. Anyway, I can't touch it, Hudson doesn't mind sending it out as a favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that the Corubians are a big piece of fat, but this piece of meat is not so delicious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles these days are more bloody. If the Korubians are sure that they can't escape, there is a high probability that they will kill the female beast directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What they slaughtered were their own monsters, and no one had the right to interfere. No matter how angry the Dalton family is afterwards, they can't do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Robbery\", this kind of thing can't be brought to the table after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be fun if the Corubians could **** Governor Pierce into killing a few nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Corubia County, Louis Vuitton III, who has arranged for his descendants, is quietly waiting for the disaster to come in the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the ministers of the kingdom have long since disappeared. If nothing else, this group of people is currently busy mobilizing contacts to find relationships in order to preserve their existing interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Loyal ministers may exist, but when Louis Vuitton III, the king, chose to lie down and directly ordered the Earl's army to let the enemy in, they lost their fighting spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also feeling a headache is the Marquis Relian, the commander of the Hesse Kingdom's Expeditionary Army. It was hard to get this combat mission. I wanted to make a name for myself through this war, but the enemy directly smashed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before sending troops, Alexander V repeatedly emphasized that he should take advantage of the opportunities on the battlefield to clear the kingdom of future ruling obstacles as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of important ministers in the capital also hinted at him to be cruel. Make a contribution to the long-term stability of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for not directly ordering him to find an opportunity to massacre the nobles of Korubia, it can be said that everyone can do it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Marquis of Lelian was also planning to use his hands on the battlefield to severely injure the ruling group of the Earl of Korubia and make contributions to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, after entering the Counties of Corubia, Marquis Relian had no choice but to realize that the idea is beautiful, but the reality is cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Armed resistance does not exist. The only thing the Korubians did was to invite ministers from various countries to act as witnesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the massacre of nobles, he accidentally killed a few serfs during the march, and he was sprayed **** by a group of ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone has a sense of justice, it's purely because of human instinct. Everyone doesn't eat meat, but the Hessen family eats meat, who can feel balanced?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't find an opportunity to add some obstacles to them, everyone's ideas will not be clear. Only then did a group of ministers act together with the army to catch their pigtails.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arriving at the capital smoothly, looking at the palace in front of him, Marquis Lelian was in a full mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is won?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he didn't fight a single battle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occupying the Counties of Colombia is easy, but what about the next rule?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To solve this problem, there is one core that cannot be avoided: how to deal with Alexander V and the nobles of the Count of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing is definitely impossible. Massacring thousands of nobles at one time, not only he, the commander of the army, could not afford the resulting responsibility, but the Kingdom of Hesse could not afford it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are not killed, the positioning of these people will be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing more than a short noble, anyway, it's just a name, even if it is kept intact, it will not affect the interests of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those nobles with fiefdoms can't take them for their own use, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't consider the loyalty of these people, you have to think about the many nobles in the capital who are waiting to share the cake, and the noble officers who followed him are all looking forward to it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness Louis Vuitton, Marquis Relian sends you greetings!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He spoke politely, but deep down he felt contempt. Louis Vuitton is definitely the biggest person responsible for the situation from being a high-ranking king to the current situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he is more politically sensitive, he will not rush to jump out as a traitor to show his loyalty before the situation is clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's right to stand on the side of the winner, but it's a pity that Louis Vuitton collapsed. No one likes traitors. It seems like an ordinary line-up, but at the same time disgusted the Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the scene in front of him, he planted a bitter fruit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or they pay attention to the development of armaments on weekdays and train a battle-ready army of 30,000 to 50,000 soldiers. Encountering enemy invasion, there is also a chance to circle the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, Marquis Relian. Now you are the winners. As a loser, I am not entitled to equal treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell me, that **** Alexander V, what do you want to do with me? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Louis Vuitton III said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a king is good at this point, regardless of the size of the country and its strength, the monarch is always the monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how presumptuous Louis Vuitton was, Marquis Relian could only stare blankly and give the other party a courtesy that fit his status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While serving the good, the personal safety of Louis Vuitton III must also be protected. Not even suicide is allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because regardless of the way of death, as long as an accident occurs within his control area, Marquis Relian will be unable to eat and walk around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, please calm down. In recent days, the evil cult has infiltrated your country very strongly in July, and even controlled the government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty is worried about your personal safety, so he specially asks His Majesty to bring your family and live in our royal capital together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the dust settles, if His Highness wants to come back to live again, he can come here anytime. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Relian said in as kind a tone as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he is not afraid of Louis Vuitton III making troubles. If the king in front of him can make a fuss, he can save a lot of trouble, but he is afraid that this guy will commit suicide if he thinks about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As you please, the country of Korubia is now yours, so you can do whatever you want!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I'm not going anywhere now. Even if you die, you must die in this palace! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Louis Vuitton III sneered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the country of Columbia, in order to appease the people, it is impossible to treat him badly. Once you go to the Kingdom of Hesse, you will lose any right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, I think it's better for you to go. If you insist on staying here, in case something unexpected happens, everyone doesn't want to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, your prince and princess are cute. Now that you have been taken to the capital by us, we are waiting for you to reunite in the past. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Relian threatened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Really, then I will trouble your king to take care of it. We are also relatives, and if you want to come to Alexander V to be your uncle, you will not treat them badly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Louis Vuitton's ridicule, Marquis Relian held back his stomach and had nowhere to vent his anger. There is no way, the two royal families are really relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you count them in detail, the monarchs on the entire Aslant continent can be related to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning the children of Louis Vuitton in advance is indeed a bargaining chip, but they can only hold these chips in their hands and cannot move them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the extremely bad Louis Vuitton, under the existing rule system, the Marquis of Reliant is really helpless against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The high-yield bonds that originally had a premium are also being sold with tears at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the influence of panic, more and more people believe in rumors. The lower the price of the bond, the less likely anyone will buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the leadership of those who are interested, countless bondholders have asked the governments of the two countries to pay in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reports sent back by envoys stationed abroad, Caesar IV lost a lot of hair again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before taking the throne, he longed for power; after taking this position, he realized how difficult it is to be a king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is tiring to handle it by yourself; to delegate power to subordinates, but worry that the power will be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the feedback from all over the world. If this matter is not handled well, our bonds issued internationally will usher in a big run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We called everyone here today to discuss how to avoid the outbreak of this bond run. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Caesar IV distributed the thick stack of documents in his hand to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contents above are all similar, but they come from different places, so it is enough to just read one copy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a rough scan, everyone's faces turned gloomy. Obviously, the actual situation is more serious than what Caesar IV said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the wave of bond runs is probably unstoppable. Rumors like this appearing all over the mainland at the same time, obviously someone is secretly manipulating them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy came prepared, and it is definitely not something we can resolve with a few explanations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we must prepare for the worst and try our best to prevent the kingdom from going bankrupt in the run-on wave. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said with a bitter face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the bankruptcy he is talking about refers to the bankruptcy of the government's reputation, not financial bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a large-scale bank run breaks out, there is only one thing Alpha Kingdom can do—lay flat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No money means no money. Even if you sell everything, you won't be able to raise enough funds in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the country can't count on it, and the small nobles are already poor. The great nobles are still working hard to prepare for the battle, and it is impossible to take out the last family fortune to fill the hole for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is destined not to pay back the money, then simply not to pay it back. Relying on these debts, the Alpha Kingdom's finances were immediately revived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are visible, but the consequences are dire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter trouble in the future, if you want to borrow money again, it is definitely hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more troublesome is that the country's reputation is gone, and political and diplomatic activities will be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred of creditors is also a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can spend money to buy war bonds are not small leeks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big aristocrats transferred the risk, and the small and medium-sized aristocrats with delayed information not only did not run away, but acted as receivers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are also the ruling class, at least locally, they have a certain influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred of one or two is nothing, the hatred of a group of people can also affect the political position of the country where they are located.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there no way to deal with it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked unwillingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the total debts of the kingdom are as high as more than 96 million gold coins. Including loans between countries and bonds issued by us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the domestic debt is about 36 million yuan. Don't worry too much about this part for the time being. Nobles will not be foolish to stab their knives at such a time. What needs to be resolved is the international debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the deal between us and the Kingdom of Hesse is successfully concluded, it is expected to reduce 16 million to 18 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimate optimistically, and calculate it based on 4,200 gold coins. Among them, the war bonds accounted for about 30 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, the bond of 30 million gold coins will not be rushed to us to pay all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time, it was obvious that someone was secretly manipulating it, and it cannot be judged according to normal economic laws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe at that time, the war bonds circulating in the kingdom may also be transferred out and appear in the wave of runs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much cash we need to prepare depends not only on ourselves, but also on the Principality of Moxi next door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they withstand the shock, under the guidance of confidence, we can calm down the storm by preparing eight million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Moxi people have already embarked on the road of borrowing new ones to repay the old ones. I am afraid that they will fall down as soon as the run on them breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, panic will superimpose, even if you prepare 30 million gold coins, you may not be able to withstand the shock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the governments of various countries will jump out and stab us to collect debts in advance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Data will not lie, Marquis Delgado's words completely cut off Caesar IV's thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eight million gold coins, everyone can find a way to make up. Thirty million gold coins, then don't think about it, the Alpha Kingdom is not that rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe he felt that what he just said was too absolute. After hesitating for a while, Marquis Delgado added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is still a solution, but the consequences are a bit serious, and the gains may even outweigh the losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we acquiesce in the Kingdom of Dante and the Kingdom of the South Coast going north to annex the Counties of Glint and Nadal, we can probably pay back 10 million gold coins less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go further, acquiesce in the annexation of the Kingdom of Oprus by the Franks, the annexation of the Kingdom of Avalat by the Kingdom of Iberia, and the invasion of the Kingdom of Turan by the Holy See...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Satisfying the ambitions of all countries on the continent, then our debt problem will no longer be a problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it. The debt problem does not exist in this way, and it is all transformed into a national defense problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In less than ten years, the continent of Aslant will transition into the era of \"hegemony\". If you are lucky, the Alpha Kingdom can become one of the overlords, if you are unlucky, it will die halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Delgado, your thinking is too simple. Not to mention the sequelae of doing so, the acquiescence of the Kingdom of Light is not as valuable as you think.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Northern Continent, our right to speak is indeed very important, but when it comes to other parts of the mainland, that's the case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a flag-declared stand up to support them, there may be some possibility, but there is not much hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with a dispensable support, everyone is more willing to exclude a competitor first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only those engaged in diplomacy know how unfavorable the current international situation is to the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This debt crisis seems to be planned by someone, so is it not the result of the collusion of various countries?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are not a few major powers acquiescing, who has the ability to launch together on the whole continent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the entanglement of the Alpha Kingdom, the Principality of Moxi, which is also deeply in debt crisis, is another scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the back garden of the royal palace, King George was making tea and chatting leisurely with a group of princes and ministers, without any trace of tension.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you found out who is targeting the Principality?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George asked calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of behind-the-scenes manipulations, the Moxi Principality has secretly settled most of its debts by \"inheriting knowledge and repaying debts with special cultivation resources\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current trend of bankruptcies is just a show deliberately staged to deceive people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, their transaction broke the current unspoken rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It takes time to transform theoretical knowledge into strength, and the small and medium-sized nobles involved in the transaction need to keep secrets more than the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the news leaks out, the Principality of Moxi will certainly be suppressed by all parties, but these traders will be doomed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If King George hadn't discovered that someone was plotting secretly, he would not bother to pay attention to these disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, all direct clues have been cut off. However, according to the speculation of the nobles who traded with us, the mysterious person who found them may come from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comprehensive analysis of various data shows that their main target for this operation is the Alpha Kingdom, and we are just pawns for them to attack the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys are trying to crush the Principality's finances through a bond run and force us to default on our debts, which will trigger a larger scale of panic and ignite the Alpha Kingdom's huge debt mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these people have calculated thousands of times, and they didn't expect that the principality has solved the debt problem. No matter how big a wave is set off now, it is doomed to be useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the principality's finances are not broken, everyone's confidence in the Alpha Kingdom will not be shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, from a bright point of view, the financial situation of the Alpha Kingdom is much stronger than ours! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, even if there is no definite evidence, he still believes that the Holy See is behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the reason is, Count Renato has no good feelings for the Holy See who wants to push them to the abyss of hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a kind of enjoyment to be able to watch the behemoth of the Holy See fail, and to watch their plans fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It really is the Holy See!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know what the Alpha Kingdom did to make the Holy See hate it to the core, so it didn't hesitate to make such a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I guessed correctly, they would at least have to lose hundreds of thousands of gold coins for the crazy suppression of bond prices this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is also good, the alliance between our two countries will be more stable if the Holy See adds chaos to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three major kingdoms in the central region are about to move, and the trend to the north is already unstoppable. The principality still needs time to recover, and now it needs Alpha people to stand in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send a copy of the found information to Caesar IV. By the way, tell them: the principality is united at this moment, and all the nobles will unite to deal with the crisis, and it will not be so easy to be defeated. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make bricks without straw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the opportunity come to him helplessly, limited by the lack of strength of the Principality of Moxi, he could only choose to restrain his ambition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous territory, Hudson was happily welcoming the opening of the canal, imagining the next great economic development of the territory, and received a blow to the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turbulent debt crisis swept across the Alpha Kingdom, as if the whole world knew the news overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of political savvy knows what to face next once a bank run occurs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bonds in the hands are reduced to waste paper, the key is the political and economic impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political crisis, Hudson has been too lazy to think about it. When the sky falls, the tall man will bear it first, and let the king and the ministers worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But economic problems are unavoidable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seven grassland countries market that was finally opened up with great difficulty may be closed directly. Even if it can be kept, the price paid will not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next maritime strategy must also be readjusted. For the time being, international trade is out of the question. In the next few years, let's do domestic trade with peace of mind!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emerging aristocrats are so hard-pressed, and even a little trouble can cause a major impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced by a well-established old nobleman, he would definitely not be so flustered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the Dalton family as an example. They are also engaged in international trade, so they are not afraid of such turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, they have regular partners in many countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few marriages with each other, and everyone has established a community of interests long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's political fluctuations. Even if two countries go to war, it won't affect their continued business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, Mr. Jose has entered the territory. Because there are family members accompanying him, he is expected to arrive at the Lord's Mansion in five days.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom's words made the sad look on Hudson's face a lot less. After planning for so long, he finally succeeded in poaching corners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Not in vain, he came to greet him in person. Judging by the length of the team, he knew that he came with a \"certificate of voting\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took nearly two years to lay the groundwork back and forth, and it didn't take so much trouble to just dig out one person. A wise man knows what to do next with a hint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The royal family has never lacked followers. Every year, countless young noble children bid farewell to their parents and leave the house to seek opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially a hero like Caesar III is more attractive to talents. With the influx of noble children one after another, the talent pool of the royal family has already reached a terrifying number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anything in excess becomes worthless. Many people are followers of the king in name, but in fact they are disciples.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply: the royal family does not have enough jobs for them, but provides them with simple board and lodging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Say hello when you have something to do, they will go to help with it, and you can get a reward from the royal family when it is done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who perform well can take advantage of the trend and enter the royal family to serve. After working hard and accumulating enough credit, you will have the opportunity to obtain titles and even fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, those who can stand out from others are mostly powerful knights. War is their road to fame and wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grassroots civilian posts are too replaceable, and they have long been divided up by the offshoots of the royal family and the children of retainers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-level civil servants have high requirements for talents, but they also have higher requirements for loyalty. Those who are not core personnel are basically useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose was a lucky one. He first entered the royal team by virtue of his own force, and then stood out by virtue of his outstanding military command ability, and got into the position of a court earl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance from entering the core team is such a close call. It's a pity that in a test at a critical moment, Jose's luck ran out and he was beaten back to his original shape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the purpose of winning people's hearts, the material treatment has not been reduced, but the status has plummeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not without benefits to decline in status, so the attention is low. Including Caesar IV's succession to the throne, when all the retainers of the royal family swore allegiance, they ignored him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for why Jose was ignored, Caesar IV's indifference towards him accounted for half of the reason, and the other half was because Master Hudson wasted money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The person who makes the king hate him will not appear in front of the king.\" The king is satisfied, the people who collect money feel at ease, and those who spend money get things done, and everyone gets what they need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, without a formal oath of allegiance, the two parties have not established a relationship between monarch and minister, and there is no need to perform obligations to Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no obligation to restrain, as a free man, Jose can accept Hudson's invitation with peace of mind, otherwise this behavior is \"betrayal\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the group of people who came with Jose are also free people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson's name is loud enough, otherwise, there would be no way to fool so many people in remote corners like the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the simple greetings, there will be a grand welcome banquet. All the high-level people in the territory came here, which can be said to be enough face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, this is the list of the team, and their background, character, character, and ability are also noted at the back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because time is too tight, this information is not very comprehensive, and some information may even have errors, so it can only be used for reference. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Jose had already handed over a thick parchment book, and it was obvious that he had put a lot of effort into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the accuracy cannot be fully guaranteed, it is inevitable. Parenthood, ability, and character can all be found out, but character is a magical thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, except for some extremists, most people are just ordinary people, and they cannot be simply described as good or bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, what he wants to use are talents, not moral saints. To be able to obey orders and implement tasks, it is enough not to do anything on weekdays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thanks for your hard work, Mr. Jose. With Mr.'s help, the future of my mountain territory will definitely be more brilliant!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said sincerely. As for the parchment book in his hand, he didn't look at it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sophisticated people are indispensable in any place. Just because someone has been dug out doesn't mean that someone's heart has also come over. The more talented you are, the harder it is to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose chose to switch jobs at this time, but in fact he had no choice but to do so. Caesar IV's ignorance made his life very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's poaching operation made him worse. Not only was his name erased during the oath of allegiance ceremony, but even the materials distributed to him by the royal family were getting less and less month by month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that if he did not make a choice, the royal manor where his family lived would be taken back in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People have a face, and Jose also wants face. If someone with a family and a family is kicked out, how can he gain a foothold?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, there are many great nobles who extended an olive branch to him, but the one with the most sincerity is Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Developing in the Mountain Territory, he can directly enter the inner circle; if he goes to other nobles, he still has to fight on the periphery, and he may even be suspected of being a spy planted by the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The earl is overwhelmed. The development of the mountain territory is obvious to all. Throughout the history of the human race, there are very few territories that can match the development speed of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And there are various special reasons behind the rapid development of these territories, but the mountainous territories are truly self-made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the generous development of the swamp is even more breathtaking. Your Excellency the Earl's ability to govern the region can be said to be unprecedented...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of flattery, Hudson knew that Jose had grown up. If he had been so flattering during the expedition to the Principality of Moxi, the relationship with Caesar IV would not have been so bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the relationship is good, everything is not a problem. Even if he couldn't persuade the crown prince at the time, he would be caught out if he was blamed. No matter how miserable the situation is, it is not possible to not even have a title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, there is no need to talk about this between us. Now we are all on our own, so we can just talk about anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inviting Mr. to join is to help me improve the strategic plan, and to check for omissions and fill vacancies during the specific implementation process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. may not know that the kingdom is about to face a big trouble—the debt crisis may be about to erupt! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this appalling news, Jose's expression changed drastically, but he soon calmed down. Hudson's calm expression is really reassuring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, do you already have a solution?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he racked his brains, he couldn't figure out why his lord could remain so calm at the moment when the kingdom's reputation was on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is caused by the unequal information between the two parties. It is inconvenient for Hudson to say anything about the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the limited information, as long as the bond run breaks out, the reputation of the Alpha Kingdom, which is unable to make payments, will surely collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who gives the creditor an advantage in the previous debt relationship?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, begging others to buy bonds, naturally, it is inevitable to formulate special clauses in favor of creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement: once a force majeure event occurs, everyone thinks that there is a problem with the kingdom's repayment ability, and the creditors have the right to request early exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally this article was prepared for the great nobles. In case the money is really not paid in the future, they can jump out of the car in advance based on the information difference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson's showy operation later made them suddenly realize that they can also sell the bonds in their hands at a higher price, so that the proceeds can be pocketed in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of twists and turns, the current situation came into being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whether the kingdom's reputation will collapse depends mainly on confidence. As long as everyone's confidence in the kingdom remains intact, we can survive this storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to ensure that everyone's confidence in the kingdom is not lost. As long as the Principality of Moxi, whose financial situation is even worse, can survive the crisis, then everything will be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, the Principality of Moxi has adopted contingency plans. While mobilizing the domestic nobles to tide over the difficulties together, they sent representatives to conduct emergency consultations with creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to preserve the reputation of the kingdom, I also did my best. Not only did he not repay the bonds in his hands in advance, but he also helped them persuade a group of nobles in the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Creditors in other places were almost appeased by them. Perhaps it won't be long before there will be news that the Principality of Moxi has survived the debt crisis safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi people can survive, let alone the kingdom. Although the nobles in the country did not follow suit and asked the kingdom to pay the bonds in advance, the current bond prices in the market still collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that bonds with a 20% discount have already appeared in the market. If the panic continues to ferment, bonds with a 30% discount, 40% discount, 50% discount or even lower may appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to let go of the opportunity to make a fortune that comes to your door. I have prepared two million gold coins for this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many people in the territory who can provoke the leader. I hope that Mr. Jose can take on this important task and buy the high-interest bonds previously issued by the kingdom at the lowest possible price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the crisis is over, wait for an opportunity to sell these bonds. My requirements are not high, and I will raise the funds required for port construction and shipyard construction with one entry and one exit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost forgot, Berkshire Shipyard is already mine. Now we are waiting for the completion of the construction of the dock before relocation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sailors and boatmen are also ready, and the artificial canal leading to the ocean in the territory has also been successfully opened this month. It will take some time to get involved in ocean trade, but developing a little fishery is not a problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he deliberately showed off, showing off part of his family background, but mainly to win the hearts of the younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from Jose's unbelievable expression, Hudson knew that his plan had succeeded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, my lord, I will definitely handle this matter properly. However, the amount of money involved is too large, and you need to send some people to assist me to complete it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To purchase so many bonds at one time, it is too conspicuous to carry out in the southeast province alone, and it must be implemented in multiple places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, security is also a big problem. Guards are definitely indispensable, and it is best to have expert assistance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose made the request directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's family background is much stronger than he expected. Whether it is the control over the younger brother, or the financial, material and human resources revealed, they all far exceed expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that this time, I would spend more than ten years in silence and farm with peace of mind. However, judging from the current situation, it seems that this quiet period will be greatly shortened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will let Kane be your assistant, and you can choose the rest from the people you brought over. Let Tom arrange for me to protect you. In addition, Bear Stearns will also provide protection for you in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, most of the people in the territory have shown their faces on the battlefield, so it is easy to reveal their identities. If possible, it is best not to personally come forward to buy from the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I was in the Prairie, I worked with many chambers of commerce. There are also ready-made connections, so go and get in touch with them. If you can negotiate a price, you can also borrow a way this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Supervisors must be sent, two million gold coins are not two hundred gold coins, no matter how much you believe in any plug, he will not test humanity at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the real supervisor is not those cronies on the surface, but Bear Stearns who is hiding in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, as long as the interests are large enough, it is too easy to buy people's loyalty. In contrast, World of Warcraft is more reliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, in fact, you can also pull a few big nobles to build momentum, and call on domestic nobles to invest in the purchase of bonds together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only do we gain political prestige, but it is also more convenient for us to act secretly under cover of acquisitions on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the operation is improper and someone finds out halfway, we can still play the banner of defending the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose's proposal made Hudson happy. Facts have proved that this person did not dig in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who work in the royal family are different, and this kind of political awareness is not possessed by his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the best among the best, the best who finally enters the top management of the territory, in terms of political vision, they still only focus on their own one-acre three-point land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, this matter is settled like this. You go to select personnel first, and then take action after the political campaign is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it is estimated that in a few days, the kingdom will ask us local nobles for advice, and I will propose it together at that time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Principality of Moxi is mobilizing nobles across the country to raise funds, and also sent people to communicate with creditors. It is said that good results have been achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, many nobles have stated that they will not require early payment before the bond reaches the agreed date.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first nobleman to take the lead in expressing his opinion was the Earl of Hudson. Not only did he announce that he would not repay the bond in advance, he also successfully persuaded a group of nobles in the expeditionary army to make a promise together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by these good news, the war bonds, which had been plunging all the way, also rebounded slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the bonds of the Principality of Moxi, the circulation in the market has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that everyone is waiting and watching the situation. After all, selling at the current price is a blood loss. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Francis' words, Caesar IV didn't know for a while that he should praise Hudson for his overall view; he still scolded him for patronizing himself to gain fame, forgetting that the kingdom was also in deep debt crisis and needed support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to return to my thoughts, but in the end Caesar IV still didn't say anything. He is very clear that the current Principality of Moxi has no huge debts at all. Even if he takes the bonds and asks for early payment, he will not be able to exchange for money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bonds that cannot be converted into cash are naturally not considered money. With the credit of the Principality of Moxi in the eyes of the outside world, it is unrealistic to use the bonds issued by them as money to help the Alpha Kingdom tide over the difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is doomed that there is no way to cash out the payment immediately, so simply behave boldly and sell the Principality of Moxi as a big favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the confidence of the market is stabilized and the Principality of Moxi survives the storm, the Alpha Kingdom will also be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with Hudson doing this, and the other creditors of the Moxi Principality also doing the same, it seems too reasonable and somewhat illogical, but the facts are in front of him, and he can't help but believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, let's raise money quickly! On the issue of payment, be consistent with the Moxi people. As long as they can stick to it, we will stick to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the specific redemption date must be pushed back as much as possible, preferably after the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is any noise from the outside world, tell them that we are busy raising money and let them wait in peace. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Caesar IV's concerns have not disappeared. It is true that the Moxi people have achieved certain results on the road of repayment, and it is still unknown that they may not be able to survive the crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the restrictions are released for payment, the kingdom's little cash flow will soon be exhausted. At that time, the crisis we will face will only be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we can also copy the measures taken by the Moxi people. It is not difficult to obtain the support of the nobles in the country, but the difficulty is that they do not have much money in their pockets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the northern part of the kingdom are basically poor ghosts, and they can't afford money at all; the nobles in the south are richer, but at the moment they are busy building defense lines, and they may not be able to provide much support to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, the most important thing is to persuade the creditors not to run. Judging from the case of the Principality of Moxi, it is still possible to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, we are now required to pay, we are forced to default on our debts, all the bonds in their hands have become waste paper, and we can't even get the last gold coin! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado's analysis made Caesar IV calm down all of a sudden. Closed the loop logically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this analysis, the creditors of the Principality of Moxi agreed to give up paying in advance, not because they are reasonable, but because they don't want the bonds in their hands to become waste paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It doesn't itch when there are too many lice, and no worries when there are too many debts.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom followed suit and directly explained the relationship to the creditors, most of the creditors would have no choice but to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, let's try it! If the Moxi people can do this, then there is no reason why we will fail here. The only trouble is the mastermind behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, it is obvious that someone is messing up the bond market at any cost, trying to make us default on our debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi people suspect that the Holy See did it. Although there is no real evidence, they do have the motive to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, keep an eye on the Holy See. If they continue to make trouble for us, we will be in big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he finally understands why his father hates the Holy See so much, it's because those guys don't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other countries do not want the Alpha Kingdom to grow bigger, but they all have their own moral bottom line. At most, they just contributed to the flames behind, and didn't go straight out to stab the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, all countries will collect debts together, and the Alpha Kingdom will go bankrupt before the run on broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crisis is still raging, dominated by panic, and more and more creditors are demanding early payment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprises, Alpha Kingdom's public relations campaign ended in failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The domestic nobles expressed their support one after another, but that was only in words. In actual actions, Hudson actually went to buy bonds, and everyone else expressed it symbolically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Threats of bad manners can indeed deal with ordinary creditors, but for the Holy See who provoked this turmoil, they don't care whether the bonds in their hands will become waste paper at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vest trumpets acted as vanguards, and the creditors, who were a little distracted, joined the debt collection operation again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the last day of 99991, the run-on wave finally broke out, and the embassies of the Alpha Kingdom and the Moxi Principality were besieged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that the creditors who besieged the Principality of Moxi finally reached an agreement after rounds of negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The creditors who besieged the Alpha Kingdom were still in a stalemate there, but their emotions were inevitably affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone hadn't been agitating and exaggerating the risk of default, I'm afraid everyone would have chosen to compromise. After all, the annual bond interest is still being paid normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, Pius VII, who received the news, was directly blown away!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the result of your actions?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We spent huge sums of money to set off a wave of runs, just to make a fuss?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And what about the Principality of Moxi?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You keep saying that they will default on the contract, so why did you reach an agreement with the creditors first and get out of the debt crisis?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The almost roaring question made all the senior officials of the Holy See bow their heads. Everyone likes to do work that costs public money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This operation was jointly carried out by multiple departments of the Holy See. It is precisely because there are many people involved and many talents who make money from it that there will inevitably be some problems in the implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have limited funds, all of which are spent on suppressing the Alpha Kingdom, ignoring the Moxi Principality, which has even worse finances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, they put their lives to death and survived, and they actually made a dead game alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that at the negotiation site, the Moxi people directly offered two options: either they would pay normally according to the agreed date; or they would immediately declare a default on the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without our people making trouble, those creditors didn't want to receive a single gold coin, so they were forced to accept the normal payment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by this news, the Alpha Kingdom suddenly became stronger. They agreed to pay the bonds in advance, but asked to deduct the previously settled interest, bond issuance costs, and fund raising fees...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the messy deduction, they only accept 20% of the face value as payment, and they have to apply one month in advance, and they can only get the payment after approval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many creditors have been shaken, thinking that the Moxi Principality can survive the debt crisis, and the Alpha Kingdom with a better financial situation must be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people have applied, but that's not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, in order to create panic, we have sold a lot of bonds, and the war bonds we currently hold are less than 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the situation in other departments is similar. The war bonds in everyone's hands may not be able to make up a face value of one million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to break Alpha Kingdom's finances unless we collect more bonds from the market and use them to run, consuming their cash flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, after the Principality of Moxi passed through the debt crisis, the price of the war bonds of the Alpha Kingdom also began to pick up. From the 50% discount of the lowest price in the market before, it has risen all the way to the current 22% discount of the face price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-yield bonds issued in the early stage have been equal to the par price, and even overflowed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake didn't want to stand out, but Pius VII called his name just now, so he couldn't help but refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous bond sell-offs were all gradually dropped from a high level, but they did not lose much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now if you buy it from the market and then go to the Alpha Kingdom to cash it, you will definitely lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they can't lose a few points, but once they enter the market to buy on a large scale, the circulation price will definitely be fired up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot! Now that you know how to do it, why are you still doing it? Hurry up and send someone to implement it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, one or two million gold coins will be lost. As long as the reputation of the Alpha Kingdom can be destroyed, everything is worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, no matter what method you use, I must buy their war bonds as quickly as possible, and then immediately take them to pay them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII cursed angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political accounts have never been purely economic interests. Sometimes the style of play that hurts both sides must be persisted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing one million gold coins by myself and consuming the cash flow of the Alpha Kingdom's 10 million gold coins is definitely a strategic success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. After taking over the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the Holy See will face the strategic choice of going south or going north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, they can also choose to enter the Central Continent. It's just that the central part of the mainland is too crowded, and now there are not a few countries in the central mainland that don't have a soft persimmon, let alone the place where the Fourth World War was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Kingdom of Franks and the Kingdom of Libya in the southern continent...it is obvious that the countries in the northern continent are easy to bully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was originally targeted at the Kingdom of Alpha because of hatred and contradictions, it has now risen to a strategic level. Who let Caesar IV's showmanship make the Holy See see the possibility of annexing the Kingdom of Ruthenia?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson has already started preparing for the celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because there were too many interferences from human factors, the panic in the market did not last long. Especially after the Principality of Moxi was stabilized, the chamber of commerce that cooperated with Hudson also realized the business opportunity and joined in the action of snapping up bonds one after another, driving up the market price even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the Holy See joined the snap-up team, Hudson, who realized that the market was over, immediately ordered to stop the operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two million gold coins prepared in advance were only spent 1.6 million, but this did not affect the success of this speculation in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the earliest existence to make a move, the mountain leader obviously got the biggest piece of cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    1.6 million gold coins to buy a bond with a face value of 2.5 million, even if it is sold immediately at the current market price, you can still earn hundreds of thousands of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, because of the first-mover advantage, 40% of the 2.5 million bonds are high-yield bonds, and the annual interest rate can reach 10%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the market stabilizes, sell ordinary bonds one after another, and you can almost collect the principal, and the rest is blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the original goal of earning enough money to build docks and shipyards is still 100 million yuan away, it doesn't hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Withstood this shock, in the short term, Alpha Kingdom has no risk of default, and holding high-yield bonds to enjoy several years of income is also a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least from the perspective of capital return rate, the return rate of bonds is much higher than that of land reclamation and farming. This is a good business until there is no better investment target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is bleeding, but the Treasury is crying. The crisis of the Moxi Principality is over, and the troubles of the Alpha Kingdom are still ongoing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eight million cash raised by the kingdom with great difficulty was quickly cashed out. If it weren't for the one-month buffer period, I'm afraid he would have already laid down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on, isn't the market already picking up? Why are there still people running?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked with a puzzled expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although bond prices vary from place to place, they are generally on the rise. From the perspective of the general trend, it is only a matter of time before the normal price is restored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the market price is higher than the advance redemption price, it is obviously a kind of behavior that harms others and does not benefit oneself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the amount you hold is huge, you can sell it slowly. There is no need to bear the loss at all, and the Kingdom's Ministry of Finance is slammed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the people from the Holy See have taken action. This time they didn't even bother to cover up, the purpose is to consume our cash flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Ministry of Finance wanted to secretly sell a batch of recovered bonds and arbitrage them from the market. However, the outside world watched them too closely. In order to stabilize market confidence, we had to destroy the recovered bonds publicly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to stabilize the situation, you can only seek help from the outside world. The Ministry of Finance has already contacted major chambers of commerce, and they also promised to borrow funds, but their appetite is a bit big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on how much loss the Holy See is willing to bear. If they fight us at all costs, the next run will be even more serious. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado's explanation blew up all the high-level officials in the kingdom. The Holy See actually bought bonds from the market and cashed them in, it's a bit embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, in order to stabilize the confidence of the market, the Alpha Kingdom can only pretend that it is rich even if its pockets are clanging poorly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then spend time with them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doesn't the Holy See want to buy bonds from the market, just let them do it. The bonds recovered by the Ministry of Finance continue to be publicly destroyed, and I will find a solution for the funding gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I remember that the royal family still has more than 3 million war bonds in their hands. They arranged for people to sell them in batches, and the funds obtained were then lent to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not enough, then contact the nobles in the country, and then you can trade at arbitrage if you change hands, and see who can consume who!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The contact with the chamber of commerce cannot be interrupted, deliberately creating the appearance of exhaustion for the Holy See, and let them increase their investment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fuck this thing, now he is not going to want it. People in the Holy See dare to do the first day of the junior high school, and he dares to do the fifteenth day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you ZuttoMayo leader, one step closer to Baimeng, still short of...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, let's talk about the monthly pass, readers, bring it here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the narrowest place, the water surface is only more than 20 meters wide; in the shallowest place, the water depth is only four meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a river course can be navigated by a small boat with hundreds of tons. If you come to meet a few thousand-ton or two-thousand-ton boats in the river, I guess it will be the sight of the wrong car on the country road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jacob, what did your Ministry of Government Affairs do? Why didn't it meet the design requirements?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of manpower, financial resources, and material resources were invested, and the canal that was finally constructed did not meet expectations. Isn't this a slap in the face of his master Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, this artificial canal with a total length of more than 200 kilometers will be the most navigable canal in the Alpha Kingdom after it is opened to navigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the slogan, Hudson has a mind. In the future, this \"Swamp Grand Canal\" will be a business card of the mountainous territory to the outside world, showing the development of the territory's transportation to the outside world, so as not to be always regarded as a small rural place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan can't keep up with the changes. Judging from the current situation, the capacity of the Grand Canal in the Marsh is similar to that of several artificial canals in the kingdom, and it can't win the reputation of maximum navigation capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, we are carrying out construction according to the plan. Theoretically speaking, it is completely possible to carry two giant ships in parallel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the water flow of the canal can't keep up. Even if we have introduced multiple water sources in the territory, we still can't meet our expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is the dry season now. When there is enough rain in summer, the water level will rise and the design goal will be achieved. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob explained with an aggrieved face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord master personally grasped the canal project, they dare not take it lightly, but some things cannot be solved by hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is plenty of rain in the mountainous area, but no matter how abundant the rain is, there is an upper limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The water flow is so large, and the upper limit will be stuck if the canal is repaired casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, Hudson can also build a stepped canal, build a dam halfway to store water to ensure the water level, and open the gates at a fixed time every day for waterproofing and navigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the technology these days is not up to standard. It is easy to build a few gates. When it comes to actual operation, no one can guarantee whether they can be retracted freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the navigation situation along the way, you can know that, except for the special management agencies at the two ends to charge, the middle is completely free for everyone to navigate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rough management is no wonder the Ministry of Government Affairs, everyone is playing like this these days. The management of the Swamp Grand Canal also copied the operating model of other artificial canals in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also has no experience in this regard, and when it comes to specific operations, everyone can only feel their way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plagiarizing other people's management models may not be the best choice, but it is the most effective way to build a management system in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Aside from waiting for the abundant water season, does the Ministry of Government Affairs have no other options?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson continued to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he was still a little brooding over the fact that the navigability of the canal was not as good as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is a way, but the cost required is a bit high, the time is also very long, and there is no guarantee of success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs plans to widen the tributaries of the canal after the swamp is fully developed. It can not only facilitate daily irrigation, but also introduce the accumulated water from the Black Rock Mountains into the canal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current development progress, it will take us at least five years to complete the farmland transformation of the Great Swamp. Subsequent water conservancy project construction can only continue to be postponed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the Blackstone Mountains are often haunted by monsters, the Ministry of Government Affairs is still considering whether to leave some swamps as a buffer between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a direct conflict between these two plans, and they are still under internal discussion. There is no relevant plan and feasibility report analysis yet. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson sighed. There are many unsatisfactory things in the world. If you want to get one thing, you have to pay the price in other aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to stay close to the past and directly be neighbors with the monsters, Hudson himself dare not make a decision lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft all have a strong sense of territory. Once a conflict occurs in the past, it is almost inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't care about the low-level monsters on the periphery. If you dare to do something, arrest them. The female acts as a breeding animal, and the male acts as a mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he had to consider the idea of ​​high-level monsters. According to Bear Stearns, there are many scary guys in the Black Rock Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good-looking bear in his family said that the monsters in it were not easy to mess with, so Hudson naturally wouldn't make trouble for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that you offend all of them, even if you offend one of them, that is a huge risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the person who offends is an idiot like Maxim, then it's easy to solve. Design a few traps, and you can always trap the beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the person offended is a rogue bear like Bear Stearns who is good at hitting sap, then there will really be no peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that at that point, Hudson will have to bring his monster with him when he goes to the toilet, otherwise he may die inexplicably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to your rhythm, deal with it normally!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the canal has been opened, the next step is to make good use of this canal to make the territory's economy prosperous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, your Ministry of Government Affairs has a heavy task. Economic development is a long-term process, and in the short term, only industries suitable for mountainous areas can be selected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back to the sea, this is our greatest advantage, and we must use it as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 90% of the salt circulating on the market in the southeastern provinces comes from the sea, which is monopolized by the entire Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, our tentacles could not reach the sea. With the big swamp blocking, even if the salt is produced, management and transportation will be a big trouble, and you can only watch others get rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is different now. The sea does not belong to the Dalton family. They can extract salt from seawater, and we can do the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific salt-making process is described in detail in the database in the territory. Just take my warrant to get it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to salt, there is another industry—fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't underestimate the fishery industry. If it develops well, it can become another pillar industry in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Select a group of young and strong people from the local people, let them practice water skills in the canal, and when they are familiar with it, arrange people to go to the offshore area for experimental fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Building fishing boats and making various fishing tools are all related in the warehouse, you can find them by yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one else was surprised by what Hudson said, but Jose who was on the side was quite shocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an inland noble, the Koslow family should not have such partial information under normal circumstances. However, according to Hudson's tone, his lord not only has, but also has many types of materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buy from the royal family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it, the royal family was able to sell the shipyard to the Mountain Territory, that is already quite a miracle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want people to sell all the technologies needed for the development of the territory, then go to sleep! Even if the royal family is willing to sell it, it must be a sky-high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually these things are accumulated bit by bit by time and experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is another tacit understanding among the great nobles, deliberately setting up technical barriers to increase the difficulty of the rise of emerging nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking of Hudson's status in the later period of the war, Jose instantly understood. Typical get rich - by war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, he felt endlessly sad. On the battlefield where everyone went together, Hudson soared all the way, but he himself fell into the mundane world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, the work of port construction and shipyard relocation will be left to you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The construction of the port is nothing more than that, as long as there are relevant technical materials, and then select a group of craftsmen and peasants, and follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the relocation of the shipyard is a troublesome job. Not only the factory buildings, machinery and equipment, and raw materials for shipbuilding have to be moved, but also the employees and their families have to be relocated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally everyone was with the royal family, but suddenly they had to go to work with a rural nobleman, and there must be a gap in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the factors of the difficulty of leaving the homeland, it is almost inevitable that some people will resist migration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous immigration relocation, Hudson often encountered such things. It's just that the immigrants back then were all serfs, and they didn't have the courage to stand up to the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The craftsmen in the shipyard also have no personal freedom, but they are still superior to the serfs in terms of vision and insight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those designers who have read books and have their own ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want someone to work wholeheartedly in the future, you can't simply use force to solve the problem, you must appease what should be appeased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Jose hadn't joined, Hudson would have been prepared to go there and act as a corporal in order to buy people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Lord Earl, I will definitely handle this matter properly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Berkshire shipyard is not on the border with us, and it will pass through the territory of the Dalton family on the way. I'm afraid they will destroy it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship has eased, and that is also a competitor. In particular, the Koslow family's going to the ocean directly collided with the Dalton family's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is quite normal for a little accident to happen on the way. If the Daltons don't react, that's the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Mr. Jose! Governor Pierce is a person who takes the overall situation into consideration and will not provoke disputes at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, I just gave the Dalton family a big gift not long ago, and they were embarrassed to turn their faces so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the secret tricks, I will let Maxim hang around from time to time to frighten those Xiaoxiao. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to fighting and doing things, Bear Stearns is better with a flexible mind; but when it comes to being scary, Maxim is more professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the huge figure looks very good. Especially after following him, the body developed again and grew another two meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unknown how much the strength has increased, but the size is even more bluffing anyway. If you go out and pretend to be the Dragon King, I'm afraid 99.99%... people will be deceived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the task was assigned, a pair of Griffin cavalry suddenly descended from the sky and landed on Hudson's boat accurately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Earl of Hudson, we are ordered by the king to deliver this letter to you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Probing the magic together, and after confirming that there was no problem, Hudson took the letter along the way. In front of everyone, he opened the envelope directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back and tell Your Majesty that I have accepted this secret mission.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Hudson is very reluctant. But there is no way, the Holy See will consume the kingdom's cash flow even if it loses money, forcing the kingdom to declare a default on its debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV's response plan this time is very much in line with his appetite. Since the Holy See wants to buy war bonds in the market, then simply sell them more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these bonds must not be sold within the kingdom, otherwise the people in the Holy See will soon find out that something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to transport the bonds to various parts of the mainland, sell them to the Holy See in batches, and then receive them back for public destruction through redemption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current market price, if you go back and forth, at least 10% of the profit will be made. If bond prices continue to recover, profits will be even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money of the Holy See is not earned for nothing. If you want to collapse the kingdom's finances, you will naturally have to pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the biggest problem here is transportation. Sending ordinary people there, not to mention safety issues, is too late in terms of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    God knows how many bonds the Holy See received during the transportation. If a large amount of bonds were thrown at one time, the Alpha Kingdom would not be able to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally planned to be escorted by the Griffin Cavalry, but unfortunately the Griffon has limited physical strength and cannot carry a large amount of bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, they are also easy to expose. If they are stopped halfway, the kingdom will suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to choose, the most suitable for this task in the kingdom is Hudson, the Dragon Knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can not only guarantee efficiency, but also have sufficient force. Acting at night can also avoid the eyeliner of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, he is not the only one who performs the task together. The kingdom will also send sky knights and great magisters to **** them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the kingdom is playing too much this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deceive the Holy See once, Caesar IV not only took all the war bonds from the royal family, but also borrowed a large amount of bonds from the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, as long as the Kingdom government is willing to admit the internal debts, whether or not there is a bond will not affect the final payment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lend a pile of paper to help the kingdom through the financial crisis, so a little bit of patriotism, everyone still has it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know the exact amount, but it must be an astronomical sum anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the unlikely event that something unexpected happens in the middle and the bonds are not delivered to the place safely, the only way left for the Alpha Kingdom is to renege on the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV didn't speak to him. It is estimated that the news of selling bonds spread on the prairie earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the call for everyone to buy war bonds not long ago, it fell into the eyes of Caesar IV that Hudson was doing a political show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wishful thinking: The mountain region lacks financial resources, and it is impossible to spend a large amount of cash to take over the kingdom for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wrong cognition led to wrong results, and Hudson will naturally not help correct it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to deceive Caesar IV proves that his subordinates have done a good job of keeping secrets, and the news of the bottom-hunting has not yet leaked out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is undoubtedly good news. The news of the purchase of bonds has not been leaked out, and the sale of bonds in the future will cause market fluctuations, and no one will suspect him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson decided to take some private goods with him and send the low-interest rate bonds along the way for disposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money can never be earned, there is no need to accumulate a large amount of cash in it for the last few points of profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if people in the same industry find out, the excuses are ready-made, and help the younger brothers realize the bonds in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The dignity of the dragon was involved, and things suddenly became troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using a giant dragon as a pack horse is probably the first of its kind for a dragon knight. Searching through the memories in their minds, no one found anyone using a giant dragon to pull goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, what should we do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison's helpless Q&amp;A.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to this operation is Maxim. If the giant dragon refuses to cooperate and uses other transportation methods, many hidden dangers will definitely be added out of thin air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'll try to communicate with him first, Your Excellency knows the habits of giant dragons.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already greeted Maxim's family, which was really too much for Dragon Knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you want to blackmail, but you have to notify in advance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the dignity of the dragon talking about at this time, and I don't want Hudson to bring a big box when he came here just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone hadn't paid too much attention to this operation, I'm afraid they would have discovered that Maxim's words and deeds were inconsistent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon is not easy to raise. There is an old saying in the continent of Aslante: The knight pays for the behavior of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, I leave this matter to you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Maxim, how can he be a coolie?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all gold coins!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you feel that it is an insult to carry gold coins on the road, then I will keep your little treasury for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson secretly changed the concept without paying attention. If it weren't for the huge gap in strength between the two sides, he would have already hammered this stupid dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Impossible! Hudson, you miser, if you dare to touch Benlong's gold coins, I will turn against you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of gold coins, only the dragon cheated people, and I haven't heard of the dragon being cheated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this question, Maxim was filled with anger. In the past few days, he worked hard and sowed seeds for more than half a year, but Hudson usurped the final results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The euphemistic name is: Daily cultivation costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow the dragon knight, who has ever seen a dragon pay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't been beaten by the society before and was too eager to strengthen his strength, he wouldn't have compromised!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Mr. Maxim. Without your permission, I will not do this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this delivery mission, I think you need to think carefully. After all, your daily expenses are not small, and you are too lazy to earn your hard-earned money. Being in debt is not an option!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it's rare to come out of Dragon Island, and go back after hundreds of years, with such a small savings, you are embarrassed to say hello when you meet a familiar dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, do you think this will work? After completing the task, you will be rewarded with a box of gold coins. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried hard to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that these words are not only for Maxim, but also for all the masters present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, he was on a business trip. As a great nobleman in the kingdom, Hudson had to show his aristocratic awareness and could not ask for money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim did not have such a burden. The country that the dragon knight is loyal to does not mean that the dragon must also be loyal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the label of the giant dragon greedy for money has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and everyone can accept it if they take the opportunity to reap benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not enough, at least ten boxes. Don't try to fool Benlong. I have heard your previous conversations. These papers are very valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ten boxes of gold coins I want are probably less than one percent. With such a low shipping cost, you have already taken advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a few of them, if you can fly, fly yourself, I am not a random dragon! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Maxim's supernatural explanation, Hudson wanted to laugh, but was embarrassed to laugh out loud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a random dragon, and it's not a dragon if it's casual. Just once in love, a bunch of offspring were produced. There are hundreds of species involved, but I have never picked a food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not in a hurry to bargain, but turned his gaze to the crowd behind him, motioning for everyone to hurry up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps everyone has some understanding of the habits of giant dragons, and is very aware of how stupid it is to talk about money with giant dragons, so they chose to turn a blind eye to Hudson's hints.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difficult bargaining session is always the most tormenting. His lips were almost worn out, and he managed to convince Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already cursed. When encountering such a thing in the future, he will definitely avoid it immediately. This kind of double reed play is really too difficult to perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dead of night, a dragon came out through the sky. Everyone who stepped on the dragon's back for the first time was thrown dizzy. Especially the box on the dragon's back was flying around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the accompanying magicians reacted quickly and released the protective shield in time to avoid the tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Boxes of bonds were sent out, and the bond price rise that was originally caused by the Holy See's sweep of goods has gradually stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that at this moment, it's not the previous 12% discount, but 30% discount, 5% discount, 20% discount... Some high-yield bonds are even higher than the face price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these high-interest bonds have nothing to do with the Holy See. Their goal is to consume the cash flow of the Alpha Kingdom, and buying cheap ones is the kingly way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are constantly being exchanged, due to the one-month buffer period, the number of bonds in the hands of the Holy See is inevitably increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the bills reported by his subordinates one after another, Pius VII thought that his subordinates were capable at first, but gradually he realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Appointment-style exchange is too risky for those who hold a large number of war bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the cash flow of the Alpha Kingdom is exhausted before the payment is made, and the debt default is announced in advance, these bonds will be thrown into their own hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, don't continue to buy. First exchange the bonds in our hands, and then buy the second batch!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After completing the exchange, send someone to watch the people of the Alpha Kingdom to see if they are really burned publicly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I don't play finance, and I don't have a deep understanding of bond trading, and my thinking mode still stays in the general commodity trade of buying low and selling high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to send someone to supervise the burning of bonds in the Alpha Kingdom is the limit that Pius VII can think of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, these bonds have magical imprints, which retain the traces of the years. The specific issuance time and number of issuances can all be checked, eliminating the possibility of additional issuance after the fact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Caesar IV is calling on nobles across the country to raise money. It is said that tens of millions of gold coins have been raised. The tens of millions of bonds in our hands alone may not destroy their finances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the hearts of the people in the market have stabilized, except for ourselves, almost no one asks them to cash in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we gave them time to raise money, all our previous efforts would be for naught. What's more, the bond price is still climbing slowly, and our acquisition cost will be higher in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Sauron stepped forward to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this wave of massive operations, the various departments involved in the operation have made a lot of money from it. No matter how much the Pope emphasizes strengthening supervision, the specific operational power is in the hands of specific executors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current market situation, basically if you buy one million war bonds and take them back to the Alpha Kingdom for cash, you will lose about 150,000 yuan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's a money-losing business. If you buy a bond worth 600,000 to 700,000 yuan and pay it, you can report it to the higher authorities for one million;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the relationship between the Holy See and the Alpha Kingdom, it is impossible to send someone to verify it. When it comes to specific implementation, how many war bonds are purchased is a matter of one sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The less loss is our net profit. Take the money up and down, and all the relationships are settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the books, the Holy See has purchased more than 10 million war bonds, and has also completed the redemption of more than 6 million bonds. In theory, Alpha Kingdom's cash flow is already very dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are so many war bonds, if they are hit all at once, the Alpha Kingdom's finances will be paralyzed even if they don't collapse immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the acquisition continues, the Alpha Kingdom realizes that it cannot hold on, and it will be a tragedy to directly turn on the bad mode and pull them into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But theory is theory after all. In Sauron's view, if the data on the books are cut in half, there is a lot of moisture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Broken ships have three catties of nails. In the context of the Alpha Kingdom desperately raising money, no matter how poor the financial resources are, they will not be killed by millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Bishop Sauron is right. To deal with a stubborn person like the Alpha Kingdom, one must beat him to death with a stick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information fed back from various places, basically after more than 20 days of application, the Alpha people will take out cash for payment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a small number of areas, the payment can be completed even seven or eight days after the application is completed. The financial strength shown by the Alpha Kingdom is far more terrifying than we imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that a large part of the cash was borrowed from major chambers of commerce. The outside world's confidence in the Alpha Kingdom is far stronger than we expected! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He does not know whether the outside world has confidence in the Alpha Kingdom, but he has no confidence in the administration of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The judgment criteria are very simple, just look at the reaction of the Alpha Kingdom. How could you be so calm if you were hit by a massive run on bonds?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that all his subordinates demanded more efforts, Pius VII suddenly realized that he was too idealistic, and he actually took it for granted that the Holy See was clean and honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you all say that, let's intensify it! Tell the people below not to go too far, if you can't produce results after a long time, hum!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse went to the ascetic camp to select a thousand people, and distributed them to various places to supervise everyone's implementation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has long wanted to rectify the administration of the Holy See. It's just that the corruption from top to bottom is too severe, and everyone boycotts the rectification, making it impossible for him to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is different. The investment of tens of millions of gold coins has not been able to bankrupt the Alpha Kingdom, and has exposed the corruption of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter was too blatant, and even if everyone present wanted to help the subordinates speak, they didn't know what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the order after order, the staff of the Holy See who are responsible for carrying out the task are also scalp numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How did you do it? The bond of one million gold coins was sent over, and the Alpha people paid it in less than seven days?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lie, make it up for me too. With so many cash reserves, do you think this is the capital of the Alpha Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think that His Majesty the Pope is far away, so you don't know what you are doing, just put the money in your pocket and say that you have completed the task!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I tell you that the inspection team from the headquarters is coming down soon. I vomited out everything I ate, and immediately went to the market to buy war bonds, and then cashed them in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't explain to me, and I don't have time to listen to your explanations. Anyway, if the Alpha people refuse to pay, the mission is not considered complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who came here this time are all ascetic monks. Don't expect any kindness to talk about. If you can't complete the task, report to the sin camp!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, all the war bonds received will be exchanged by me personally. If the numbers and accounts do not match, you will not even have a chance to enter the Atonement Camp. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One level down one level, I thought I had received a good job to make money. Unexpectedly, there was a deviation in the situation, and the exchange point set by the Alpha people did not collapse immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Bishop Montesson already hated those chambers of commerce. If it weren't for the help of these guys, where would the Alpha Kingdom have any cash reserves here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the money is sent immediately, it will be consumed quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that several major chambers of commerce have intervened. The Alpha Kingdom only needs to deposit funds anywhere in the mainland, and it can be withdrawn here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is also a time difference for this withdrawal, and timely remittance cannot be achieved. In addition, it is necessary to clarify the amount of funds remitted to various places, which cannot be freely allocated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that some places have rich cash reserves and accept exchange quickly; some places have insufficient cash reserves and the exchange time is prolonged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Montesson does not know how much interest exchange is behind this. Anyway, he knew that his dream of getting rich was shattered, and now things were very troublesome, and he had to earnestly implement the tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bundles after bundles of bonds were sent in, and boxes of gold coins were brought out. The redemption is over, but things are not over yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important public destruction work has not yet started, and the bishop of Montesson, who personally took the initiative, is staring at the actions of the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not disappoint him, sorted out the packaged bonds, and was dragged to Lutetia Square for public destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure that there were no problems, Bishop Montesson personally stepped forward to check before lighting the fire. All of them were sent in just now, and there were magic marks left by him himself on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the raging fire, Lord Montesun showed a happy smile. This time there will be no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assistant on the side had already taken out the Flowing Shadow Stone and recorded this historic scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No more tonight, no need to wait\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's just that it has not been discovered yet because it was dismantled and sold in batches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A weird scene happened. The more the people of the Holy See used the war bonds to run on them, the faster the Alpha people would pay them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, there was still a series of approval processes, but in the later stage, the office was simply moved to an open square.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For small-amount payments, all gold coins will be settled on the spot, and only when the amount is large will you have to queue up. Once the transaction is completed, the recovered bonds will be thrown into the brazier and destroyed immediately, without any hesitation in the whole process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the \"good news\" sent by his subordinates from all over the mainland, Pius VII, who was good at mathematics, finally realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The supervision team was sent out, and the people responsible for the specific implementation of the tasks also sent evidence to prove their hard work-photograph stones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with such hard work, the Alpha Kingdom, which has suffered a run on, still shows no signs of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many war bonds has the Alpha Kingdom issued to the outside world? Why have we destroyed so many and it hasn't decreased?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing question. Before taking action, the Holy See also conducted market research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the statistics of the Holy See, the war bonds issued overseas by the Alpha Kingdom are roughly between 30 and 40 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original plan was to buy 10 to 20 million bonds in batches for a run on the credit system of the Alpha Kingdom. For this reason, Pius VII was mentally prepared to accumulate millions of bonds and turn them into waste paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the plan is completed, and it has even greatly exceeded expectations, but the Alpha Kingdom shows no sign of financial collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Caesar IV repeatedly announced that this was the joint effort of all the great nobles in the kingdom, Pius VII did not believe it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles have no selfishness, how is it possible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the big nobles of the Alpha Kingdom worked together and paid out more than 30 million gold coins, their cash flow should be exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even without considering the issue of money, they have purchased so many war bonds, and the bonds in circulation on the market should be consumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is impossible for everyone to be willing to cut their meat and sell it if their reputation has not collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, according to the investigation, it was found that some nobles of the Alpha Kingdom also sold the war bonds in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    or many of the issued bonds flowed from these people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Ulisse finished speaking, everyone's expressions changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the guess is correct, isn't it that the money that the Alpha people used to cash in was given by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling that they used money to buy bonds, the Alphas took their money, took the profits and then brought them back to pay them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, everyone felt worse than eating flies. It was really bullying, and it was obvious that they were being taken advantage of!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we can't suffer from this. We must expose the matter and let everyone know how despicable the Alpha Kingdom is!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone has to take the blame for this, and it can't be them, the high-ranking members of the Holy See, or the Alpha Kingdom is too despicable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, calm down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You said that the Alpha Kingdom did it, but they did it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What about the evidence? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII reprimanded immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, these days, he finds the leader of the Blake army less and less pleasing to the eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the stability of the Holy See, he would have replaced this guy who has done more than succeed in his success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Pius VII added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have someone stamp the gold coin to verify whether the guess is correct. Before the news is confirmed, stop all payment actions.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Pius VII hesitated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the payment continues like this, the arbitrage game of the Alpha Kingdom will collapse sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the number of bonds is limited. As long as the war bonds in the hands of the Alpha nobles are exhausted, the subsequent bonds will really consume their cash flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the price paid is a bit heavy. Up to now, they have lost nearly 4 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it continues, even if the Alpha Kingdom can be defeated, how much money will they have to pay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five million, six million, seven million, eight million...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of the prepayment is constant, but the price of the bond is rising continuously. The more aggressive the acquisition, the higher the price of the bonds in circulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, the money they need to lose will also increase accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fire cannot be contained in paper. Although the Holy See has repeatedly blocked the news, there are too many insiders, and the rumors finally spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed at which rumors spread is like a fire in a forest. Once ignited, it cannot be stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, this is still a rumor mixed with part of the truth. Even though he was busy transporting bonds around, Hudson also received the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not the Holy See who leaked the news first, but the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, and the war bonds in the hands of the great nobles are not unlimited. After being burned continuously, in order to continue arbitrage from the Holy See, the kingdom could only \"borrow bonds\" from small and medium-sized nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of insiders expanded from dozens to tens of thousands, and the news could no longer be concealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the kingdom covered it up, and the people who came forward to borrow bonds were all great nobles from all over the country, and they didn't directly use the banner of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this low-level cover-up only lasted a few more days, and soon the truth was mixed with rumors and spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Looks like we should go back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a slight smile at everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, they have been out at night every day, traveling back and forth across the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the remarkable results and the spiritual comfort, everyone might have gone on strike.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money or not is not important, the key is that the situation in the kingdom has stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Caesar IV promised these people, Hudson didn't care at all, as long as his share was not missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is indeed time to go back. After suffering such a big loss, the Holy See will not let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a veteran overlord, and the number of masters in the Holy See is still the highest in the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not our territory, if they block it, it will be a troublesome thing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Magister Robert responded with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at his eager expression, as if he was looking forward to this scene. Intuition told Hudson that most of this person had a problem with the Holy See, and it was still the kind that could not be eased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's get a bargain, so hurry up and accept it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really targeted by the people of the Holy See, it is unknown whether it will be able to retreat unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make things difficult for them, then take the lead in forming the Arcane Academy to train disciples and grandchildren to fight against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will take care of the king's side, and I promise to provide you with the greatest support. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Morrison is right, Robert can do what he wants, and we all support you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are all very old, and they don't have a good few years to live. If you don't do it now, you won't have a chance to do it later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the conversation of a group of \"old seniors\", Hudson only felt that there was a lot of information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was still full of doubts, why the Alpha Kingdom, thousands of miles away, was always targeted by the Holy See, and he felt that here was a gathering place for heretics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The identities of each of these old guys present are not simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robert: Grand Magister, former head of the Kingdom Academy of Magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, one-third of the magisters in the Kingdom are all students brought out by him personally, the kind who have formally worshiped as teachers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison: Sky Knight, member of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific identity is not clear, anyway, he has a high status in the royal family and can influence the king's decision-making.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frost: Knight of the Sky, head of the Kingdom Guardian Knights, member of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Apologist Knights knew immediately that it was a subordinate institution of the Holy See, but the church institutions of the Alpha Kingdom were all controlled by the royal family and a large number of nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lambert: Sky Knight, an ancestor of the Aram family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dragon begets dragon, phoenix begets phoenix\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old ancestors were all heretics against the Holy See, and the juniors below would inevitably be affected as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a mass base, it is not surprising that Caesar III dared to face the Holy See head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Caesar IV clamored for someone from the Holy See to be crowned in front of him, so he turned around and stabbed the Holy See. It is estimated that there is no lack of influence from these old guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon Hudson figured out that the Holy See declined more than three hundred years ago. What exactly happened is not recorded in the history books, but it is certain that there must have been a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred years is a long time for ordinary people, but for masters, it may only be two or three generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the masters and elders of these old guys have participated in the anti-Holy See battle, and hatred was directly instilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hatred can be diluted by time, but it will definitely not disappear in a generation or two. Countries in the mainland are unhappy with the Holy See, perhaps the root cause is still the influence of the older generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You fellows who are half buried in the ground, how can you still be so fidgety?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can take the lead in forming the Arcane Academy, but all of you must come over as mentors, otherwise I can't hold back the anger of the Holy See. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Robert's voice fell, Hudson realized something was wrong. The \"you\" just now seemed to include him, the people who eat melons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Routine\" Proper \"routine\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a big matter can be agreed in a few words, and it is clear that there has been a blending in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the scene in front of him was specially prepared for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The theory of the same group of uncles with an average age of over 160, Hudson's brain has not yet entered the water, and he decisively chooses to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, as soon as he took a step, he was stopped by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, as one of the founders of the Kingdom's Academy of Arcane Arts, don't you have any comments?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The melon eaters became \"mentors\" and immediately became the founders of the academy. Hudson felt that the world was crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at the Arcane Academy in the Frankish Kingdom. Since its establishment, there have been frequent problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The founders, mentors, and even ordinary students of the college are all on the Holy See's hunting list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dozens of people were killed successively, including two magisters. If it wasn't for the protection of the Frankish Kingdom, they might all have died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson also had conflicts with the Holy See, those were all secret confrontations. On the surface, he is still a \"devout\" believer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has not risen to the level of \"heresy\" for the time being, and does not need to be on the hunting list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Lambert, the matter of establishing the Arcane Academy, it would be great if you seniors can take care of it, I don't know anything about it, so I won't get involved.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to support secretly, and even discuss money and effort, but it's unnecessary to go to battle in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's okay if you don't get involved, anyway, I don't expect you to do anything, but your portrait must be placed on the admissions brochure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Arcane Academy has dragon knights in charge, so we can't lose our aura! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison's perfect explanation left Hudson speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following this trend, soon there will be four major arcane academies on the continent of Aslante, just to divide up the four dragon knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether it is voluntary or not, it doesn't matter at all. It is enough to publicize it. Anyway, no one expects Dragon Knight to go to teach in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can I say no?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course you can, but when publicizing to the public, your name will still be at the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, we're just using it for publicity and won't tarnish your reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, this is a win-win thing. We have expanded our influence, and your kid's reputation has also been hyped up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the new era begins, your deeds will be indispensable when future generations learn history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe you will be named the Earl of Hudson among the future human epic heroes! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible not to be tempted by the beautiful blueprint drawn by Robert, but Hudson is a person who is afraid of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at all the epic heroes of the human race, few of them can die normally. Most people's lives can only be described as bleak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    was busy organizing the language rejection, a group of old guys forced it down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for their age and worrying about being blackmailed if something happened, Hudson really wanted to go over and beat them up\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the fight must be when these guys are alone, otherwise the one who gets beaten is likely to be himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him weak in his own strength and hindered his mount?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With the status of Dragon Knight, Hudson successfully got the title of honorary dean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest has nothing to do with him. Hudson finally understood that these old guys were really just trying to use his name, and never expected him to be on the podium.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that these old guys have a good eye for people. If you go to the Military Academy, Hudson can go over and give advice; forget it at the Arcane Academy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretical things, Master Hudson still has something in his mind, which can be shared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowledge about cultivation, this is embarrassing. As a wall hanger, Hudson's experience has no reference value other than misleading his children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show the unity of the kingdom, all the great nobles in the country have become the organizers of the Arcane Academy, and they have to set an example by sending the children of direct families into the academy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the great nobles did not know the news, it did not prevent the high-level officials of the Arcane Academy from helping them decide in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to object in the heart, the old guys who help them make decisions include their own elders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that every great noble has sent a representative, but 80% of the great nobles in the kingdom have people here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pit dug with the help of my parents and elders, no matter how bumpy the road ahead is, I can only go all the way down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people sharing the firepower together, Hudson calmed down instantly. The entire Alpha Kingdom is on the chariot, even if the Holy See settles the liquidation, it will not be so easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There may not seem to be much difference between the first Arcane Academy and the second Arcane Academy, but they are completely different in nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to suppress the Arcane Academy created by the Franks, the deterrent power of the Holy See has declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, as early as the era of Caesar III, there was already a call for the establishment of an arcane academy in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, limited by his strength, he chose to wait and see the situation for fear of attracting reckless revenge from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this wave of run-on, the Holy See has thoroughly angered the \"hawks\" in the kingdom, and the release of the Arcane Academy has become a matter of course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar IV warmly received all the returned heroes, but unfortunately, everyone didn't give him much face as the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I've grown up or I'm used to it. Caesar IV did not show any dissatisfaction with everyone's disapproval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The joint-stock country is like this. As the major shareholder of the kingdom, it is difficult to win the sincere support of the rest of the shareholders if you don't do a good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the shares are subdivided, the royal family's shares are less than 20%, while the shares held by the great nobles exceed one-third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combination of the two can complete the rule of the kingdom, and the relationship between them is more of a cooperative relationship than a mandatory constraint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, the interests of the kingdom and the interests of the royal family cannot be directly equated. The country is not the country of the king, but the country of all the nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone maintains this country together for the common benefit; it is also possible to dig the foot of the country for their own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific operation depends on both interests and integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially similar to business operations, just like a public listed company, some major shareholders are promoting the development of the company; some major shareholders use their power to seek personal gain for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Has the statistics come out yet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is in a very good mood now. It is not easy to cheat the Holy See. In the past, when there were conflicts with the Holy See, the Alpha Kingdom seldom took advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have invested a total of 8 million gold coins in cash during this run, and we have recovered a total of 31.837 million face value bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These bonds were all taken out and destroyed publicly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total real debt of the kingdom, while unchanged, has greatly increased the cash flow in our hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the contribution of the Holy See, after deducting all the costs, the kingdom made a profit of about 2 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information obtained, the Holy See still holds bonds of more than 7 million gold coins in the kingdom. Because the price of bonds rose in the later period, if they continue to exchange them, it is estimated that they will contribute one million gold coins to our profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the kingdom's huge total debt, this profit is not worth mentioning, but our international reputation has been greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Holy See stopped too quickly. If they continue, our profits can be even greater. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado said happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to be the Minister of Finance. An Alpha Kingdom in Nuo Da, in order to raise the 8 million cash, the Ministry of Finance has to find someone to borrow money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Alpha Kingdom has made money in this run, otherwise it really doesn't know how it will end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be dissatisfied, it is already very good to be able to make a profit this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See continues to toss recklessly, we can only drag them together and lose both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, we have borrowed all the war bonds we can borrow. If this bond exchange war continues, it will really consume our cash flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, the best situation is nothing more than waiting for the Holy See to hold a large amount of war bonds, and then announce the debt default. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom seems to be enjoying the scenery now, but it is actually dancing on the edge of a cliff. Once the bonds in hand are exhausted, the arbitrage game cannot continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to persuade domestic nobles to lend out their bonds does not mean that they can also persuade foreign creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The promise of \"keeping accounts\" is also valid for your own family. Outsiders are more willing to believe in a contract than an empty promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The extra cash should be used to reduce debt holdings! Especially those high-interest bonds, as long as they are collected, they will be cashed out immediately to save interest expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other respects, it is still possible to save high-ranking officials from holding huge debts, which is very detrimental to the development of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Try to repay part of it every year, and try to pay off all the debts of the kingdom within eight years. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a tragedy to think of it. His first long-term national policy since he took office was actually to pay off debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goal of \"eight years\" is not set casually. Instead, after eight years, all the debts of the Alpha Kingdom will gradually come due.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If repayment is not made in advance, when the full payment begins, the kingdom will have to be run and bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king has no idea of ​​retiring. At the age of Caesar IV, he will still be in his prime after eight years. If you want to not be responsible for passing the blame to the next successor, you have no chance to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Setting an eight-year debt repayment target also means that the Alpha Kingdom must recuperate in the next eight years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in their hearts, all the officials breathed a sigh of relief. They don't have high requirements for Caesar IV, as long as they don't mess around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lie flat, it doesn't matter. With the current system of the Alpha Kingdom, even if there is no central government, the nobles and lords can manage the place well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After eight years, the veterans of them had also completed their final mission, and it was time to give up their positions to young people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One emperor and one courtier, from the beginning until now, Caesar IV has not replaced any of the ministers, which is enough to give everyone face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, keeping the original team from the Caesar III era was a last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of insufficient prestige, if you want to maintain the authority of the central government, you must appoint ministers with high prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old officials left behind by Caesar III have a good reputation in the kingdom. A lot of things made these come forward, and the nobles everywhere would give some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a newcomer is suddenly replaced, they will not be able to gain everyone's respect before they make achievements, and they will inevitably be compared and criticized when doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, looking at the investigation report in his hand, Pius VII's face was gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thinking of exposing the sinister intentions of the Alpha Kingdom to the outside world, he also became hesitant at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See is also concerned about face. It unfolded according to the original plan. While tarnishing the reputation of the Alpha Kingdom, it is also tarnishing its own image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being calculated by the enemy for so long, no problem was found. An \"incompetent\" hat must never be taken off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the matter gets out, I am afraid that the people in the Holy See who laugh at it are no less than those who denounce the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once labeled as \"incompetent\", the Holy See's external prestige may hardly remain much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the days to come, there will only be more and more countries that dare not take them seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The news has been verified, this is the conspiracy of the Alpha Kingdom. All the run plans are cancelled, all the bonds in hand are disposed of, and losses are minimized as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This account, write it down first. When our plan to go north is launched, we will go to them to settle accounts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking about it for a while, I finally felt that it was unreliable to hold a large amount of bonds of the Alpha Kingdom for a long time, so I reluctantly chose to cut the flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the follow-up harsh words, Pius VII has let him off countless times in the past years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, everything has two sides. It seems that we lost this time, but winning or losing is always relative. If you lose to the Alpha people, you can still make up for it from other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all countries are accumulating strength, and an unprecedented war has begun to brew at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the Kingdom of Franks has formulated a strategic plan to destroy the Orc Kingdom within five years; the Kingdom of Iberia is also planning to use troops against cannibals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other countries that are close to foreign races mostly have similar plans. Except for the elves in a remote corner, who have not been targeted for the time being, other alien races have their own enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is busy looking for troubles from other races, and we can't be idle all the time. It is the duty of my Holy See to fight for the living space for the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dwarves rejected our kindness last time, so there is no need for them to exist. Destroying them just makes up for the lack of our military industry capabilities. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not the first time in the history of the human race that the sword is sharpened to a foreign race. Almost every hundred years, there will be such a time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when the internal conflicts of the human race are about to intensify, everyone will tacitly choose to provoke foreign wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war is won and the expansion of the territory is successful, internal conflicts will be eased; if the war fails, everyone will be severely injured, survival will be under pressure, and there will be no time to fight among themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is due to the battles again and again, devouring the flesh and blood of other races, that the human race has grown from weak to strong, creating the glory of today's overlord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has always been played like this, and it is no exception now. The Holy See has been silent for hundreds of years, and if it wants to return to the pinnacle of the mainland, external power is also necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to annexing a human country, it is much more comfortable to attack alien races. No matter what method is used, and no matter how ugly the eating appearance is, everyone will not care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dwarves that Blake is eyeing are undoubtedly a big piece of fat. By monopolizing the high-end arms trade, the dwarf kingdom has earned a lot of wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue that needs to be considered now is: the military strength of the dwarf kingdom is not weak, and the Holy See does not border them. If you want to provoke a war, you must find someone to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not what Blake needs to consider. He has failed in consecutive political games, and he can only look for opportunities on the battlefield if he wants to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the Judgment Knights are one of the strongest forces of the Holy See. Compared with political games, war is their specialty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a strategic point of view, it is in the best interest of the Holy See to annex the neighboring Kingdom of Ruthenia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are too many restrictions in the civil war of the human race. Even if they win a military victory, they still have to face the interference of various countries in the mainland, and it is difficult to swallow the benefits that come to their lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, it is easier and simpler to fight aliens, and it is easier to gain respect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, our relationship with the Kingdom of Ruthenia is not good, why should they cooperate with us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they cooperate with us in their mouths, when the war enters a critical moment, they suddenly stab us and cut off our logistical supplies, wouldn't it be a tragedy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my opinion, we should first look for opportunities to conquer the Kingdom of Ruthenia, put our supporters on the throne, and wait for the opportunity to launch a war against the dwarves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei immediately objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like the Judgment Knights, the Judgment Knights also need war. Everyone is the main combat faction, but it still can't change the confrontation between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though they were targeting the dwarves together, when it came time to formulate a strategic plan, the two sides still came to opposite sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Commander Gulei Army, there are many ways to solve problems in the world. In addition to military means, we can also adopt diplomatic means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In a short period of time, the Kingdom of Ruthenia formed an alliance first, and everyone joined forces to plot the dwarves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about their refusal. The current Kingdom of Ruthenia has a lot of internal conflicts and needs to be transferred externally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we propose an alliance, as long as the conditions are not too harsh, they simply cannot refuse. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This plan was discussed with a think tank in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First use a covenant to stabilize the Kingdom of Ruthenia, and after annexing the dwarves, look for opportunities to attack this \"ally\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blake, are you crazy! If we form an alliance with the Kingdom of Ruthenia, how can we ask him in the future?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei asked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Annexing one's own allies has a bad reputation. Once such a bottomless thing happens, the bad reputation of the Holy See will become completely stink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Gu Lei, you can't use old ideas to deal with problems. If we can annex the Kingdom of Ruthenia one day, the political structure of the mainland will also undergo earth-shaking changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, the small countries on the mainland have probably been carved up by everyone, entering a new era of strong countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original rule system will all be overturned, so what do we have to fear? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening quietly to the arguments of his subordinates, Pius VII fell into deep thought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Holy See did not need to start a war in a hurry, but this operation failed, and a lot of manpower and material resources were used. In the end, nothing was achieved, and a large sum of money was lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom earned two to three million gold coins, the money that the Holy See accompanied them in was not only a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Huge losses, even the Holy See can't bear it. The Holy See is not a one-person Holy See. Even if such a big thing happens as the Pope, he has to come out and give everyone an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those who have been excluded from the center of power, they will not let go of such a good opportunity to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to intensify internal conflicts, the best option is to fight abroad. No matter how much loss there is in this operation, the war can be used to balance the accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To be on the safe side, it is better to send someone to contact the Kingdom of Ruthenia first. If the other party is willing to cooperate, it is not out of the question to form an alliance with them temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dwarves are not easy to mess with, so it is right to find more cannon fodder. If all goes well, it can also take the opportunity to consume the strength of the Kingdom of Ruthenia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the future, let's talk about it in the future. At least until the dwarves are destroyed, we are not enemies! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Facing a group of old guys with surprisingly high seniority, the king used to be trained as a grandson, so he didn't stay to ask for trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there is nothing in the current Arcane Academy, let these old guys stand in front first, and it will not be too late to come and share the results after it is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"Founder of the Academy\" is not for nothing. When these old guys go to see the Lord of Dawn, Hudson, the honorary principal, is definitely qualified to become a regular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not at all shy when competing with a group of old men whose average age was over 160 years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they can break through the sanctuary, the end of life for these people is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he jumped out to form the Arcane Academy and openly confronted the Holy See. He probably knew that he would not have a good life for a few years, and wanted to lay a better foundation for the next generation before he died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The revenge of the Holy See can only scare the middle-aged people. It doesn't have much deterrent effect on guys who are half buried in the ground; it also lacks deterrent effect on young people like Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is caused by the birth environment. Taking Hudson as an example, since the first time he stepped out of the house, he has been hearing about the horrors of the Holy See, but the real events that happened around him told him that the Holy See is just like that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least within the territory of the Alpha Kingdom, it is not yet the Holy See's turn to decide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for his clear mind, Hudson would definitely be the vanguard of anti-Holy See. There are not so many reasons, it is purely to see them unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes someone to **** and pee on their neck, but the Holy See has done all these things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, the king can't do anything without them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether it is Caesar III or Caesar IV, when encountering major issues, they always discuss with the great nobles in the country, instead of labeling people as heretics at every turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, it is still a matter of \"sense of security\". Under the royal power system, the personal and property safety of nobles are guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for special circumstances during the war, Hudson rarely saw the kingdom execute nobles. As a vested interest, the sense of belonging will naturally come up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the theocratic system, everything has become different. A word of \"heresy\" can knock down a high-ranking king, let alone an aristocrat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since this uncontrollable force cannot be controlled by oneself, it must be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, these are all the big and small things that have happened in the territory in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the official document sent by Governor Pierce requesting additional labor to build the Blood Moon line of defense, everything else is going according to your deployment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob reported calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the traditional feudal lord system, government affairs are very simple. As long as the lord does not do anything, basically nothing will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same is true for the Mountain Territory, where commerce is basically negligible, and industry and agriculture are both the lord's industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territorial economy is carried out completely in accordance with the planned economy model, and all resources and labor are allocated by the Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long-term development will not be considered for the time being, but in the short term, this is definitely the most scientific economic system that can concentrate efforts to accomplish big things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The canal project has been completed, and those slaves are useless to stay, let's send them over to build the defense line!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coordinate with all parties, we will send more orc slaves in exchange for a group of serfs with rich experience in farming to help open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can also provide all the steel needed for the project, and we can find them for replacement according to what the territory needs. If not, coordinate excess labor. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a look of disgust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc slaves have made outstanding contributions to the development of the Mountain Territory, but these guys are really hard to use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to do pure hard work, but things with a little bit of technical content will make a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also opening up wasteland, the work efficiency of a human serf can be as high as three or four orc slaves. In terms of cost, it is actually cheaper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest advantage of orc slaves is that they can be used as consumables. Anyway, it is a transitional product, it is impossible to keep it for a long time, and you don't need to feel bad about dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Lord Earl. Let's go down and implement it immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this problem, the people we sent out to buy serfs also came back. The progress was not very smooth, and the nobles of the Counties of Korubia still had illusions about the Hessians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are very few nobles who are willing to sell serfs, and the number of sales is not large. Only two prodigal sons sold a large number of serfs in order to repay their gambling debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this operation, 1,586 households of serfs were purchased, a total of more than 11,000 people, and 96,794 gold coins were spent, which was far less than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, these people have entered the kingdom. According to the current speed of advancement, they are expected to arrive in the territory in two months. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Jacob's report, Hudson frowned. At present, the biggest factor restricting the development of mountainous areas is insufficient population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that there was no money to buy slaves. After the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie were established, even if they had money, they could not buy slaves. In order to increase the population, Hudson also tried his best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encouraging childbearing is a long-term policy. In a short period of time, the distant water cannot quench the near thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to think of a way in the country. The population of the kingdom affected by the war is not small, and the emerging nobles are now trying to find ways to rob people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are occasional nobles who are willing to transfer their slaves or sell their serfs, the prices are skyrocketing, and the price-performance ratio is pitifully low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson can only focus on foreign countries. After the two countries issued a joint note, he judged that the country of Cuba would be cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the lack of reaction from all parties, Hudson sent someone to buy the serfs early on. Originally, he thought that he could pick up cheap goods by relying on panic, but he didn't expect that the nobles of the Counties of Korubia had different ideas from him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's fine that the nobles of Counties of Korubia don't want to make a deal, but we can't force others to do what they want. The Kingdom of Hesse can't be busy in vain, and they will cry later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bring these people back first, break them up and settle them down. The situation on the mainland will not be stable in the future, and there will be many such opportunities in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another prophecy from God, everyone has long been familiar with it. In the past days, Master Hudson has never missed a single judgment on the general trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, after many attempts, we have initially mastered the salt-making process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, boiling salt is the main method. Limited by site requirements, the sun-dried salt process cannot be promoted for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current daily salt production in the territory is about 800 pounds, and it is in the process of expanding production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs plans to increase the production of salt to 8,000 pounds per day within this year to completely solve the problem of salt use in the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob said enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Salt is currently the biggest expense of the territory. With this problem solved, the commodity mountain territories have all achieved self-sufficiency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of everyone, the daily production of 800 pounds of table salt is already a considerable sum. But for Hudson, neither the daily output of 800 pounds nor the daily output of 8,000 pounds could move him in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a low salt output is clearly a small workshop in a town. For any saltworks, the statistical unit used is ton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well done, there is no need to worry about drying the salt method. At present, our demand for table salt is not large, and it is enough to meet our own consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the southeast province should not be in turmoil, and the cheese of the Dalton family will not be moved for the time being. After the situation becomes clearer, I will decide whether to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relocation of the shipyard, where is the progress? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Salt drying requires not only a large and flat area, but also a natural climate with less rain and high evaporation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The climate of the mountainous territory is obviously contrary to these requirements, and can form swampy terrain, which obviously has more rain and less evaporation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the salt boiling method, which is widely popular now, is more realistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the relocation of the shipyard has just started. At present, we have only completed the selection of the port and shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that construction will take another year. After the supporting projects are completed, the relocation plan will be fully launched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the development needs of the territory, we plan to transfer part of our production capacity to specialize in the production of canal transport ships and fishing boats that do not require dedicated docks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production of large ships is still put in place for the time being. I have communicated with the royal family, and for your sake, the Earl, they agreed to continue to borrow the venue for two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who are relocated now are mainly family members, some mechanical equipment that needs to be installed in advance, and shipbuilding materials that need to be stored for a long time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose's answer made Hudson very satisfied. There were many problems encountered during the relocation of the shipyard, but all of these problems have been solved, instead of pushing the problems to him, the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this does not mean that other subordinates lack responsibility. The main reason is that they have too little knowledge, and many things are beyond their ability, so they can only choose to report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the administrative capacity of the management of the Mountain Territory has been greatly improved compared to before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was two or three years ago, Hudson would have to personally go to direct any major projects in the territory. When the project is on the right track, the following talents can take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, no matter how improved, the foot of the wall still needs to be dug. Cultivating talents by yourself starts in ten years, twenty years is just right, and thirty years is the outbreak cycle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, under the political system of the continent of Aslante, the number of people who are eligible to receive education is too small, and whether they can cultivate top talents depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is not bad, because their own population is thriving, and under the leadership of Hudson, the ethnology has developed very prosperously in recent years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that's all. If you want to go further, it is a challenge to the rule system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention education for all, Hudson tried several times to enroll the children of minor nobles, but had to give up because of too much opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, educational resources are too scarce to provide education for too many people; on the other hand, there are too few positions for the ruling group, and vested interest groups oppose outsiders joining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of the mainland as a whole, it is currently in the stage of a surplus of basic talents and a large amount of spillover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the increasing number of noble children who go out to make a living every year, we can know how fierce the struggle within the noble group is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are even many descendants of great nobles who have to leave the family and go outside to seek opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the core reason why everyone unanimously opposed Hudson when he planned to expand the enrollment of ethnology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are involuntary in the rivers and lakes, and the common will of the clansmen and retainers, Hudson, a powerful patriarch, must also carefully consider it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't get everyone's support, even if it can be pushed forcibly, it will have no effect. After all, any policy needs people to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the emerging nobles are like this, it is even more impossible for the old nobles to reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since I can't complete the internal reform, then you don't want to be different, everyone must be brought to the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever dares to break the rules is a heretic, and it is right to form a group and beat them together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most typical example is Franz XIX, who is considered by everyone to be the most stupid king in the history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This unlucky boy was charged with a lot of crimes, but he actually did one big thing—establishing a government school.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, it is to encourage the nobles to take out their inheritance, establish a three-level official school from the local to the central to establish the county, province, and royal capital, and recruit the children of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, because it touched the core interests of the great nobles, it became the trigger for the collapse of the last unified empire of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the foreign races were too eager to invade in the early stages of the human race's civil war, forcing everyone to stop the civil war and unite with the outside world, the continental hegemony of the human race would have been ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, popularizing knowledge has become a taboo in the aristocratic circle. Even if it is a private transaction, it must be done quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood Moon County, since the construction of the Blood Moon Defense Line started, Earl Pierce moved his Governor's Mansion here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the defense line of the family business, and it is really difficult to make people feel at ease if they don't come and watch it in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only him, but the nobles in the entire southeastern province have kept a close eye on this line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of energy has been consumed on engineering projects, and Governor Pierce has no energy to continue doing things. He didn't even take the run on that happened not long ago as a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the message accurate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is really building ports and shipyards? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pierce asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the intelligence analysis collected before, the Koslow family is on the verge of financial bankruptcy at this moment, and there is no money for large-scale construction at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Governor, we have verified this information many times. The Koslow family is indeed building a port terminal and a shipyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from insiders, the Koslow family has invested a lot of money in these projects, and they should be preparing to do a big job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that they have also received strong support from the royal family. At present, many boatmen from the Berkshire Shipyard have relocated to the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Governor, do you think we are going to take action to cause them some trouble? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to his subordinates, Governor Pierce rolled his eyes directly. The suspicion can be pinned on the Dalton family without any in-depth investigation on the territory of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There's nothing to panic about!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson is still too young after all, and the smooth journey to the present has made him forgetful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ocean trade, not everyone is qualified to participate. We have worked hard for hundreds of years, but now we can only operate in a limited number of countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family joined in, without decades of operation, there would be no success at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just let our Earl of Hudson feel what it means to swallow gold in the ocean, so as not to be restless every day! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was still worrying about what method he would use to trick Hudson and slow down the development of the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, before he had time to do anything, the Koslow family jumped into the pit of ocean trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
