Looking at the half plaque hanging on the city tower, the barely recognizable \"Da\" character on it proves that this is his territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original big iron gate has long since disappeared. Perhaps at this moment, it has been melted in a blacksmith shop in a certain noble territory, and then cast into various farm tools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The facade looks like this, so naturally there is no need to count on the inside. It can be seen from the thick dust on the ground that this is already a dead city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he had prepared himself, the scene in front of him still angered Baron Sith. It was so deceiving that it did not leave him any hope at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not a single leader, even if there are all kinds of hills and valleys in his chest, there is no room for him to display them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are still happening in countless territories. Not only the citizens were robbed, but even the infrastructure in the territory, which could be destroyed, was also destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical detrimental to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if there are grievances between the nobles, everyone will not do things like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is different, it involves the \"big family of the Northland\", that is, new and old grudges are counted together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, Northern Xinjiang has swallowed up the lives of too many nobles. It's fine to simply spill blood on the battlefield, but most of the time it comes from internal fighting, resulting in unnecessary casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this account will eventually be charged to the Northland giants. Although many of them are wronged, no one will listen to their explanations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. The five major families in northern Xinjiang have the worst reputation in the aristocratic circle. Back then, the big merger was fun, but the reputation was permanently lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they have been working hard to clean up their crimes in recent years, they still have little success. At the very least, the aristocrats who lost their ancestral property and were forced to leave their homes would carry out the cause of the five black families to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the Dalton family is behind the scenes to fuel the flames, and it is not surprising that under the agitation of the crowd, they do some radical things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After briefly clearing the city gate, Sith held back his anger and led people into the city. Everything is as expected in the worst situation. The once prosperous Dadir City is now in ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get it, you will destroy it. You don't want competitors in the southeastern province to threaten your own status. The Dalton family has done an excellent job in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Governor's Mansion was evacuated from Dadir City, it destroyed everything that could be destroyed, and finally did not forget to set a fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All actions have only one purpose, making it more difficult for the northern nobles to gain a foothold in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the means are dirty, the effect is really good. To rebuild a territory in ruins, the manpower, material and financial resources required are not a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the nobles in the North who are not very wealthy, this expense is even more of a pressure. At the very least, the children of the nobles who went south could hardly complete the task of rebuilding the territory with the funds they carried with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to ask the family for help has become a common worry for all the noble children who went south and north. If you ask your family for help so quickly, you will lose points in front of your elders; if you don't ask for help, where will the money come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially small and medium nobles, they need to consider more issues. The reconstruction of the territory requires too much funds. Even if you open your mouth to the family, you may not be able to raise enough funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military investment of nobles in other regions may only account for 30% to 40% of their total income, and only 50% to 60% of their total income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In friendly matches with orcs all year round, there is no northern noble that does not spend a lot of money on military expenses, and financial deficits are common. Military spending far exceeds the income of the territory, which is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't go bankrupt because of financial problems, it's because they have soldiers in their hands, and they rob and **** them when they are in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think that only orcs will come to the Alpha Kingdom to rob. All the nobles in the northern border area also patronize the orc tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared with the human race, the economy of the orc tribe is much backward, and the property that can be robbed is much less. Often the most valuable property in an orc tribe is the orc itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, such things as slave traders, noble nobles naturally can't do it, not to mention their conscience. In church belief, this is hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So usually after the slaves are captured, they are thrown to the merchants to do the work for them. It seems that one more procedure can smooth out their uneasiness in conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You said that my people were robbed by soldiers?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I just wanted to find out what happened in my territory before, but I didn't expect to get such unexpected news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looting is nothing new, but it was a time of war. It is against morality to send troops to forcibly rob the people after the war. Even if the lord has not yet arrived, it is a kind of provocation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith, who was so angry, was worried that he had nowhere to go, so he sent it directly to the door without thinking of an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Kavadia taught him since he was a child that everything is imaginary, and only the strength in his hands is real. As long as there is strength, lack of anything is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a ready-made excuse, it is reasonable for him to lead soldiers to call the door to ask for an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the timing of the news is too coincidental, as if there is a black hand behind the scenes, secretly manipulating all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading troops to **** people is such a shameful thing, it must be as low-key as possible, and the participants will inevitably block the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not surprising that the local nobles can inquire about it. It is too coincidental that they, outsiders without roots, also received the news easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, Baron Sith is more willing to believe that someone deliberately let him know this news. The purpose is to stir up disputes between him and his neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make use of the topic or not is a question worth thinking about. Although he is confident in his own strength, Sith does not think that he is really invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how weak the aristocrats in the southeast province are, they are also local snakes who have been operating there for many years. If there is a fight, I don't know how many relatives and friends will come to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accidentally kick on the iron plate, it will be over for you. If Qianglong wants to suppress the local snake, the prerequisite is that he cannot be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't even beat a local snake, what are you talking about suppressing a local snake?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes kept appearing on every northern Xinjiang noble who went south. As long as there is a brain, it is more or less aware that something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make a decision along the way, constantly lingering in the minds of everyone, but still unable to make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in the face of the cruel reality, everyone's true inner thoughts can't help but lean towards \"using the topic\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Town, after receiving this appalling news, Baron Kettley also became worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other lords, his luck was worse, and he met a powerful neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the other enclaves were not too limited and far less prosperous than Maple Leaf Town, he would have wanted to change his business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he expressed doubts about the \"elite\" spoken by the nobles in the southeastern province, the cautious Baron Kettley was still unwilling to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everything else may be blown out. The stepping stone of the cavalry of the Holy See cannot be faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the soldiers in his hands were all experienced on the battlefield in northern Xinjiang, he didn't think they could be stronger than the cavalry of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps there were other factors in that victory, but it is a pity that Baron Kettley has limited information, and what he can find out is all blown out by a group of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred elites VS six hundred elites, even if the opponent's army is hydrated, it can be added the title of \"Knight of the Bow\", and the underage earth bear, Baron Kettley is still a little unconfident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an aristocrat killed on the battlefield, Baron Kettley does not lack the courage to meet a narrow road and the brave wins, but reason tells him that it is not worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the data on paper, I am at a disadvantage. Even if you can win, you will probably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the illegitimate son of the Grand Duke of Baron Sith, he just came from a middle-class noble family attached to the five major families, and did not have so many resources available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to bring three hundred elites to the south was all his painstaking efforts. In order to feed this team, Kettler ventured deep into the Orc Empire more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If for a conflict, he would wipe out the family fortune that he had worked so hard to accumulate, he would cry to death. As an outsider, there is no way to make up for the loss of soldiers and generals in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, what is the origin of this Koslow family? I seem to be familiar with it, and I seem to have heard of it somewhere.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The ancestors of the Koslow family also originated in northern Xinjiang, and they can be regarded as a middle-class noble with good strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they were on the wrong team back then, and they were unwilling to accept the kindness of the Lochnard family. In an orc invasion, he lost his ancestral land and lost his family fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Koslow family in the kingdom was established by their remnants outside, and the biggest feature is the thriving population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be that they are worried about the continued suppression of the Lochnard family. After the loss of their ancestral land, they changed the previous family gathering development model and embarked on a development path of scattered branches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In many areas of the kingdom, there are their branches, and it is said that some branches have developed to other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Koslow family is only a small family on the surface, but with the addition of many branches, its strength is not weaker than that of a middle-class noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is considered to be the area where they bet heavily, and there are more than a dozen lords, large and small. In the counties of Wright and Wyton alone, there are two baronets and two knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about the specific strength, it is difficult to find out for a while. However, this mountain baron should be the most powerful branch of the two counties. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman replied slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The apprehension in his tone is obviously against conflict with the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, who was on the side, also felt his scalp go numb. A large number of people does not necessarily mean great strength, but a large number of people must have many relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are a group that is good at grouping together, especially when facing foreign enemies, everyone is more accustomed to grouping together to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he didn't take the lead to ask for an explanation. Otherwise, who is being beaten now is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other side is strong in the first place, and if a group of relatives and friends are brought in to help out, Kettley will not be able to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wanted to be an enemy, he would have to bring together a group of northern Xinjiang nobles. Unfortunately, he didn't have that prestige. At least those who have more prominent identities in the backstage will not buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know Uncle Holman. I originally wanted to visit the famous mountain baron, but now it seems a bit inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority is to rescue the robbed citizens and restore the vitality of the territory. By the way, ask for a sum of compensation to make up for our financial hole. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not counseling, it is completely adapting to the situation. Although Hudson Territory has the largest population and is the largest fat sheep nearby, this guy who looks like a sheep is actually a bear in disguise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persimmon is weak, and if he is not sure of taking Hudson, he can only pick a weaker neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if he wants to find Hudson's bad luck, the reasons in his hands are not sufficient. It is normal for the nobles and lords to attack each other, but the reason for the fight must be sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting refugees is not morally censurable, let alone a reason to stir up disputes. Doing things forcibly can easily attract the intervention of the Governor's Office.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, don't rush to take the lead. Even if we want to do it, we can't be the first to provoke a conflict, otherwise there will be big troubles in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to send someone to inform first, if they are willing to send the person back, then it is best not to use force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As outsiders, everything we say and do will be magnified. Taking the lead in provoking disputes can easily arouse the hostility of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, this is the southeast province, and these local nobles have far more network resources than us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once caught by the enemy, it will be very detrimental to our future development. After all, the hostility is only temporary, and if you want to gain a real foothold here, you have to integrate into the local aristocratic circle after all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This nephew has behaved differently since he was a child, and he is completely outstanding among his peers. It's just that the special environment in northern Xinjiang forced him to restrain his edge so as not to arouse the fear of the five giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to go south presented itself, and without the slightest hesitation, the high-level family decided to let Kettley jump out of the cage of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this road is still difficult, but at least there is further hope, which is better than only relying on the five giants in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Holman. We should leave this kind of showmanship to our Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that some guys who are impatient have already gone to seek justice from him. As the most powerful baron among the nobles who went south from the north, he has always regarded himself as the leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a time like this, it's time for the leader to appear. Aristocrats who are evasive and lack of responsibility cannot convince everyone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he was not very convinced by Baron Sith who overwhelmed him. If he had the same resources as the other party, Ketley believed that he would not be weaker than others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there is no way. The name of an illegitimate child is indeed not good, but there are a lot of resources that can be obtained with a grand duke as my father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't know that Hudson, who had escaped a storm, was busy selling assembly line operations to craftsmen in order to increase production capacity. Apprentices are not developing in an all-round way, and everyone only needs to learn one process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you like it or not, the lord's orders are still obeyed. Although many blacksmiths agreed that this model could not produce qualified blacksmiths, Hudson remained unmoved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when weapons and armor were all made by hand, the treatment of blacksmiths was not low, even if they were cultivated by noble lords, they would also be given courtesy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is in a big city, in addition to ensuring that the family has no worries about food and clothing, the blacksmith can also have some money for drinks. He can go to the tavern for a drink from time to time, and occasionally go to the entertainment venue to indulge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many entertainment facilities in the countryside, but wine and meat can still be supplied. Among the bottom society, it is considered the best wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason for such good treatment is scarcity. In order to maintain this scarcity, the small group of blacksmiths has always retained the most primitive father-son inheritance system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, blacksmith apprentices are coolies. If you have a flexible mind, you can still learn a little bit; if you are not smart, you can only waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apprentices want to become blacksmiths, apart from working hard to steal the teacher, the most important thing is to figure it out on their own. Among them, a small number of talented apprentices can gradually become a blacksmith after countless attempts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who knows the wisdom of the people at the bottom, has never had any illusions about cultivating qualified blacksmiths in batches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he doesn't need a casting master, as long as he can knock out weapons. They are all equipped for ordinary soldiers, even if there is a little flaw, it will not hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dismantling the forging process, the apprentices were also divided into groups according to actual needs, and each group was supervised by a blacksmith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Hudson, none of the blacksmiths dared to hide their secrets. After all, they are all just learning a process, and they can't shake their status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that they are all on loan, and they still have to go back after working for a while, and they don't need to live in the Salam mining area all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the sound of knocking and knocking kept ringing. Under Hudson's personal supervision, the first batch of assembly line weapons was released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Baron, these weapons are basically unqualified, most of them have fatal flaws, and it is difficult to sell them at a good price in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at these big swords, they are all of different weights and lengths, and even the blades are not up to standard, obviously something went wrong with the quenching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at these arrows again, each one is different in size, the place that should be thin is thicker, the place that should be thick is thinner, and the round hook has changed...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is processed into an arrow, it will inevitably affect the range and accuracy of the bow and arrow, and the penetration and lethality will also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And these spearheads, made one by one...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the weapons in front of him that were sprayed **** by the old blacksmith, Hudson was not angry but happy. It's not for our own army, so why pay attention to quality!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how unqualified it is, it is still an iron weapon, which is far stronger than holding bamboo or wooden sticks as weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the aristocrats who want to expand their armaments, but their pockets are not very rich, these cheap and inferior weapons are still very cost-effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a high-quality weapon is produced, Hudson will not dare to sell it. How big a meal is there, and how big a bowl is served.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large-scale weapons production is not only an economic issue, but also a strategic issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by lack of resources, even the Dalton family can only produce weapons on a small scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family, who have a big family and a big business, will not take it seriously to make a little money by engaging in inferior weapons. After all, they can also make this thing, and they can't equip it to the elite troops, so they don't want to ruin their reputation for a little money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once high-quality weapons can be mass-produced, the situation will be completely different. It may not be so extreme to grab it directly and pay attention to Earl Pierce, who eats his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is possible to propose a land exchange, but it is a high-probability event. Now Hudson has no confidence to reject the \"goodwill\" released by the boss of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Liha, just forging according to this standard is fine. We are facing a low-end market, and the most important thing is to reduce production costs, and we don't need to pursue such high quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defective rate is a little bit high, there are still a small number of qualified products after all, which can be regarded as a surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pick out all qualified products, and package the rest after processing the appearance. After the inventory is enough to equip 5,000 people, the news will be released. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Listening to everyone's complaints, Sith, who was originally full of anger, gradually calmed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nature is so weird. When you are unlucky, you will find that there are a group of unlucky people around you, and your mood will instantly improve a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City is abandoned, but the superior location is still there. Once Wright County develops, it will still be the most suitable area for commodity trade, and its development potential will still be the greatest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Darren, calm down first, impulsiveness can't solve any problems.

Following the Grand Duke of Kavadia, what I have heard and seen the most is politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, when thinking about the solution to the problem, I naturally chose \"politics first\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for right and wrong, it doesn't matter in the world of nobles. Everyone pays more attention to the pros and cons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rational response hurt the nobles who originally wanted to encourage the Sith to come forward. Competitors are not only strong in strength and background, but they also have brains. How can they play with this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some aristocrats who were not very firm in competing for the leader position, or not sure, have already begun to think at this moment, whether they should go to the past and forget it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who can be sent out to start a new business are all carefully selected children from various families. They may be limited by the growth environment and lack comprehensive ability, but they will definitely not be fools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon he understood Sith's true intentions. It was false to live peacefully with the local nobles, and creating a reasonable excuse to stand up was what he wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For outsiders who want to gain a foothold in an unfamiliar place, the first thing to do is not to unite with others, but to show their strength first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that showing strength and standing up requires skill. If you want to gain a foothold in the southeastern province, you can't draw the hatred too deep, at least you can't push all the nobles in the province to the opposite side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Sith, the nobles in the southeastern province are very hostile to us. I'm afraid they will not appreciate your kindness, but will think that we are afraid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As local snakes, these guys have deep roots in the local area. Once we take extraordinary measures, they will definitely call for friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are naturally not afraid of the battle, the key is that we will encounter new difficulties outside the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the price of grain in the southeastern province has started to skyrocket, and it has increased by 50% compared to before we came here, and it is about to catch up with the price of grain in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prices of other kinds of daily necessities are also rising. In particular, the price of slaves has directly doubled compared to the same period in previous years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if you have noticed that the caravan always takes a detour when they see us, let alone doing business. This is very abnormal, as if someone manipulated it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the conflict between us and the local nobles escalates, this situation may become more serious, and it may even impose an economic blockade on us completely. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sutton warned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family from which he was born was engaged in logistics and finance, and Baron Sutton was extremely sensitive to changes in material prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arriving in the southeastern province, his first thing was not to rush to his own territory, but to inquire about price changes to see if there was a suitable business opportunity. As a result, the business opportunity was not discovered, but the crisis was noticed by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order of the Alpha Kingdom still exists, and even if there is internal strife, it is generally limited within a reasonable range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not dangerous for noble lords to attack each other. Even if the casualties were heavy, it was the soldiers below who died. The safety of the nobles themselves is still guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can be killed, and the territory naturally cannot be taken by force. Even if it is directly under the vassal, it cannot deprive the vassal of its territory without reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the battle without gunpowder outside the battlefield is more **** and cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of internal strife and economic blockade, it rarely happened in the past. The most important reason is: under the unique territorial economic system, almost every lord is a small industrial cycle and can basically be self-sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in fertile lands like the Southeast Province, even if they were blocked for three to five years, the nobles and lords should still eat and drink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the lords present were not good, they hadn't had time to establish their foundation yet. A territory like no man's land is unable to provide them with the most basic material support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Sith said fiercely: \"Since there is a possibility of economic blockade, then we will take the initiative to break the blockade first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who is leading behind the scenes, the economic blockade can only be aimed at us, a group of outsiders, and cannot block the local nobles at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to tear this big net, you must get the cooperation of some local nobles. According to the normal situation, they will definitely not cooperate, so the use of extraordinary means is indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to do it is up to everyone to decide for themselves. But you still have to be careful, don't push people into a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the toss is too much, they give up the fief construction directly, and spend it with us, then it will be a big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles and nobles of the North who expressed their opinions, ended in Dardir City for two days. It is worth mentioning that there was no banquet held in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this group of nobles who have added blood on the battlefield all the year round pay more attention to pragmatism than the sense of presence in the ceremony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The counterattack of the Northland nobles began, and the local nobles in Wright and Wyton counties felt the pressure instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nanshan Knight Territory, Knight Coelho, who just inherited the territory, is one of the unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was not prepared to take advantage of it. After all, his family was severely injured in the rebellion, and he had no capital to cause trouble at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can sit at home, and \"blessing\" comes from heaven. Without doing anything, a group of refugees strayed into his territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the neighbors rushing to rob people and quickly replenish the labor force of the territory, it is false to say that they are not jealous. Anyway, the refugees were sent to the door by themselves, and he didn't **** them, so they simply took them in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received more than 500 refugees, and the progress of his territorial reconstruction work has also been greatly advanced, making Coelho happy every day as if he had been injected with chicken blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the good days are short-lived after all. If you don't enjoy the demographic bonus for a few days, the owner will come to ask for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the gift in front of him, Coelho wished he wasn't home. It's a pity that the other party didn't give him a chance to refuse at all, explaining his intention to put down his things and leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weakness is the original sin, and it is not shameful to bow to the strong. I have spent more than a month of free labor in vain, and it is not a disadvantage to return it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that he only accepted 500 refugees, but the other party insisted that he accepted 1,000 refugees. After thanking him for his care with a gift, I asked him for the leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was clearly extortion, how could such a thing be compromised. But the problem is that I really can't beat it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for him, the lord who can fight, there are only a few guards left, and the rest of the armed forces are exhausted in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gather a group of serf soldiers and make an appointment with the elite from northern Xinjiang. You don't even need to start the battle, you already know the outcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One-on-one fights won't make group fights. As an aristocrat who has been rooted in the locality for many years, there was no lack of connections. Unfortunately, most of these connections were buried in the rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he was lucky enough to keep the inheritance, the current situation is similar to that of Coelho. If he can't take care of himself, how can he take care of others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed some relationships outside the county, but it is a pity that in order to successfully inherit the title, the human relationship has been almost exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that even if someone is willing to help out for the sake of friendship in the past, it will not be able to quench his thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir, why don't you ask the Knight of the Bow for help? Although you haven't dealt with them before, your aunt married into the Koslow family, and everyone is considered a relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship is a bit far away, but we are all neighbors next to each other. Just watching you being bullied like this, he can't hold back his face! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the old housekeeper reminded Coelho. It is indeed a bit reluctant to say that they are relatives, but it is true that they are relatives by marriage with the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the marriage relationship has lasted for three generations, and the parties involved have long since grown grass, and even the marriage partner is a branch of the Koslow family in Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, even if you ask for help, you should ask your relatives in Wyton County. It's a pity that the branch of Wyton is also overwhelmed now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's going to be on the shelves this Friday, everyone cheer up... Haiyue is going to hit the list, hit the list, hit the list, lovely, handsome, enthusiastic, elegant, happy readers, take all your tickets!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There are only two paths in front of them, either accept this friendship and make friends, or start a fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is only one way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it was an intelligence error or deliberately finding fault. The number proposed by a group of northern Xinjiang nobles far exceeds their actual harvest, and some even exceed the total population of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was lucky not to receive a cordial greeting from his neighbors. Obviously, the title of \"Knight of the Divine Bow\" still played a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Coelho, are you sure you didn't lead troops to participate in the robbery, and the lord of Maple Leaf Town asked you to hand over a thousand people?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not Hudson's fuss. There are enough nobles who lead troops to rob people. Wouldn't it be necessary to offend the local nobles in the two counties if they expand it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who were able to obtain fiefdoms in the land of the two counties after the war had either been fought on the battlefield, or the family's comprehensive strength was strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who inherit the family business like Cavaliers Coelho are indeed soft persimmons. But just when someone encounters a catastrophe, they come to the door to add insult to injury, and they are not afraid of being sprayed to death by saliva.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is nonsense to talk about pity for the weak and weak in the noble circle, everyone still has to put on a show on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the remaining contacts of these families, at this time they are most willing to lend a helping hand and gain a good reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the reputation, a relative who couldn't reach him and had never been contacted came to ask for help, Hudson would most likely be \"not at home\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respected Baron Hudson, I can swear on the glory of the Rex family that I never led troops to **** any of the people. Even in the past month, I have not been out of the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should have heard about our family's situation. All the elite members of the family were destroyed in the rebellion. If I hadn't happened to be out to visit my uncle, I'm afraid I wouldn't have escaped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to restore the territory after the war, I have already incurred huge debts. Now even the family's private army has not had time to form, how can they lead troops out to plunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    insisting that it has something to do with Maple Leaf Territory, that is, a group of refugees strayed into my territory a few days ago. Seeing how pitiful they were, I took them in. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Coelho's explanation, Hudson just wanted to say shit! What kind of refugees strayed in, it was clearly his subjects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I don't know which **** it was, lost people on the road, and the refugees accidentally ran into the territory of the good neighbor Coelho.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pie falling from the sky is not necessarily a good thing. Those who are weak like Coelho are stunned by the stuffing pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord of Maple Leaf Town didn't have the confidence to find someone important in Hudson, so he could only let Coelho, a soft persimmon, make up for the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is more than one unlucky person. After all, for refugees, getting lost is really normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you follow the big team, there are always people who are left behind. Especially when digging wild vegetables halfway or looking for bark to satisfy hunger, it is most easy to get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remembering that it was supposed to be his own people, but it just fell into the hands of others, Hudson felt very uncomfortable in his heart. Words of consolation, after all, could not be said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knight Coelho, if what you said is true, I am willing to act as a mediator between you and help resolve this misunderstanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, you still need to discuss the ownership of these subjects. The guys in Beijiang are used to being arrogant, but they may not buy my account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I personally suggest that you should increase your strength first. Even serf soldiers with low combat effectiveness are better than none! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to sell favors, but it's impossible to help fight, the relationship between the two parties hasn't reached that level yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific combat effectiveness of the Northern Border soldiers is unknown, but after all, they came down from the orc battlefield. If they really fought, the losses would definitely not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Cavalier Coelho in front of him looked like a poor man. He probably couldn't even pay for the burial fee. Hudson didn't want to do such a loss-making business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as a qualified arms dealer, Hudson will not give up any potential customers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobility is a relational society, and developing a customer is equivalent to developing a customer base.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the product is easy to use, everyone will not hesitate to recommend it to relatives and friends. This kind of favor without cost has always been the favorite of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Hudson, thank you for your help. Your kindness will never be forgotten by the Rex family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he only came forward to mediate, Coelho was still grateful. With the relationship between the two parties, it is already very good to be able to achieve this step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really sent troops to help him fight a battle, he, the only Rex family, would not be able to repay the debt of favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no love and hate for no reason. The big man owes a lot of favors, so he can only pay for it with his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are all low-level nobles in the kingdom, Hudson is considered a big man in front of the Rex family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host, Hudson showed Coelho a tour of his armory very enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they were all ordinary iron weapons, the dense number still greatly shocked the young knight in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, under the premise that Hudson agreed to pay in installments and offset in kind, he successfully sold two hundred \"spearheads\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's right, just the piercing tip of the spear. On the one hand, Hudson does not have so many raw materials for making spear bodies, and on the other hand, the customers are too poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a small order of two hundred gold coins, and it had to be paid in installments and offset in kind, which left Hudson speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how small the list is, it has to be made, all of which are short spearheads less than a foot long, and don't use much iron at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost is at most one or two silver coins, but the finished Hudson dares to ask for ten silver coins. Customers like Coelho who pay in installments naturally have to pay extra.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One gold coin, a proper friendly price. When the situation in the two counties is so tense, it is a favor to be able to get weapons and equipment on credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of the arms dealers in the market dared to give credit to the fief lord. Even usury merchants who dared to lend money to the king had to detour when they saw the fief lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, it is simply that the bad debt rate is too high. It's not a question of whether they want to pay it back, but that the noble lords who have come to this point have no ability to pay back at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No money means no money, so how can you do anything to a great noble because of money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the lords of the Northland have the most say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you can still receive the orc slaves to pay off the debt; if you are unlucky, the debtor may be gone at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of the heir fulfilling the contract is infinitely zero, and it is useless to go to court. There are almost no laws made by nobles: usury is legal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is credit that constrains everyone to pay back money, not territorial laws that can be formulated at will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this has little to do with Hudson. For such a small list, the debtor is still a neighbor, and the risks in it are really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The next day, two other neighbors nearby also came to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like the unlucky Coelho, they also received a friendly greeting from the lord of Maple Leaf Town.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from Coelho's misfortune from the sky, and also different from a group of nobles who led troops to rob people, they just picked up a few refugees along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the operation mode is somewhat similar to Hudson's previous practice, it is definitely not his fault. The fact that the owner has not come to the door so far has proved his character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sheep is herded, and a flock of sheep is also herded. Anyway, they are just a mediator, and whether they can reach a conclusion in the end depends on themselves. Hudson doesn't mind selling a favor three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for selling weapons, that's just a matter of habit. It's not that Hudson wants to earn their money, but to take their money and do things for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Equipped with iron weapons, even if it is just a serf soldier who has just put down his hoe, it can still have a certain lethality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attacking in an array with four or five meter spears, even if they can't kill people, they can scare many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the fight really started, hundreds of serf soldiers could at least achieve a record of 30 to 50 to 1, and if they were lucky, they might even record a record of 10 to 1 or 8 to 1.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I am the party with more casualties. After all, the enemy is the elite from northern Xinjiang, and it is not a disadvantage to be able to deal ten times or eight times the casualties and exchange the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the confidence to go to the negotiating table. If he had the strength to cause dozens of casualties to the opponent on the battlefield, that would be enough to make the Lord of Maple Leaf Town think twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from those lords who are mature and overpopulated, they can have a fight with their neighbors, and it doesn't matter if dozens of people are killed or injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a lord during the entrepreneurial period, every labor force in the territory is precious, especially the elite soldiers who have been painstakingly trained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing a few or a dozen soldiers in one battle seems to be not a big problem, but the trouble is that this is not the northern border, and they have no ability to replenish in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few hundred private troops in total. After a few small conflicts, one-tenth of the troops will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a local snake, it is not so easy to give in. Anyway, there are rules in the pk battle between the nobles, no matter what the trouble is, you can't kill the nobles privately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failing once is just the beginning, and then calling friends and finding ways to get back the field are all essential links.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the flames of war are ignited, the only way to end the dispute is to come a few more times to completely subdue the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of the aristocrats, fighting and killing are just the condiments of life, and more of it is the sophistication of the world. Smart people know how to weigh the pros and cons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Town, just made an appointment with a group of northern Xinjiang allies, and was preparing for everyone to do it at the same time, putting pressure on the local nobles, and Kettley received an invitation letter from Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, I seem to have done something stupid!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Kettler handed over the invitation letter in his hand. The full-bodied sadness raised between the brows seemed to be endless annoyance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of ordinary people, this is just a mediation document, but in the eyes of Baron Kettley, this is undoubtedly a signal that the three knights of the Salam Mountains are moving closer to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can't handle it properly, if there is a conflict between the two sides in the future, what he needs to face is one barony + three knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What made him speechless the most was: this passive situation was actually created by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending a younger brother to a potential competitor, thinking about Baron Kettley, I can't wait to slap myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was sad enough to be neighbors with the famous mountain baron, and now he sent three knights to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although judging from the invitation letter, the two parties have not really come together yet, but in Baron Kettley's view, it is only a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, I can't blame you for this kind of thing. If the territory is to develop, it cannot do without the people. Even if time can be turned back, we must do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three unlucky knights wanted to form an alliance with the mountain baron, but they had to accept it. There is a huge disparity in strength between the two sides. It is said that an alliance is actually an attachment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strength and geographical location jointly determine that these three knights must choose between us and the mountain baron. With the gap between the northern and southern nobles, even if we are willing to extend an olive branch, they will fall to the mountain baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, it is nothing more than advancing this time point. In order to obtain the labor force to develop the territory, this price is worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only troublesome thing is that the mountain baron is involved. If we want to blackmail them, I am afraid they will not easily compromise. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is an understatement on the lips, but Holman Knight is not easy in his heart. Originally, the Koslow family was difficult enough, but with the addition of three small knight families, it can be said that they completely blocked their way to develop southward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just like this, it's not unbearable. What's more troublesome is that if the relationship between the two parties cannot be handled well, even if the Maple Leaf collar develops in a different direction, it will always worry about being stabbed in the back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and Maple Leaf collar still has several enclaves outside. If it is a big noble, a few more enclaves can also be taken care of. But a small barony is not good, if you want to develop, you must concentrate the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many nobles separated in the middle, and if you want to concentrate the territory, you must exchange it with your neighbors. When it comes to interests, this kind of thing is difficult to negotiate for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This land exchange turmoil will most likely need to be resolved on the battlefield. It can be said that from the very beginning, a group of northern nobles were dug into a hole by Earl Pierce and forced to war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current burglary is just a reasonable excuse for everyone to fight. In name, they want to ask for the people, but in fact they not only want people, but also want to take the opportunity to force the neighbors to accept the land exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the military strength in their hands, most of the northern Xinjiang nobles have the strength to force their neighbors to compromise. But Ketley was out of luck, and a strong neighbor appeared to the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is naturally to defeat the disabled in the First World War, and rely on force to solve this hidden danger. Unfortunately, Ketley's strength is limited and he has no confidence to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he was like Baron Sith with 800 soldiers in his hands, Kettley would definitely not be so entangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soft sunlight swayed down to the earth, and the rushing Huanhua Creek was filled with a different charm under the autumn wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the dividing line between the Mountain Territory and the Maple Leaf Territory, the two banks of Huanhua Creek can be described as two worlds. On the one hand, the grass grows and warblers fly, birds and beasts are everywhere, and on the other hand, the serfs work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is not much harvest this season, mosquitoes are still meat no matter how small they are. For serfs who have worked with crops for generations, every grain is precious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that after starting to work, the food standard has also followed. Compared with the original minimum living rationing system, it has directly increased by more than 50%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change from 50% full to 80% full was already a remarkable breakthrough for ordinary serfs who had just experienced war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Separated by an inconspicuous stone bridge, the five lords gathered together to discuss the future development of southern Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the team formed by the three knights, Hudson smiled and nodded at them. The mob is also a soldier, and it can scare people without fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before actual combat, no one knows how much damage the 800 mob can cause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe fifty, maybe thirty, for Baron Kettley, no matter what the number is, the gain outweighs the gain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that there is the private army of the Mountain Baron on the opposite side. Just judging from the queue, the 300 troops brought by Hudson are the elite of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The uniform pace, obviously only 300 people, just stepped out of the momentum of thousands of troops, very shocking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the three hundred elites of the Northland led by Baron Kettley fell into a disadvantage in terms of momentum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two murderous teams face off across a stream. Under the cover of the murderous intent of both sides, the eight hundred miscellaneous soldiers nearby only felt uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Baron Kettley, who was still somewhat cautious, completely dispelled the unrealistic thoughts deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This lineup, this murderous look, no matter how you look at it, they are all elite soldiers. Even though such a troop appeared in the hands of a small southern nobleman, it seemed a bit abrupt, but Kettler was still more willing to believe his own eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

No one dared to risk the disgrace of the world by taking action against the other party on such an occasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson still did not relax his vigilance. The miniature bear cub lying on his shoulder was his bodyguard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly cute little guy, his combat power is not comparable to his five scumbags. The seemingly inconspicuous little claws can break a tree as thick as a bowl with one slap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the initiator of the mediation meeting, Hudson took the lead in saying: \"Welcome to the mountain leader as a guest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We were supposed to meet at a banquet, but because the territory is too simple to entertain everyone, we can only choose this beautiful place to share with you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world is called the Mountain Territory, and Hudson can only follow the mainstream, abandoning the title of Salam Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one will take the polite words seriously, and the inability to hold a banquet is pure nonsense. The real reason is that Hudson is unwilling to entertain more than a thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The landlord's family has no surplus food, so if they want to live a good life, they must plan carefully. It is a fortune to save unnecessary expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although three batches of weapons were sold, most of them were on credit. The cash he got directly was less than a hundred gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't want a banquet to consume all the funds he has managed to get back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Baron Hudson is polite, he has heard of the name of the Knight of the Bow for a long time. He should have come to visit his neighbors earlier, but there are too many territorial affairs, and he has not had time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a good thing to be able to gather by the stream today. Maybe he can also leave a legendary story for the younger generations to be sung by wandering poets. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said heartily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the territory is busy with affairs is of course nonsense, except for the 300 soldiers he brought, there is not a single living person in the entire Maple Leaf Territory, so naturally there will be no busy affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Baron Kettley is really satisfied with this meeting place. As a northern Xinjiang nobleman, it doesn't matter whether there is a banquet or not, the key is to ensure safety first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Separated by a stream, although it won't do much, at least it can protect them from sneak attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although nobles rarely lose their morals, sneak attacks on each other are the norm on the battlefield of the Northern Xinjiang people. Instinctive habits originating from the depths of his heart kept Kettley on guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two barons flattered each other, but the three knights on the side could only watch in embarrassment. The unequal status and strength make it difficult for them to intervene in the conversation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Expressing perfect intentions for each other, Hudson deliberately took a step back and said: \"The four of you are invited here today, mainly to clear up some unnecessary misunderstandings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all neighbors, and in the years to come, we will have a long time dealing with each other. Some bumps and bumps are inevitable, and there is no need to worry about some minor problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I hope that everyone can carry forward the unity spirit of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, properly handle this misunderstanding, and build a stable and harmonious southern Wrightshire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are sincere words. Although he is an arms dealer, Hudson really doesn't want the situation to collapse now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is tense and confrontational for a long time, and all parties continue to expand their armaments, so that business can continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a direct camp confrontation, and the escalation of the situation in a short period of time can indeed make a lot of money, but once the winner is determined, the business will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the territory has not yet developed. No matter which side wins, Hudson will not be able to deal with the next changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After giving up his position, Hudson acted as a melon eater, quietly watching the four of them bargaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the negotiation was on the verge of breaking down did he jump out to smooth things over so that the negotiation could continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that there is also a gap between nobles and nobles. Even if it is three Vs one, Baron Kettley has the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that throughout the whole process, no one directly threatened with force, but just grasped the noble spirit, chivalry... and other high-sounding principles, and debated with the three on the loopholes in details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no evidence of bullying on the surface, so Hudson naturally has no chance to intervene. In the final analysis, he is only a mediator and not a party, so he cannot have too obvious tendencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Four, it's getting late now. If we continue to entangle in some details, I'm afraid there will be no results until dark. It's better for both parties to make a concession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actually, regarding the differences in the number of citizens, it is not completely impossible to define.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Maple Leaf Town was a big town before, it experienced the Skull and Bones Rebellion, and the last survivors were only one out of ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Maple Leaf collar is only one-third of the original Maple Leaf Town's area, and the number of survivors can roughly be calculated based on the original registered population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that there are still two months in the middle, the population has further declined, and refugees are fleeing everywhere, plus some human factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population that finally entered the Cavaliers of Coelho, Roman, and Valov can also be roughly calculated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total number of people should be around 500 people. Even if there are discrepancies, the three knights have taken in refugees for such a long time, but they can't be busy, can they? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when talking about \"human factors\", they don't change their faces, as if they have nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this issue, Hudson is really not afraid to bring it up. He also inherited part of the land in Maple Leaf Town, and it was only natural for him to inherit part of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't paid attention to his appearance, he would have gone to his neighbors to ask for help. Of course, this kind of thing can only be thought about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson did not communicate with them, it does not mean that the Koslow family did not. Even if they are not close relatives, there is always a human relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone makes trouble at such a time, and the reputation he has finally accumulated in the aristocratic circle will be ruined all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is more than one way to obtain benefits. Compared with directly robbing people at the door, through other subtle means, these labor forces can also be used for their own use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the work of burning charcoal was outsourced by Hudson by taking the opportunity of selling weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the three good neighbors have begun to burn charcoal to pay off their debts. It has greatly relieved the pressure of insufficient charcoal production capacity in the Salam mining area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the three of them hadn't been working for him, Hudson wouldn't have gone off to give them a hand at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words fell to the ground, Baron Kettley frowned. This number is far from what he had expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Baron Kettley also knew his own territory, and there were not many people left after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when they saw that the three neighbors, Knight Coelho, Knight Roman, and Knight Valov, were easy to bully, they wanted to take advantage of the situation to blackmail them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the three soft persimmons are now hugging his thighs, making his plan unable to come true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The people of the Maple Leaf Territory scattered, not only entered the territories of the Coelho Knights, the Roman Knights, and the Valov Knights, but also entered the noble territories in the north, east, and west.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the chaos caused by the war, the exact number of people who entered each area can no longer be accurately calculated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But since Baron Hudson opened his mouth, then the number of people entering the southern region should be 500. However, the number of young adults must not be less than a quarter. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the implication, Hudson nodded along the way. Coelho, Roman, and Valov have gathered nearly a thousand refugees from the outside world, so it's not bad to keep half of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the remaining people in the three original territories, the total population is still more than a thousand people, and the charcoal production will not be greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the nobles in other areas bordering the Maple Leaf Territory, they have nothing to do with Hudson, so he doesn't bother to care about those guys' lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Baron Kettley is willing to sell him a face, Hudson is not a person who rubs his nose and face, and has to take care of everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With so many mouths, Lord Hudson, who is frugal in food and expenses, will not keep people for food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    seeing is believing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the military appearance of soldiers in Northern Xinjiang with his own eyes, Hudson finally understood why the guys in Northern Xinjiang were able to steal food from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only 300 private troops, and there are 50 plate cavalry, and even ordinary infantry are all wearing leather armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking from a distance, one can feel the rising evil spirit, obviously killing many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike the elite parallel importers brought out by Hudson, they look like a rainbow in the queue, and their running speed is also top-notch. Anyway, he has no idea about his actual combat ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All infantry, the equipment is only the weapons in hand. The number of leather armors has just exceeded a hundred, and the rest can only be counted with cloth armors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the other party is a smart person with a lot of thoughts, and he was bluffed by the magnificent momentum as soon as he came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you run into a Tie Hanhan, if you don't agree with each other, you will directly fight, the outcome is really hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson, a good archer, who could easily break through the armor of the cavalry, otherwise even if he had several times the strength of the army, he would still be unable to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three hundred veterans in Hudson's hands are not bad, although there is still some distance from the real elite. The invincible and invincible record along the way still inspired the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalier Coelho, Cavalier Roman, Cavalier Valov, the 800 mob assembled by the three workers were purely funny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less than half of them are young and strong, and the rest are old and young, and there are even women mixed in to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only a charge of fifty plate cavalry, which is almost cold, and ordinary archers cannot break through the defense of plate armor. What kind of record can be achieved depends purely on the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the nobles from northern Xinjiang went south this time, and the families behind them paid their blood. Otherwise, it would not be so easy to come up with these valuable equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I estimated that from the very beginning, I considered being in a foreign land. Soldiers lost difficult to replace the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that if all the northern Xinjiang nobles are in this lineup, the local nobles in Wright and Wyton counties may suffer a big loss this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson didn't panic, the plate armored cavalry was powerful, and it was on the plain of Yimapingchuan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Mountain Territory has only a group of small soil bags, it is still a huge trouble for the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that no one will be stupid enough to put the precious cavalry under the eyes of the \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number is small, it cannot withstand other disasters; if the number is large, you have to worry about being kited. The speed of the Earth Bear is not comparable to that of war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family is fine, but other fief lords will be miserable. The vast plains are simply tailor-made battlefields for cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that not only ordinary broadswords and spears will be produced, but also extended versions of spears, war knives specially designed for cutting horse legs, and even war hammers and giant axes must be prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering plate cavalry, it is obviously more suitable for these heavy weapons to play. Even if you can't achieve your goal all at once, you can do it a few more times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, everything has two sides. The elite division is indeed strong in combat effectiveness, but the cost of feeding is also high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary serf soldiers can take care of food, as long as they can eat enough, they can fight wherever the lord directs. The elite troops not only have to take care of food, but also have to eat well. If the nutrition can't keep up, it can't guarantee the combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Participating in the robbery has to be shared, and rewards have to be given for military exploits. If these tasks are not done well, there is no way to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm for fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way back, Baron Kettley, who was also shocked, secretly thanked himself more than once for being safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troops that are uniformly adjusted step by step are rare in northern Xinjiang. The troops that can do this are all the best of the best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson's command is all infantry, Baron Kettley also dare not underestimate. Because he had witnessed with his own eyes how an elite infantry tortured orc wolf cavalry together on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, we must speed up. Taking advantage of the moment when we have just reached a tacit agreement with the Mountain Baron, we will immediately take extraordinary measures against the other companies, so as not to delay too long and cause new troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family can train a super infantry elite, so what about other nobles with deeper backgrounds?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is not an isolated case, but we underestimated the strength of the nobles in the southeastern province. After all, in terms of financial resources, they far surpass us in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to pay, spending money can also produce elites. Even if the combat power is not as powerful as the private army in the hands of Baron Hudson, it can still catch up with ordinary elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't take advantage of them before they react, and create an established fact first, and then don't know how many people will come out to mediate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to continue selling face, but what about the future development of the territory? We can't even feed our army without enough people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to have a clear mind. If you are not in charge of your home, you will not know that the expenses in daily life are high. If you want to support the three hundred elites in your hands, you can't live without three or five thousand leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is only a theoretical state. In fact, the expenses of a nobleman are far more than just military expenses. Daily communication and human relationships are all gold swallowing beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have more children, the cost will be even greater. Daily practice, weddings and funerals are all expenses that are not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to live together regardless of the family. If the eldest son inherits the family business separately, you can't watch the second sons go out to eat chaff and swallow vegetables, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang nobles keep more soldiers, because facing the threat of foreign enemies, they can only resort to militarism, and they don't care about the so-called noble face at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's economic conditions are not abundant, so naturally everything is kept simple in daily life. Not only is daily communication and human relationship exchanges compressed, but even weddings and funerals can be saved if possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nobles in the southeastern provinces gave up their luxurious and comfortable life and followed the nobles in the northern borders to engage in militarism, it would take a few years for their military equipment to be improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accidental misunderstandings affected Baron Kettley's misjudgment of the strength of the nobles in the southeastern provinces, and also accelerated the progress of the robbing war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before, the local nobles looted the fiefdoms of the northern nobles, and now the situation is just reversed. The local aristocrats who originally had the upper hand quickly fell into a disadvantage in the head-to-head military struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the two counties of Wright and Wyton were full of gunpowder and smoke, and countless local nobles were unfortunate enough to become captives, waiting for their families to pay the ransom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the Koslow family has also been affected, the unlucky ones are not the Baron Berio and the Guarente Knight who have just inherited the title and are in a weak period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were too law-abiding and did not follow the trend to join the robbing war. Coupled with the strong support of the family, they have not been involved in the storm for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead, Adrian Knight, who was doing well, was severely beaten by the society and was taught how to be a man by several neighbors. It was all caused by too much tossing around in the past, but now it's just a feng shui turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, as the younger brother of the Dalton family, the boss has ordered that Adrian Knight must act as the vanguard against the nobles of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before, because of the Dalton family, he obtained the fiefdom; now because of the Dalton family, he has been beaten by the cruelest society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if you want to say how miserable it is, it is pure nonsense. At the beginning of the matter, Adrian was ready to suffer the backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population that was robbed earlier was not brought back to the territory at all, but was transferred to a family branch two counties away for foster care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the population was transferred, but even family members, property, and the army in their hands were also placed outside. After the conflict broke out, only Adrian Knight and a group of old and weak were in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian Knight, who was directly rotten, seems to have been beaten by the cruelest society, but the actual loss is minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang nobles came to him, and he consciously became a prisoner. However, Adrian refused to admit the matter of leading troops to rob people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is aristocratic, and torture cannot be used to extract confessions. Even if he becomes a prisoner of war, he must be entertained with good wine and good meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory is full of old and weak people, there are only a hundred and eighty people in total. If he said that he led troops to rob people, he had to show evidence!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the nobles in northern Xinjiang are, they have no way to cross regions and go to other branches of the Koslow family to find evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Knight Adrian has not realized as a captive at all. Not only should he eat and drink, but he also keeps asking the nobles of northern Xinjiang who captured him for an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson admitted that he was the one who came up with the bad idea. In order not to involve the Koslow family in the turmoil, and to explain to the Dalton family again, this is the best way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just never expected that Adrian Knight would be so good at playing. Everyone let him go, and promised not to pursue the previous matter, and he still insisted on not leaving, wanting to seek justice for his tragic experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's true that he lost his face, but he does have the capital to make a fuss now. It was originally the party that made the trouble, but now it has become the victim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for Hudson to worry about the following things, and even the Koslow family can pretend to be deaf and dumb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all the nobles in the southeast province are watching.

There is no living person in the territory, and who has the time to care about the enclave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the enclave problem is to be solved, a certain economic foundation must be established. Now it's no man's land, so there's nothing to argue about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blame the younger brothers for doing bad things with good intentions?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce is not that stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the younger brothers have mixed abilities, but at least there is nothing wrong with loyalty. As soon as the boss gave a hint, he came out to charge without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not possible to pull all the local nobles into the water, but it also pulled dozens of families in anyway, so it can't be regarded as a complete waste of work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hatred can be piled up. It seems that it is just bullying a noble family, but in fact it offends the circle behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't get involved because the interest is not enough. Everyone teamed up to beat up the nobles of Northern Xinjiang. Apart from letting out a breath of anger, they couldn't get more benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if people are driven out of the southeastern province, the Dalton family will benefit the most. This is the fundamental reason why everyone chooses to wait and see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Adrian cannot be counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He worked his hardest when he was robbing people, and shouted the loudest slogans before the fight started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that this product could drag the Koslow family into the water, but he made such a toss, and got the cheap Koslow family. Standing on the shore, it was too late to have fun, so how could they jump into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that as long as your backstage is strong enough, even if you just show off casually, you can still make your opponent's scalp numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, failing to get the desired statement from the northern Xinjiang nobles, they confidently brought the lawsuit to the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that Earl Pierce doesn't know whether to reward him or arrest him and scold him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Pass down the order to implement the second set of plans, first give a warning to the guys in northern Xinjiang, let them know who is the master of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify all the fief lords in the two counties that I will go to Dadir City in person in ten days to mediate the latest dispute. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order of the kingdom is still there, and the duties of the governor must still be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is okay to fight in secret, but once it is put on the table, you must abide by the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attacking noble territories without reason is strictly prohibited by the kingdom's laws. If the rules can be trampled on wantonly, how can the small and medium nobles feel safe?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, or the ruins of Dadir. After some simple repairs to the city by the serfs brought back, Baron Sith finally had a place to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the northern Xinjiang nobles who went south, Sith was already the best. Other nobles are still cleaning up the ruins of the castle, and he has already moved into the City Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially by leading a group of northern Xinjiang nobles to launch a counterattack and retake the achievements of the leaders, the prestige in the group is also rising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many people who are famous and gossip. After a few days of good times, troubles come to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lawsuit of the Governor's Mansion is nothing, it's just a matter of wrangling. Although he suffered a dull loss, the actual loss was not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No serious consequences were caused. It was nothing more than asking the younger brother involved to apologize and promise never to do it again. At most a symbolic loss, just as a lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the loss of face, the pragmatic northern Xinjiang nobles still pay more attention to the inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Sith, we are here to ask you for help. This day is really impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon after the counterattack was launched, prices began to soar. I thought it was because of the tense situation that profiteers deliberately drove up prices, but I didn't expect prices to soar even more after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of rye soared from three coppers a pound to seven coppers; peas rose from two coppers a pound to five coppers; To a silver coin per pound...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, all commodity prices are skyrocketing. One price in the morning and another in the afternoon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arguing with those guys, I didn't expect that those profiteers didn't show any face at all. They looked like they would buy what they wanted, and they would mock me as a barbarian in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a fit of rage, I ordered the arrest of these guys. As a result, since then, no caravan has entered my territory...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of the latter, this iron-blooded man almost cried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really bullying the nobles too much. Such an arrogant businessman is rare in the entire continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For nobles, the face is as big as the sky. If they are both nobles, just say a few words to each other. Mere merchants dare to do things, that is to suspect that the sword in their hands is not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they do nothing on the surface, they will retaliate secretly. A large part of those caravans that disappeared for no apparent reason were black hands of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Sith and Knight Daeron are telling the truth. These merchants are too arrogant, and they don't take us seriously at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are prices being driven up, but the quality of the products sold is getting worse and worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, profiteers at most mixed some old grains with new grains; now it is a miracle to find a grain of new wheat among old grains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at this bag of wheat, you don't even need to use it to grind flour, it turns into flour after shaking it…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Justin Knight, don't embarrass Baron Sith. We have all encountered this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can tell you the truth, not only the prices in Wright and Wyton counties are skyrocketing, but the prices in the entire southeastern province are also skyrocketing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, this round of skyrocketing prices is just a skyrocket for us. Local aristocrats can still get cheap goods by virtue of their connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the prices of other commodities rise, we can still find ways to reduce consumption, but food alone cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more troublesome is that this is just the beginning. The next thing we need to face may not be the question of whether the food quality is good or not, but whether we can buy enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I spent a lot of money to buy a grain merchant, and learned an amazing news from him—the nobles in the southeastern province are likely to stop selling grain to the outside world this year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Bazel said surprisingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I knew that the local nobles were not soft persimmons, but I didn't expect their revenge to come so hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly lead troops to fight over, and everyone will not hesitate. But as soon as you come up, you will run out of food, so how do you accept it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally winning a counterattack, it was supposed to be a time to celebrate the victory, but the happy event turned into a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the lords of Northern Xinjiang, the people in their hands have become a hot potato. The larger the population of the territory, the faster the consumption of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the inventory in hand is exhausted, everyone will be hungry. It is the sacred duty of the lord to feed the people, and there is no way to shirk it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being announced the answer first, Baron Sith felt a little uncomfortable, but there was no change on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Baron Bazel is right, a group of local nobles in the southeastern province are indeed showing signs of blocking us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that in recent days, everyone has been tossing too hard and offended too many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price hike this time was caused by the families behind these guys secretly connecting together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Dalton family must be contributing to the flames, and it is even possible that they are the real behind-the-scenes masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose is to drive us out of the southeast province. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Otherwise, it is not a skyrocketing price, but a more extreme disappearance of business travel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's one thing not to drive them away, but it doesn't affect everyone taking advantage of the chaos to make a fortune. The so-called blockade is only because the interests are not big enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When prices soar to a certain level, someone will naturally break the tacit understanding and do business with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like the northern border area, Mingming Kingdom repeatedly ordered to impose an embargo on the orc empire, but in the end, a large amount of materials were smuggled there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Does the king know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That must be known, but the embargo still has to continue. Because under the embargo, the cost of obtaining materials for orcs has been raised many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategically, the blockade is still successful. Because the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom do not do these businesses, other countries will do them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, when the Alpha Kingdom was fighting against the Orc Empire alone, the material embargo was much more successful than it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I dare not say that no materials flow into the hands of orcs at all, but the smuggling of strategic materials basically does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the military chiefs guarding the border at that time were all fief lords, and no one was willing to hand a knife to the orcs and let them come and chop themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is facing the same situation as the Northland, except that they have changed from the smuggling side to the blocked side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using oneself to judge people, the nobles of northern Xinjiang did not think that the nobles in the southeastern provinces had such high integrity that they did not even make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crux of the problem is—how much benefit do you need to pay to feed this group of ground snakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing, union doesn't make any sense. Everyone is an old player, and many of them have even witnessed the scenes of orc tribes scrambling for supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As supply and demand shift, allies can also become competitors. As the titular leader, Baron Sith, naturally wanted to change all of this, but he also couldn't change the materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Grand Duke Kavadia has a famous name, this is the southeastern province, and the influence is likely to be negative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't use this banner, and everyone can still pretend to be confused; once the banner is displayed, those nobles who have enmity with the Felix family may come to the door one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Although the world of nobles is hypocritical, there are still some principled issues that must be persisted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith didn't want to know how many feuds the Felix family had in the past endless years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is only an illegitimate child, he cannot inherit the glory of the family, and naturally there is no need to inherit the hatred of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's stop here for today! In a few days, Governor Pierce will come to Dadir City to mediate the dispute between the two counties, and then we can negotiate with them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After comforting his younger brother, Baron Sith, who was physically and mentally exhausted, rubbed his forehead helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he even wanted to give up his position as the leader, but in the end he couldn't make up his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the son of Grand Duke Kavadia, while enjoying many resources, he must also undertake corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now retreating, not only loses his own face, but also the face of Grand Duke Kavadia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is only an illegitimate child, since he was pushed out by Grand Duke Kavadia, he represents the face of the Grand Duke to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith can bow his head in front of more prominent nobles, but he must not bow his head in front of the retainers of the five wealthy families in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Baron Hudson, who had just adjusted his production tasks, received a notification from the Governor's Mansion before he had time to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, the opportunity to make a fortune has come. The gathering of nobles from the two counties was a rare prosperity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many high-quality customers gathered together, if a market cannot be developed, then there is really no way to mix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially weapons and equipment must be promoted. Being so stimulated by the nobles of the Northland, if the nobles in the two counties can't roll up, they can really be eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, Lord Ketterley is visiting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid's voice interrupted Hudson's plan to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, take him to the living room to rest for a while, and I will be there later.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this neighbor, Hudson doesn't have much thought. Where his strength lies, it is simply not what he can plot now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the faction you belong to, it is not appropriate to make friends with it. At least until the Northern Xinjiang nobles and the local nobles eased the relationship, the best way to get along was to stay at a respectful distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two have never had any friendship. Even if they had a happy conversation during the last mediation, it was just a \"business need\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson needs to be known as the \"Knight of the Bow\" among the nobles in the northern border; Baron Kettley also needs to brush up his presence in the camp of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coincidence and coincidence, the two smart people took advantage of the trend to have a wave of business bragging, and in essence, they each got what they wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's over when you blow it off, and it's too much if you take it seriously. This uninvited guest suddenly came to the door now, and Hudson really didn't understand what he wanted to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The visitor is a guest, and etiquette cannot be lost. After a brief wash and a change of clothes, Hudson went to the cabin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the construction of the castle is far away, so we can only build a few cabins to cope with it. The pioneering nobles are so miserable, there is nothing to be ashamed of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nodding acquaintance, there is nothing to talk about. After a few simple greetings, they began to get straight to the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, if you want to buy food, why don't you go to the grain merchant?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you think they are too dark, you can also go directly to the nobles in the neighboring county to buy them. The southeastern province is known as the granary of the kingdom. Almost every lord and noble has a large amount of food in their homes, and you will not be disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I moved into the territory more than a month earlier than you. Everyone's situation is similar. Last season's grain harvest was almost complete, and this season has just started sowing. Where can I sell the grain? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's shameless answer, Baron Kettley almost vomited blood. If the nobles in the neighboring counties are willing to sell grain, will the prices soar?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to raise food, all the northern Xinjiang nobles also showed their special skills. Some people bribed the grain merchants, some bribed the lords and nobles with a lot of money, and some even targeted the free people, but unfortunately, all of them had little effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the food rationing in the provincial capital Beida City has been rationed. Residents, taverns and hotels can buy cheap food according to the quota every day, and there is no extra grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite all their efforts, the nobles of Northern Xinjiang were not able to deduct much food. It's not that the merchants don't want to sell, it's because the boss at the back ordered not to sell the grain to the northern Xinjiang nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autonomy of the nobles is much higher, but when the northern Xinjiang nobles came, they were so powerful that they made everyone feel uncomfortable. Recently, they have been rivaled on the battlefield, which has even made a group of local nobles lose face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The face lost on the battlefield must be found a way to get it back, at least let everyone take a sigh of relief first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for money, except for the nobles who need to open up new territories, and the family's economy is a little bit tight, most of the fief nobles are still not in short supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who lack money have no food to sell; those who have food have no money in their pockets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that these feudal nobles can't be bought, but just eight hundred gold coins is not enough to make them let go of their principles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, food is a necessity. If you don't want to go hungry, the nobles in northern Xinjiang must buy it. The longer the delay, the higher the food price will be, and they will only earn more, and there is no rush at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To be honest with Baron Hudson, it may be because of some unnecessary misunderstandings that no one is willing to sell food to us now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is really no other way, so I came here to bother you. If you are willing to help with purchasing, I think everyone will not refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price, you can rest assured. Just follow the current market price, and I will never bargain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately's heart was bleeding when he said this. The current market price has exceeded twice the normal price, and is much more expensive than the grain in the northern frontier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now he took the initiative to deliver it to the door, begging someone to kill him, and worried that he would not do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm sorry, Lord Kettley. As a principled nobleman, I can't do this kind of deceit, so there is nothing I can do about it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are really short of food, you can consider buying from outside the province. Anyway, it's only a few hundred miles away, and it won't take long to transport it with my own hands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said nonsense solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds completely fine, but if you really want to implement it, it will break people down. Whatever others might think, Lord Kettley was unwilling to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from the Northland, he dared not forget how many stares he suffered along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the hatred was brought down by the five major families, their younger brothers are also accomplices, and there are many nobles who are unhappy with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the group action, it is still unknown whether they can reach the territory smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out to buy food at this time is not forcing people into trouble! Anyway, it is all expensive food, it is better to buy it from the local nobles, at least it can ease the relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, Kettler didn't want to choose the difficult Hudson as a breakthrough. Unfortunately, among the local nobles, he was the only one who could speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the neighbors were all offended by him because of the problems of the people. At this time, I went to buy food from others, and I knew the result without thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the nobles in neighboring counties, Baron Kettley has already visited them. It's a pity that the ending was very touching. After a dozen rejections in a row, he really didn't want to continue looking for abuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Baron Hudson joked, even if the food from outside the province can be brought in, it will be too late in time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of people in the territory are now starving for food. Once food is cut off, it will be another human tragedy. For the sake of the Lord of Dawn, please extend your helping hand to save the poor citizens! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said excitedly. It was as if he was really desperate and had to put all his eggs in one basket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Lord of Dawn really doesn't have much face in front of Hudson. Counting on the face of the Lord of Dawn, it would be more effective to throw a few boxes of gold coins over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the benefits are large enough, the rations of thousands of people is not a big problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Baron Kettley is obviously not at the end of his rope. Because of the style of the nobles in the north, if it was time to put all their eggs in one basket, they would always lead the army to act together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't buy food, can you still get it? When a person is hungry, he can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, you don't have to worry too much about the people in your territory. If you are unable to take care of so many people due to lack of food, you can still ask your neighbors for help!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your territory is short of food because of too many people. Let everyone help share a little, and the problem will not be too big. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a bit immoral to take advantage of the fire and rob at this time; but the current interests, I really can't care so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson doesn't become the villain, someone else will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is now the consensus of all local nobles to weaken the strength of the northern Xinjiang nobles. Until they reach their goals, they can't think of a good life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the acquiescence of the local nobles, even if they did buy food from outside, they would not be able to bring it in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, many nobles have announced an increase in the commodity transit tax. For all commodities shipped to the noble territories of the Northland, the tax will be doubled and doubled. Some lords even directly announced 99% in kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance is all confiscated, and it is actually almost the same. If nothing else, many of the products they ordered will not arrive for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, don't you think it's too much to make such a request to a noble lord?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If eyes are knives, Hudson is already covered in bruises. It's a pity that eyes are eyes after all. Although Baron Kettley's force value is slightly higher than his, this is a mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please stay calm, Lord Kettley!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is smart, and there's no need to hide it. You probably understand why what happened now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you first came, although everyone didn't welcome you very much, they didn't target you very much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with taking back the territories that belong to you. But the problem is that your appetite is too big. Not only did you take back the citizens of your own territory, but you also snatched away the neighbors'.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention other nobles, the current number of citizens in Maple Leaf alone has exceeded 6,000, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can do the math.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Town is one of the important agricultural towns in Wright County. Before the outbreak of the Skull and Bones rebellion, the population was more than 18,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf collar inherits one-third of the area of ​​Maple Leaf Town, and the population in its heyday is estimated to be more than 6,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't tell me that the Maple Leaf collar is completely unaffected by the Skeleton Society rebellion involved in the two counties?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you do a little research, you will know that a large part of them are not locals, but the original lords migrated from neighboring counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, a certain unlucky baron has relocated half of the population of the knights, but now there are not many people in the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson broke through the road unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles indeed restrained their desires, but only caught the scourge of leading troops to rob people before, and did not arouse public anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that they played too hard, and even the root of the leek was planed by others, just like the guys before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Double standards exist everywhere. The local aristocrats did it, and everyone didn't think it was a big deal. The northern aristocrats followed suit, and everyone immediately became upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combination of many factors has led to the current situation. If Baron Kettley hadn't delivered it to his door, Hudson would not have gone to this muddy water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because these people who migrated from abroad are too difficult, even if they get it, it will be difficult to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many people do you want?\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But it's not about committing suicide, it's about killing the vampire in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just the unfamiliar surroundings that made him let go of this tempting idea. Turning your face on someone else's territory is definitely looking for a beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson, your appetite is too big. I just need a batch of emergency food, you are digging my roots! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he got up and was about to leave, Baron Kettley regretted it. Half of the population is not negotiable, as long as there is enough food in exchange, then everything is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, losses can also be passed on. Now all the nobles in the north are short of food, and it is not impossible to exchange population for food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To go or not to go?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Baron Kettler sat back down again. Although face is important, survival is even more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going south from the north, he has placed all the chips. If you can't gain a firm foothold in the maple leaf collar, all your efforts will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family resources are limited, and it is impossible to continue investing in losers. If he failed once, he would have to work for the family to pay off the debts all his life, just like the Holman knight who followed him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't refuse in a hurry, listen to my offer first. One hundred and fifty thousand pounds of rye + two hundred thousand pounds of miscellaneous grains, for the sake of old friends, you can also give an extra ten iron pots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a similar business, you can also introduce it to me, and you can get 10% of the benefits. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said \"old friend\" one by one, which made Baron Kettley's scalp tingle when he heard these three words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called friendship is worth ten iron pots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking about the relationship between the two, it seems that it would be good to discount it into ten iron pots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for introducing business, Baron Kettley ignored it. This kind of **** business, no matter who it is introduced to, is an offending business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just 10% of the income is not enough to make him let go of his prejudices and attract customers for the vampire in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Hudson, such a price is simply a steal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately suppressed his anger and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On average, each labor force can only be exchanged for more than 100 pounds of grain, most of which are miscellaneous grains. In normal times, the price would never exceed 3 silver coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't rush to get angry. The most important thing in a person is contentment. Only when you learn contentment can you have a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at it another way, this is a costless business. Now that half of the population can be left, and so much extra food can be exchanged, what is there to be dissatisfied with?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget the current situation, Governor Pierce is coming to mediate. The things you have done before are not impeccable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you dig into it, you will definitely find omissions. Among other things, you can't give a reasonable explanation for the population alone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say more than 6,000 people, even if you cut half of it, you can handle it, it's considered luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The explanation is not clear, when the time comes to investigate, can you really keep so many people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than being forcibly confiscated by the Governor's Mansion, it is better to trade them out in advance, at least to get a batch of grain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing people is also a technical job. Although his words are alarmist, the intervention of the Governor's Office is indeed very detrimental to the nobles of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When my younger brother is being bullied, it is self-evident which side the boss will stand on. It's fine if you can't catch the handle. Once the problem is found out, Earl Pierce will most likely be severely punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson, knowing that this is the final bid and not negotiating with him, Kettley sighed helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all, just do as Your Excellency the Baron says. But I don't want any accidents to happen next!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Baron Kettley's heart was bleeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Working for more than a month, he offended the neighbors all over the place. As a result, Hudson only paid \"150,000 pounds of rye + 200,000 pounds of miscellaneous grains\" and took half of the spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he didn't even have the confidence to refuse, the food in the territory was about to run out, the serfs were croaking with hunger, and people fled every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If food is no longer available, even the soldiers will have to starve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't really go out and grab it, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transaction can still save half of the population, and quickly replant some crops with a short growth cycle, so that the food in exchange can be saved and can last until the harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lead troops out to rob, the suffocation in your chest will come out. Once a rebellious hat is buckled, there will be no end to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Baron Kettley. My reputation is well-known throughout the southeastern province, and nothing that will damage the honor of the nobility will definitely happen.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson assured calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of credibility, he is indeed impeccable. Just ask those nobles who have worked with you, and there is nothing bad to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to reap the rewards. Lord Kettley would not have come to him without a good reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deal was concluded and Hudson was still a little disappointed as he watched Baron Kettley leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to take the opportunity to sell some by-products, but Baron Kettley's temper was too eager, and he left immediately after talking about the matter, unwilling to stay for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is no rush for this kind of thing. It is not worth rushing to the door to do business in an exclusive monopoly business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the two counties of Wright and Wyton, his family can produce ironware on a large scale. Looking at the entire southeastern province, Hudson is also the largest supplier of ironware.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The era of lords everywhere is not suitable for the development of commercial logistics. The endless tolls along the way alone can block foreign goods out of the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal for the price of the same product to vary several times in different regions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder that the nobles exploited so hard, it was all stimulated by the tax package system. The governor is responsible for the taxation of the whole province, the sheriff is responsible for the taxation of the whole county, and the noble lords below are responsible for the taxation of their own territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you entrust it to others or collect it yourself, anyway, after making up the figure stipulated by the kingdom, the proceeds will be yours. If you can't complete the expropriation task, you can only fill the hole with your own money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats in remote areas are poor, largely because there is no commercial tax to collect in the territory, and there are no free people to exploit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, losing money is a small probability event. Although the tax package system is implemented, the tax standards of each region are formulated according to the actual local conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Wright and Wyton counties encountered the Skull and Bones rebellion, and they were tossed out of ten rooms. The kingdom exempted the tax for the past three years, and it will also be able to reduce taxes in different amounts in the next ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are gradually perfected after a long period of games between the kingdom and the local nobles. Maybe there are some areas that take advantage of losses, but on the whole, the interests of all parties are taken into account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a shareholder and enjoys the dividends of the kingdom's development. As for the other classes in the kingdom, they are all laborers who depend on the nobles to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Canglan City, Emerald Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What did you say? Earl Frodo, was attacked outside the city of Rockdia, and none of the entire mission survived?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the king's envoy, Earl Frodo represented the royal power outside, and now he was killed in the kingdom like this, which is clearly a provocation to the royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing cannot be tolerated by any monarch, let alone a promising lord like Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Majesty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The location where Earl Frodo was attacked was twenty miles outside the city of Rockdia. By the time the nearby nobles rushed to the rescue, the battle was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the enemy destroyed the scene, we still found some dragon feces during the investigation around the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the mainland, there are only a few forces organized by flying dragon cavalry, and the only one that has entered the kingdom recently is the second flying dragon cavalry regiment under the Holy See Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the inside of the Holy See, their mission this time is to take away the Blood Moon Horn at all costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very likely that after Earl Frodo obtained the Horn of the Blood Moon, he accidentally leaked the news, making them choose to take the risk. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland analyzed solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the prime minister of the kingdom, he is old. Now I just want to spend the rest of my term safely, but I didn't expect trouble to come to my door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See intercepted and killed the king's special envoy. If the Alpha Kingdom didn't respond, how would they be able to hang out in the continent of Aslant?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Kingdom takes retaliation, the already tense relationship with the Holy See may be completely over, and it may lead to a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Alpha Kingdom is not afraid of war with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the patron saint of the human race, the Alpha Kingdom, which has stood on the front line against the orcs for many years, is not weak. Even if the strength is not as good as the Holy See, the gap between the two sides is not so huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a big force, everyone has their own concerns, and no one wants to be taken advantage of by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are several countries in between. Even if the Holy See wants to call, they have to ask others to borrow their way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this cannot happen. The countries on the mainland still need the Alpha Kingdom to block the orcs' advance, and they will not let the Holy See fight over at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many reliance on it, so the Alpha Kingdom has always been known for its toughness when it comes to dealing with the Holy See. To be exact, the Alpha Kingdom has never been soft on any side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to stop the flying dragon cavalry of the Holy See. Before the matter is investigated clearly, the Kingdom prohibits any member of the Holy See from entering or leaving. Anyone who resists will be killed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to freeze all the property of the Holy See in the kingdom, and deal with it after the matter is investigated. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he was really irritated. The matter of the blood moon horn has not yet been settled with the Holy See, and now there is another incident of intercepting and killing the special envoy, which clearly does not take the Alpha Kingdom seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the matter is verified, no one knows what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is reasonable to detain the flying dragon cavalry, but is it an overreaction to freeze the Holy See's property?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland hastily persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dispute between kingship and theocracy has not been a day or two, but everyone has always maintained the principle of fighting without breaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if countries have separated their domestic churches from the Holy See, they have nominally retained their affiliation with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Excessive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't see it that way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The guys in Northern Xinjiang have become restless recently. They are jumping up and down and stretching out their hands, and they are not afraid that the next time the orcs invade, the nobles from all over the place will stab them with knives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the internal conflicts in the kingdom, the Holy See is not a threat. It's just a temporary freeze of their property, and it's not directly confiscated, but at worst it's a war of words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because they supported the cult to launch a rebellion, Pius VII did not have the confidence to bring it to the table. If the matter of intercepting and killing the nobles of my Alpha Kingdom is real, do you think the Holy See really dares to let go and make trouble with us? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quickest way to divert internal conflicts is always to provoke external disputes. The Alpha Kingdom is professional in this regard, and Caesar III is an expert among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there have been frequent changes on the orc side recently. It may be related to the end of Emperor Bimon's lifespan. After all, that old guy is about to turn 300 years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Behemoth family lived longer than our human race, there are still very few Behemoths who can live to this age in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the past practice, after succeeding to the throne, the successive emperors of Bimon would launch a southward invasion to eliminate dissidents and consolidate the imperial power through war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those guys in Northern Xinjiang jumped up and down, probably aware of something, and wanted to transfer some of their strength before the outbreak of the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood. The old man of the Orc Empire had rumors that his lifespan was about to expire before I succeeded to the throne. In the past few decades, there have been such incidents every few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really don't know what kind of sorcery the Orc Empire has. Every time I think he is about to die, but after a while, he comes out alive and kicking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing back and forth so many times, he killed three heirs. Now the crown prince is also very old, and there is a high probability that he will walk ahead of him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining youngest son is in a similar situation, both in their 150s and 60s. I heard that he was injured when he was young, and he might be gone someday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think this old son will succeed to the throne. The throne will most likely fall to one of his grandsons or great-grandsons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them make trouble, the orc empire is powerful, we can't control it anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for those guys in Northern Xinjiang, send someone to warn them. The Kingdom has raised them for so many years, so how can they just shrink back! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the long-lived Emperor Bimon, all human monarchs can only envy and envy him. Three hundred years is really too long for the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a strong man in the sanctuary of the human race, it is difficult to live beyond three hundred years. But in some long-lived groups, three hundred years old is just like playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Bimon's lifespan is longer than that of human beings, it is also limited. If it were an elf, they would still be in their prime at three hundred years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the dragon race, whether they can reach adulthood at the age of three hundred depends on the species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a self-cultivated king, he is only envious and jealous, and it is not enough for Caesar III to lose his composure and issue the most vicious curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really made him intolerable was that the royal family's foundation was taken away by this old and immortal Emperor Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was young, Caesar III still wanted to take revenge, preparing to regain his ancestral land and avenge his shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that as he grows older and suffers more beatings from society, Caesar III's mind has also matured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ideals only exist in theory after all. If they can be easily realized, they are no longer ideals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a question of whether to work hard or not, but that the strength gap between the two sides is too great. Playing heads-up, the Alpha Kingdom really can't beat the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to form gang fights, but other Terran nations are not active. There is still a lot of land available for development in the Aslant Continent. The bad land of the Orc Empire is not suitable for the survival of the human race, and it cannot mobilize everyone's enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the core reason why Caesar III, or the entire Alpha royal family, has always been unhappy with the five dukes of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the royal family's foundation was lost, if the nobles of the Northland provided reinforcements in time, there was still hope to keep it. It's a pity that under the leadership of the five major families, the reinforcements delayed their departure for two full days, which directly led to the complete collapse of the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, the power of the royal family was greatly damaged. It was a fluke to be able to keep the royal power. It was really powerless to liquidate these guys, but the feud between the two sides was settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feng Shui turns, the guy who used to cheat his teammates has now become the character who is cheated by his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current five major families in the Northland have been set up by a group of teammates, and they are not given the opportunity to transfer their foundation at all, and they have no place to retreat if they want to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Alpha Kingdom does not allow them to retreat, but the entire human race does not allow them to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is very principled in this regard. If you dare to be a deserter when aliens invade, you will face the pursuit and killing of the entire human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this principle is not only a constraint on the nobles of the North, but also a constraint on all the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the neighbors are afraid that the Alpha Kingdom will collapse again. After all, in the last continental war, two unlucky people were dragged into the water, and no one wants to be the third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So the countries joined forces in private and directly added such a clause to the \"Continental Convention\", completely putting on the table the sacred obligation of the feudal nobles to guard the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the matter is not that serious. The guys in Beijiang are only a little more active, far from this level.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, hurriedly persuaded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things can be thought of, but must not be said. It is just everyone's inference that the northern Xinjiang nobles want to transfer their foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is pure nonsense to say they are going to run away. The foundations are all in northern Xinjiang, so can you leave your ancestral foundation and give up your current identity to run away?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that the orcs didn't come over, even if they did, they could only grit their teeth and hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the establishment of the Alpha Kingdom, it has been entangled with the Orc Empire until now. Although he kept losing in heads-up, he had great summoning skills!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In the early stages of the duel, I was responsible for being beaten; in the mid-term reinforcements came, and the two sides began to fight back and forth; in the later stage, when there were more reinforcements, a full-scale counterattack was launched.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sequence has been repeated for hundreds of years, and everyone is used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that in the last continental war, the human race was besieged by more than a dozen races at the same time, facing multi-line battles, and the support from various countries was not as strong as before, King Alpha would not have lost his city or territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, there are also some big nobles deliberately holding back their legs, trying to pull the other two countries into the water and share the pressure together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the influence of many common factors, it suffered a big loss. Now that there are two more unlucky guys to share the pressure, it is more beneficial to the Alpha Kingdom strategically, so there is no need to be cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if soldiers were lost in previous wars, most of the people who died in battle were middle and lower class nobles. As a real high-ranking member of the kingdom, although he occasionally fights, the probability of survival is very high.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Now not only the Alpha Kingdom wanted his life, but even the Holy See couldn't tolerate him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So far, he doesn't know how he was exposed. He was obviously very careful, after killing people and destroying all the clues, he led them away immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to hide his identity, even the flying dragon mount was left dozens of miles away, and even the evidence of his absence was prepared. Theoretically speaking, the Alpha Kingdom shouldn't suspect them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the treatment of the wounded was carried out in a rural town two hundred miles away. Such a remote place is still a secret stronghold hidden by the Holy See, so the security should be high enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if the Alpha Kingdom noticed something, by the time they found it, their group should have left long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that just after they settled down, a coalition of nobles came to kill them the next day, and they were not even given a chance to speak up. Many soldiers were killed on the spot before they could get on the flying dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who stayed on the ground died miserably, and those who went to the sky did not escape. Although the Alpha Kingdom doesn't have flying dragon cavalry, it doesn't mean that they have nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flying monsters of several noble families and the kingdom's griffin cavalry formed a team and chased them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, the flying dragon cavalry who entered the Alpha Kingdom were directly wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Callis was able to escape by luck, but also benefited from the rolling Lancang River. Feilong died in battle, fell into the river and went downstream, allowing him to escape rounds of pursuers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drifting all the way down the river, he just woke up from the coma. Calliss, who calmed down, found himself doing a series of stupid things that he thought were clever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evidence is only needed by the weak. For really big shots, as long as they believe you did it, it doesn't really matter whether there is evidence or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Frodo went to the southeast province to deal with the blood moon horn. An accident happened on the way, and the Holy See is the first suspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, people believed that they did it. With this point of view, they looked for clues, and the evidence they found naturally pointed to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the flying dragon is dozens of miles away, even if alibi is arranged, all these can be understood as counter evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how remote and hidden it is, it is someone else's territory. Maybe the stronghold he thought was hidden was exposed to others' sight early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter has developed to this point, and it is meaningless to delve into the reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See can no longer go back, such a big thing happened, someone has to be responsible for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom couldn't wait even more. After killing the king's special envoy, a lot of nobles wanted to claim credit for his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kallis, long time no see! I never expected to see you again, and you are so embarrassed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A familiar yet unfamiliar voice came, which startled Karlis. Intuition told him that he should know this masked person, and that he was still very close, but he just couldn't remember who it was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who are you? When did we meet? What is the purpose of looking for me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three questions from the soul, after the masked man hesitated slightly, he burst out laughing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Karliss, do you really not remember me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You were in the training camp back then, but I led you in. On that stormy night thirty years ago, a wandering in the street...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the masked man finished speaking, Karlis hurriedly denied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't be him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"He is dead! In the battle to cleanse the great Lord of the Dawn of heresy—battle dead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tone of voice is biting hard, as if he believes that \"he\" has died in battle. It's just the hesitation on the surface, which has already betrayed the true thoughts in Karlis' heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thirty years ago, his family suffered great changes. At the age of eight, he was forced to live on the streets, living a day-to-day life. Until a night of wind and rain, hunger and cold, a mysterious knight appeared and changed his fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the mysterious knight, Karliss entered the knight training camp of the Holy See, and stepped into a new world from then on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the rules are strict in the Holy See. As a new quasi-knight, I can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Carliss had the ability to inquire about the mysterious knight who changed his life and destiny, he was told that the mysterious knight had died in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the specific information has been sealed up. Even if Karlis became the commander of the second regiment of the Flying Dragon Cavalry, he still has no right to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that you have remembered something, but these old things are no longer important, the key is what should you do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See will definitely not be able to go back. Those rotten moths can't do things well, but their ability to shirk their responsibilities is top-notch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although you messed up the mission this time, the person most responsible is not your turn. If we really want to get to the bottom of it, the idiot who released the Horn of the Blood Moon is the real culprit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, you can actually be considered a hero, at least you didn't let the corner of the Blood Moon fall into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with this exact result, losing a flying dragon cavalry is nothing at all. Even if the traces are exposed, it will only let the bad relationship between the two parties be brought from the audience to the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this scapegoat must be borne by you. Who let them take root in the Holy See for generations, is the real master of the Holy See, and you are just a foreign grass?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, if it weren't for the need for someone to work hard. Those guys can't wait to occupy all the positions in the Holy See so that they can enjoy the sacrifices of believers for generations! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the masked man are like needles piercing the chest, and the needles **** the atrium of Karlis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shady scenes revealed are all facts, and even the real Holy See is ten times darker than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The clergy of the Holy See, who never married for life and claimed to dedicate everything to the Lord of Dawn, actually developed the Holy See into a hard-core hereditary crop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Callis was able to become the commander of the Second Cavalry Regiment, not because of his superiors' respect. Although he is outstanding, this is not the reason for promotion. The real reason for being promoted is—dangerous work needs someone to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So he stayed in this position for ten years. During this period, he made countless contributions to the Holy See, but he still didn't move a step forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, the position of being cannon fodder is enough, and if you go further, you must be one of your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the use of saying this now, everything about the Holy See has nothing to do with me. From now on, I am already a dead person to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I still thank you for your kindness. If Your Excellency hadn't picked me up back then, perhaps Karlis would have died on a rainy night thirty years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is already earned to live an extra thirty years, and no matter when I die later, I will accept my fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still countless pursuers waiting for me, I am afraid I can only remember your kindness first. If Karlis escapes this catastrophe by chance, he will find a way to repay your kindness in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he said he was accepting his fate, the strong desire to survive was still expressed in his tone. It's just that the matter this time is too big, and it is too difficult to save one's life in the face of a kingdom's pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Karliss, don't be so pessimistic. The Alpha Kingdom wants to hunt down and kill only the Karliss of the Second Flying Dragoon Regiment of the Holy See, not all the Karliss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Change your identity, and you will find that the world will never be the same again. Just like that rainy night back then, if you hadn't asked for help, maybe we would have missed it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the masked man startled Karlis. After countless years of social tempering, he is no longer the simple boy he used to be, and he knows very well that there is no love and hate for no reason in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, he killed an earl of the Alpha Kingdom, and he was charged with such a \"crime\", which is incomprehensible anywhere, and it is impossible to obtain a pardon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, let's just say it, what do you want me to do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Carliss really doesn't think he has any capital to let an Alpha kingdom let me go. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a fact. Although golden knights are rare, it is the same for a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Alpha Kingdom as an example, there are dozens of Golden Knights on the bright side. It is impossible to recruit him as an enemy desperately just for this little combat power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Karliss, your vision has been limited by the Holy See, and you need to broaden your horizons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For big shots, as long as the interests are big enough, hatred is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, you have no deep-rooted hatred with them, and this account is mainly on the head of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's special envoy who died seemed to have a glamorous appearance, but he was not a real big shot. All his glory came from Caesar III. But he is dead now, and dead people are worthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your existence now just makes them look bad, but as long as what you do next is beneficial to them, then they can put aside the previous things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least until you lose the use value, they can ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come on, put on this mask and say goodbye to your past life. Next, we will fight for the Lord of Dawn for the rest of our lives, and no one can stop the glory of our Lord from spreading to every corner of the world! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the bewitching words of the masked man, Karliss looked dazed, and he kept interrogating himself in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting for the Lord of Dawn is the exclusive slogan of the Holy See. Although other forces would occasionally shout, it was just to enliven the atmosphere, and no one would take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the mysterious masked man in front of him is serious. This kind of soul recognition from the bottom of the heart, Karliss has only seen it in a very small number of ascetic monks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knight with such a firm belief appeared here in this way, and he also harbored a strong resentment against the Holy See. Karlis suddenly found that he could not understand the world at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doubts turned into doubts, he still took the mask after being dispelled by the desire to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any magical fluctuations, it is just an ordinary mask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitation, under the eager eyes of the masked man, Karliss put the mask on his face, but his inner doubts became more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ups and downs of the outside world did not affect Wright County. Everyone's life is still the same, those who are short of food, those who complain, and those who watch the excitement continue to eat melons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was because they had no food in their hands and felt insecure, or maybe they didn't want to support their competitors. After the agreement was reached, Baron Kettley immediately urged the deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the complicated situation in Wright County, neither Hudson nor Kettley wanted to be the first bird, so this transaction became particularly weird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Territories keep getting lost, Baron Kettley is so angry that he scolds the streets every day, and even organizes patrols to **** them, which should be guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rat plagues broke out in the mountainous territory. Countless big rats swarmed and devoured a lot of food. Baron Hudson was so angry that he rode the earth bear and roared in the forest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This weird situation lasted until the population of Maple Leaf Territory was halved, and the two places became peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is not important, anyway, this is how the two lords explained it to the outside world. There is no such thing as a transaction. Unless evidence can be found, there will be a price for nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the extra food that Maple Leaf received, it was smuggled in by a profiteer code-named Mouse, and was bought by Baron Kettley at a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The increased population of the Mountain Territory was supported by various branches of the Koslow family. This is the advantage of having a large family. If a family gathers one or two hundred people, it quickly gathers more than three thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transaction has just been completed, and when Hudson is deceiving himself and others to avoid suspicion, Baron Kettley visits the Mountain Territory again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being slaughtered last time was not enough, and he would take the initiative to send him to his door again to be slaughtered. Baron Kettley's heart was broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the season of farming is coming soon, but not only are livestock scarce in his territory, even farm tools are pitifully scarce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the opposite side plowing the field quickly, while the speed of plowing his own territory was as slow as a snail, Baron Kettley couldn't sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by the war, and the former lord's livestock basically entered the belly of the rebels. The few iron farm implements also failed to escape the poisonous hands of the rebels, and were smelted into weapons early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go to the battlefield to rummage, you may be able to find the broken pieces of these weapons. It's just that it's useless to find it. Under the corrosion of iron rust, it has already been reduced to waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having suffered from food shortage once, Baron Kettley didn't want to try again. There is no way to solve the livestock problem for a while, but the gap in farm tools can be easily filled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, who hesitated again and again in order not to be hungry in the coming year, finally plucked up the courage to visit again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A visitor is a customer, and Hudson never treats customers with negligence. This not only offered tea and snacks, it was much better than the previous treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Baron Kettley didn't focus on these details at all, so it was a waste of effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Hudson, the main reason for interrupting me this time is to buy a batch of farm tools from you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having dealt with him a few times, knowing Hudson's straightforward temperament, Baron Kettley didn't go around the corner, and directly stated his purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from having to be slaughtered last time, the situation this time is a little bit better. If he is willing to smelt weapons into farm tools, he doesn't have to come out to buy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that Baron Kettley, who was born in the Northland, does not have the concept of \"merging soldiers to make plows\" in his life creed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though there are still a lot of weapons in his warehouse that are temporarily unusable, even though he knows that he may be slaughtered if he comes here at this time, he still comes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, the farm tools are in the warehouse behind, you can go there and pick whatever you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the recent soaring prices have raised the production cost of farm tools, so the price of farm tools is a little bit more expensive than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, you can rest assured that as the largest supplier of agricultural tools in the Southeast Province, the price here is definitely the cheapest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, mountain collars only do wholesale business and do not accept scattered business. Combination products are not sold individually. All products are sold at least 200 pieces, and the minimum consumption amount for each transaction should not be less than 500 gold coins. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson introduced enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the following restrictions are completely added temporarily. Such a high threshold is not entirely for deceiving people, but mainly for the appearance fee of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his title of \"Shen Bow Knight\", even if he went out to become a mercenary, he would need at least 200 gold coins to start, and there would be bonuses for killing enemies, and he would also have to participate in the share for robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is fully twenty times that of ordinary knights, which is still the minimum standard. If Hudson is willing to take the order, even if the price is five hundred gold coins, there will still be a group of people rushing to invite him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, just because he, a sharpshooter, can break through armor and kill plate cavalry, which is enough to deter those guys in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps a large-scale cavalry charge could not be stopped, but in the face of 30 to 50 heavy cavalry, half of them could be knocked out before the opponent rushed over. It won't take long before the opponent can be wiped out on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this kind of **** life is not what the peace-loving Hudson wants. No matter how high the external bid was, Master Hudson remained unmoved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't need to go out to take orders, but the value of the appearance fee has not decreased. Now that he personally received the customer, this fee must be included in the cost of sales.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the minimum of 200 gold coins per appearance, if a single business cannot earn 200 to 300 gold coins, it is considered a loss-making business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the background of soaring prices and it is not suitable to further increase the unit price of commodities, Hudson can only play bundled sales, and seek excess returns by increasing the transaction amount of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead speechlessly, Baron Kettley reassured that this was a profiteer, not a nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, he really wants to turn around and leave, not to be exploited by profiteers here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is only one seller now. Even if scattered farm tools can be bought outside, there is a high probability that they will be wholesaled from here. He has no more choices at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then trouble Baron Hudson to lead the way ahead!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

All kinds of farm implements are neatly arranged and piled up to fill the whole room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured to choose, here is only a small part of them. If you are not satisfied, there are other styles of farm tools in the back.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be indifferent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there are not so many real types of farm tools that seem to be various. There are so many different styles, mainly from different craftsmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to provide customers with diversified services, Hudson did not engage in standardized production. After all, they are all handmade, and it is troublesome to unify the standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the need for differentiated pricing, the same product is produced by different craftsmen, and there are slight differences in price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the price gap has not widened too much. It is not that Hudson's marketing methods are not good. The main thing is that these products are ordinary farm tools and do not have the ability to pay a high premium.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An embarrassing scene appeared. Looking at the various farm tools in front of him, Baron Kettley didn't know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let him choose a weapon, it will definitely be able to speak clearly and logically, and he can conduct a professional evaluation of all weapons. However, choosing farm tools is obviously an over-the-top exam question, and it has never been within the scope of his knowledge reserve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that there were only a few kinds of farm tools, and he could just buy them directly, and Baron Kettley didn't work hard, but now he is entangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go back and bring the old farmer over to pick?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No way, wouldn't that be the great Baron Kettley, even worse than a lowly serf!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the prices marked on each piece of farm equipment, Baron Kettley breathed a sigh of relief. Although I don't know how much the price has been driven up, it is indeed not high in terms of unit price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the plow as an example, the cheapest one only costs 3.5 silver coins, and the most expensive one only costs 8 silver coins. The main factor that determines the price of a plow is not the craft shape, but its weight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, all the small farm tools are stored here. The big ones pulled by eight cows cannot be bought with a few silver coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't sell large farm tools to Baron Kettley because he didn't have enough livestock in his territory, and they were all driven by manpower, so large farm tools couldn't be used at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He casually picked up a farm tool and weighed it. Baron Kettley frowned and said: \"Baron Hudson, the toughness of these farm tools is too poor, and the sharpness is not enough. You can't use high-quality iron to carry out Build it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the most amateurish criticism, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. I'm afraid I want to go to heaven if I cast farm tools with high-quality iron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you can afford three times the price, I don't mind using high-quality iron for casting. It's just that it's too extravagant. Farm tools are just farm tools after all, and the performance requirements are far less than weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of these agricultural tools is completely sufficient for daily farming. If the quality is improved, it is not a farm tool, but a weapon. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The customer is the owner of the dawn. In theory, Hudson will not refuse any reasonable request from the customer, provided that the money must be paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to pay more, Hudson can also let his men cast agricultural tools of the same level as weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for wanting to use the price gap to buy farm tools and go back to smelting and casting weapons, that is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not Hudson's boasting. Once these agricultural tools are smelted and cast into weapons, whichever quality must be more touching, it will be as touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless money is added, the quality gap between farm tools and weapons cannot be changed. In this regard, Master Hudson is very principled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley didn't know how to choose, so he simply picked what he had seen before. Although the agricultural tools purchased may not be the most cost-effective, at least they can be guaranteed to be usable and will not be pitted too badly\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, Hudson didn't talk too much, and he was completely allowed to choose. The only restriction was that he could not bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a small problem. As a high-ranking nobleman, few like to care about it. Especially for products with low unit prices, there is no accurate pricing template in mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In less than half an hour, Baron Kettley completed the selection of products, and the efficiency is so high that it can definitely be called swift and resolute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Customers are so refreshing, Hudson is also very satisfied. This is much easier than doing business in the previous life. Not only does it have low requirements on the quality of the products, but even the after-sales service can be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a high-quality customer made Hudson feel embarrassed to cheat too hard. After all, this kind of business pays attention to the long flow of water, and the leek roots cannot be dug up at one time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are four hundred and one gold coins, three silver coins and forty copper coins in total, and the change at the back has been wiped off, so it can be counted as four hundred and one gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still a quota of ninety-nine gold coins before the minimum consumption. Why don't you choose some daily necessities, such as kitchen knives, iron pans, shovels...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything that can be used in daily life is here. Applying these products to the kitchen will greatly improve the living standards of soldiers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pushed hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't mention serfs, because he knew that in the eyes of the nobles, it was a gift for the lowly serfs to survive, and improving their living standards was not considered at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone doesn't care about the serfs, but they pay special attention to the elite soldiers under them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all meritorious ministers. If conditions permit, it is natural to give the soldiers a better life, otherwise who would be willing to sacrifice their lives?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then trouble Baron Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the two carriages he had brought were full, and there were still a pile of agricultural tools waiting to be loaded on the ground, and only costing four hundred and one gold coins, Master Kettley instantly calmed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having bought all the most needed agricultural tools, the rest is no longer a problem. Anyway, he made up his mind to only consume the minimum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that there was no more wool to be plucked, Hudson didn't bother to continue wasting his words, and directly took Baron Kettley into the kitchen warehouse to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said to be a selection, but in fact it is just a show. After hastily collecting the minimum spending amount, Baron Kettley said goodbye and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that posture, it seems that if you stay in the mountainous area for a while, you will encounter bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking about what happened to him, Hudson also expressed his understanding. He bleeds profusely every time he comes here, and the Mountain Territory is indeed an ominous place for Baron Kettley.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sending away Baron Kettler, Hudson found that there was a problem with his business model. The clients for development are all nearby neighbors, and there are none of the big clients outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, a few businessmen come to the door, and they sell more products than purchases. It's not that businessmen can't see business opportunities, it's because Hudson's products are too special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment are the best sellers, but unfortunately, they don't have any strength, so they can't do this business at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farm tools and daily necessities like pots and pans are not very risky, but the nobles and lords are used to buying iron and casting it by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with finished products, self-processing is obviously more cost-effective. Unless Hudson can significantly reduce the price, making it cheaper to purchase finished products than to cast them themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is impossible. Even if Hudson wants to play cheap dumping, he must first complete industrial production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the production capacity in the territory is concerned, there is no possibility of dumping at all. His only advantage is that he has the largest iron mine in the southeastern province, which can affect the iron price in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current rise in the price of iron commodities in the market is not only due to the local nobles driving up prices, but also a large part of the reason is that he stopped selling iron to foreign countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An embarrassing scene appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The profit from selling weapons in a short period of time mainly depends on the needs of the local nobles to expand their armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But want to promote agricultural tools and other daily necessities, the main customers are northern nobles. As outsiders, they don't have enough blacksmiths in their hands, so they can only purchase in large quantities from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides are customers, and no one can offend. Isn't this forcing yourself to be a fool?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, business is always done. Only with sufficient financial resources can Hudson be able to develop his own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although in the eyes of the local nobles in the southeastern province, the small soil pockets in the Salam Mountains are rotten land, but in Hudson's view, they still have high development value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food output can reach 70% of the outside world, and after feeding the serfs, there is still a certain balance. It's just that compared with the huge investment in land reclamation, the payback period is so much longer by so many billions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you change your mind and develop animal husbandry, there are basically no restrictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that everyone is playing with a self-sufficient economic model. There is no fixed sales market at all, and the cattle and sheep raised can only be eaten by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is consumer demand in big cities, but that is the basic market of local nobles, and it is not the turn of outsiders to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy is not suitable for the development of industry and commerce, and a self-sufficient aristocratic economy severely inhibits industry and commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson could only change the development plan of the territory repeatedly according to the actual situation. Until now, there is no complete development outline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only two main lines of development that can be determined: find ways to make money; find ways to increase the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when money and people are available can the territory be fully developed. Only when the economic foundation is improved can we have the strength to promote the development of military power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that Hudson's plan is completely incompatible with the path of the nobles in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the great nobles rose from the battlefield. Relying on the looted loot from the east and west, he realized the leapfrog development of his own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rise of every great noble family is accompanied by the birth of a \"son of luck\". There must be enough luck to complete the original accumulation all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead, Hudson, who didn't think he had bad luck, resolutely gave up following in the footsteps of his predecessors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Times have changed. The resource monopoly of the big nobles has already taken shape. Unless there is an external force to break this pattern, there will be no room for newcomers to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how hard it is to fight, the hole has already been filled, and there is no room for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either pull one off the horse and replace it; or be pushed down by others, and there will be no place to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Squeezing his thoughts, Hudson put aside the messy thoughts in his head, and directly arranged for manpower to load the car.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of the two counties gathered for a feast in Dadir City, and they must go to catch the heat. Doing a good job in this business is definitely higher than the income accumulated for three years of farming at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The carriage slowly drove out of Beida City, and the wrinkles on Earl Pierce's forehead increased again. The situation on the mainland became more and more complicated, so he had to change his plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to take the opportunity to teach the nobles who went south and north a harsh lesson, cut off their backbones, and then slowly squeezed them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the situation on the mainland has changed suddenly, and the kingdom and the Holy See are on the fence. Now the country must maintain stability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, excessively targeting the northern Xinjiang nobles who went south, this kind of thing that destroys unity is obviously not in line with the general environment of maintaining stability in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that we can only calm things down! I just don't know what those old foxes in northern Xinjiang are thinking. Do you really think that these few pawns can make waves?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, he did not take the troubled northern Xinjiang children seriously. For the real power faction in the kingdom like Earl Pierce, only the same powerful forces can be qualified to compete with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Information transmission in the magical world can be said to be fast or slow, but what really affects the speed of information transmission is the thoughts of the big shots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can make it in time, the news from the capital can reach the southeastern province on the same day. But if the big shots are not in a hurry and let the courier run around on the road, it is no problem to delay it for ten days and a half months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just message passing, not decision time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, message delivery is slow, not because the message is really slow, but because big people need slow message delivery to cover their inefficient decision-making.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is no exception. Earl Pierce has long received the news that the king's messenger was intercepted by the Holy See, which caused tension between the kingdom and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But because they didn't think about how to deal with this change, the news is already on the way, and the nobles in the southeastern province haven't even received the slightest news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When did he make a decision, and when will the news officially arrive in the Southeast Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it takes too long, the gossip may arrive first. After all, other nobles are not vegetarians either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no channel for the rapid transmission of information, the noble children who are away from home will also take the initiative to inquire about the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary news is nothing more than that. For news that has a greater impact, everyone will still find a way to pass it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just because the news comes from \"inquiry\", how high the accuracy rate is, it can only depend on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have the ability to deliver news are mostly nobles with some family background. Even if the little nobles at the bottom know the news, it is difficult to send it back in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Da da da…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of the carriage going forward continued to ring non-stop, and Dadir City, a hundred miles away, had become very lively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are also strictly hierarchical. Although a time has been agreed, everyone still consciously arrives ahead of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even a group of northern Xinjiang nobles who didn't deal with the Governor's Mansion very much didn't put on airs at this time, and honestly came to wait first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bustling is not the same as prosperity. Despite Baron Sith's hard work, Dadir City is still a city of ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fix it, it will be difficult to see results without a year or two of effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host, Baron Sith's recent days are one—“bitter”.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influx of a large group of nobles is equivalent to a lot of trouble coming to your door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was a shortage of food in the territory, and he had to receive such a group of uncles, which made his poor pocket even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sith were a little suspicious. Governor Pierce placed the mediation location in Dadir City, which was deliberately aimed at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Lizi, face is no longer enough. In order to save money, Baron Sith even canceled the welcome banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Daily reception is also limited to provision of temporary shelter, water, firewood and some simple daily necessities, no specific food at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a matter of being stingy or not, but that the lord's family really has no food left. At the very least, he really doesn't have that much food that matches his aristocratic status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to lose face, anyway, apart from being uncomfortable at the beginning, this thing will pass slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What makes Sith a headache is that there are not many nobles who are safe, and they are either doing something, or they are on the way to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting and fighting, that is just the most basic operation. If you are not careful, it will be a street fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the clear camps before, he only needs to consider the interests of the nobles in northern Xinjiang. Now as the host, he was born with the duty of maintaining order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Casualties of ordinary soldiers don't matter, if a certain noble bumps into each other, or simply dies, he will be held responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain order, he not only sent his men out, but even patrolled the streets himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this is of no use. The northern nobles gave him some face as the nominal boss, but the local nobles simply ignored him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking things, always only need one side is enough. As long as someone makes trouble, the other party can only participate passively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, he made a real fire, even those who persuaded the fight were beaten together. In order to persuade the fight, Baron Sith's subordinates often go out in high spirits and come back with a bruised nose and a swollen face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were even a few unlucky guys who were killed by mistake during the process of persuading the fight, and died directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, there was nothing to say, just endless wrangling. Those who dare to have such a good time are nobles, and ordinary soldiers have the concept of killing for life in their minds, and they know that they can't kill them on such occasions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, Baron Sith can only accept this kind of bad luck. The perpetrator is only responsible for losing money, and if he wants the other party to pay for his life, he can only appeal to the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to think about it, you know, it's time to stop here. The essence of the aristocratic council is to safeguard the interests of the aristocrats, and it is self-evident who the outcome will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was really angry, so I could only find a chance to beat the other party afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Baron Sith has only one thought, hoping that Earl Pierce can arrive soon, otherwise he really can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the chaotic scene, not only Sith, the host, was hurt, but Hudson, the \"businessman\", was also very angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was just a happy melon-eating crowd, quietly watching the performances of all parties. With the enlarged three-meter body of the Earth Bear, it was enough to calm down the hot-headed guys instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, when the nobles fight and fight, everyone knows how to restrain themselves and know the severity of the attack. Warcraft is hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current physique of the Earth Bear, he is not a professional researcher of Warcraft, so he can't tell which stage he has grown to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he was slapped to death, he would be wronged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People fake Xiong Wei, Hudson walked to the street, it was smooth sailing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, accidents always come so suddenly, before the excitement is over, I become the focus first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Set up a stall on the street, unfortunately involved in the conflict between two gangs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just the stall being smashed, that's nothing. The key is that the guy who hit the real fire picked up a sledgehammer and opened the opponent's head.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Especially the warring parties were overwhelmed by this scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young aristocrat who took the shot was ashamed, holding the hammer in panic, not knowing what to do. Fighting is a trivial matter, and killing a nobleman is a disaster that will break the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone's eyes were focused on the noble in the pool of blood, Hudson once had the idea of ​​​​abandoning the stall and taking advantage of the chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he didn't start the fight, nor did he overthrow the people. It's just a hammer, as long as he escapes from the scene, he will be fine if he bites him to death and refuses to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, why don't you hurry up and hire a pastor!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him not to run, if he slipped away at this time, there would be **** behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobility is not only about evidence, but also about reputation. With a good reputation, it can be eaten no matter where it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many people present have seen it, and escaped responsibility, but they can't stop everyone's long talk!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People don't know whether they are dead, so they run away in a hurry. Isn't it telling others that this matter has something to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of this, it is better to stay and deal with it actively. As the owner of the hammer, it would indeed be troublesome to be involved, but that was just trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please pastor, indeed remind everyone. But this is a correct nonsense, pastors and gentlemen will not come here to eat dirt just after the war has subsided and the reconstruction work has just begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the priest must move in only after the territory has a certain economic foundation and the church has been repaired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What level of priest is, it depends on the means of the lords. Generally speaking, the wealthier the territory, the more popular it is with priests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the war, with Dadir City as the center, there was no trace of the priest for dozens of miles. When the priest was invited over, the corpse was probably completely cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rescue, just think about it. A group of bosses bandaged the wounds roughly and simply. This kind of head injury is really embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the person is rescued, then everyone will be happy and gain a lot of favors; but if the person disappears during the rescue process, it will be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get favors, people might suspect that this is a deliberate murder. Human nature is the most vulnerable thing to test.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a strong talker, Hudson decisively chose to save people with his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The guy with the sledgehammer, hurry up and put down his weapon to rescue the wounded. If this kid on the ground dies, you almost have to confess.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever caused the disaster is responsible for the thunder. Based on the principle of not deceiving others, Hudson decisively left the task of treating the wounded to the perpetrator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"But I can't save people!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the young nobles surrounded by the crowd were about to cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, his subordinates were relatively strong. At the critical moment, a middle-aged soldier in shabby clothes came out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he wasn't too stupid. After reacting from his panic, the young nobleman immediately contributed his clothes to serve as gauze to bind the wound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intentional killing and accidental killing are not the same concept. The former has a high probability of paying for his life, and the latter can offer a set meal for the northern border defense after compensating the other party for a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the days of distribution to the frontier were bitter and dangerous, it was more comfortable to go to the northern border than to meet the Lord of the Dawn directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is no large-scale invasion of orcs, the annual death rate of the border nobles usually does not exceed 5%. Among the guys who died in battle, more than half died in the process of slave hunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Sith Baron is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who shouted, and the crowd gave way tacitly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relevant person in charge +1, Hudson feels more at ease. With one more unlucky guy to accompany him, he wasn't too lonely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can any of you tell me what happened here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith asked helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has dealt with many similar situations, but this time the situation is more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, you look at me, I look at you, and I don't know when their eyes focused on Hudson. The expectant look in his eyes was obviously urging him to hurry up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, and it is the dispute between the northern nobles and the local nobles. The Sith Baron can represent the northern nobles, and naturally there must be someone with a matching status among the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, among the local nobles at the scene, Hudson is a little more famous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he belongs to the neutral camp, it does not prevent everyone from pushing him forward. After all, this kind of thing is often accompanied by a series of wrangling, if the representative is too weak, it will suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't the situation obvious? A group of people are here to engage in a fight, and they lose control of their emotions after fighting. Accidentally caused the current situation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said evasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Status determines the position, even if he thinks the impulsive young nobleman in the middle should take the responsibility, but for the sake of belonging to the same local nobles, he still has to defend one or two points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Things that are about to kill people, your Excellency just so lightly defines it as a fight, I'm afraid I can't explain it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now his status is really embarrassing. On the one hand, he has to protect the interests of the noble camp in northern Xinjiang, and on the other hand, he has to maintain stability in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need to go into these details. With our current identities, you and I are not qualified to deal with this matter. Anyway, it doesn't matter if you talk about it. Why waste your words here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Protect the scene well. Your Excellency the Governor will arrive in Dadir City in a few days. When the time comes, report directly, and he will give a fair ruling. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Professional dumping, choking Sith to death. Reported to the governor's ruling, Hudson's affairs are over, but his troubles have just begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention that as the host, he has no responsibility to maintain order, but his status as the leader of the nobles in northern Xinjiang requires him to continue to follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the next time he is arguing with him will not be a small fish like Hudson, but a senior official of the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of arguing with the officials in the Governor's Mansion, it is better to draw a conclusion on the matter now, at least to be able to control the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I didn't expect to be able to be a famous bow knight here, and let us meet on this occasion. But you defend this person so much, could it be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hidson was not surprised when his identity was found out. There is the iconic Earth Bear, and there are really few people who don't recognize his identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of half-talking, which is the easiest way to make people think wildly, but it really disgusts him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter if it's not or not. Baron Sith has the time to care about these details, so it's better to get someone to rescue the wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on your moral cultivation, even if this unlucky guy offended you before, he wouldn't be willing to die now, would he? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he dared to point the finger at him, no wonder he fought back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What surprised Hudson was that he didn't seem to have offended this person, but as soon as this guy saw his identity, he became very hostile towards him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is there a conflict of interest between the two?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's possible, but it's all potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The person in front of him doesn't look like a fool, does he?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there may be a potential conflict of interests, and it is necessary to be an enemy, then everyone in the world is an enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the same as choosing not to eat or drink if you may choke to death when you eat or drink water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the reason, and it doesn't prevent the two from conflicting. Everyone else handed out their knives, and Hudson would not hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Baron Sith is the most powerful noble in the two counties, if they really match up, it doesn't matter who will suffer!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think that all the northern Xinjiang nobles will really listen to his command. Even the retainers and children of the Felix family may not really take him as an illegitimate child seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two fell into a stalemate, and the crowd of onlookers also divided into two waves. Looking at the expression eager to try, it seemed that they hoped that the two of them could do it here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is impossible. Fighting in other people's territory is definitely asking for trouble. Hudson is such a cautious master, he will definitely not choose violence to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith also didn't dare to do anything. As the host, it's fine if he can't maintain order. If he leads people off the stage to fight with the guests, his reputation will really be bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, he regrets it now. Although it is suspected that Hudson has a connection with his competitor, but the account can be kept and settled slowly in the future, there is no need to turn his face at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the two stabbed each other with a knife, neither of them was able to get a bargain, and they were framed by each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing to fight like this, the two unlucky **** who had little to do with this fight, might be involved in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry about Baron Hudson. In order to avoid accidents, I have sent someone to invite the pastor.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this statement is true, it is only half the truth. He did invite the pastor early, but unfortunately, the benefactors behind these people are all local nobles, so they didn't buy his account at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally met someone who accepted the invitation, but that guy's ancestors had a feud with the Felix family, so he was directly put together. He promised well, but there was no one there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's best to be so natural. Now that Baron Sith is ready, we can rest assured that the wounded will be handed over to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, let's go, just leave this place to Baron Sith, we don't need to stay here to make trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, regardless of whether Baron Sith was willing to take over the mess, Hudson turned around and left without giving him a chance to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles who reacted chose to keep up without hesitation. Those who lay down were the nobles of the Northland, and the hot potato was also thrown out, and they continued to stay as witnesses for the other party. Everyone is not that great yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, people are still alive, so it is just a violent injury incident. If he dies in an accident and there is no local noble to witness, it will be a bad debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, the spearhead, was arranged, and the wounded had a feud with Baron Sith. Regardless of whether it is true or not, the local nobles selectively believe that it is true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the wounded dies unfortunately, then there are two suspects, and the debt is definitely bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the fact that Baron Sith had a feud with the wounded was purely Hudson's nonsense and could not stand up to in-depth research. This bad debt is even more unfavorable to the middle-ranking nobleman who made the move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But no matter how bad the debt is, it is better than full responsibility. They all hang out in the same circle, and they are more or less passionate, so they have to take care of their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you know the responsibilities of your own camp, at this critical moment, everyone can only help relatives and not help. This is the essence of staying together to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The carriage moved forward slowly, and just about to calm things down, I pressed down on the conflict between my younger brother and the noble children of Northern Xinjiang, but I didn't expect bad news to come again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bustling Dadir City has finally reached the point where people are killed. Intuition told him that he couldn't delay on the road slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the conflict intensifies, a group of local noble children and northern Xinjiang noble children will collide in Dadir City. No matter who wins, it will be a tragedy that shocks the whole country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scapegoat of this level cannot be carried by the small body below, and it will only be pinned on him, the governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Earl Pierce stepped onto his horse and set off in a hurry with a team of cavalry. As for the carriage and guard of honor, they can only follow slowly behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce led the cavalry to finish the remaining 100 miles in less than three hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the horses that got off the horse were all exhausted after running for hundreds of miles. If these war horses hadn't been stained with the blood of monsters, they would have been useless for playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The angry boss arrived ahead of time, and the nobles who were too late to greet him were terrified besides panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the people involved, Hudson also complained secretly. Although the blame was given to Baron Sith, anyone with a discerning eye knew what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce doesn't like the nobles of northern Xinjiang, but it doesn't mean he likes him. Although the old matter of refusing to solicit has not been mentioned, it does not mean that the matter is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't found him bad luck, mainly because of \"political correctness\". The halo of killing the Holy See cavalry has not completely dissipated, and Earl Pierce, who cherishes his feathers, will naturally not do anything to give others a handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a reasonable excuse, he can be taught a lesson. Hudson believes that this round of boards will definitely not be light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why don't you talk anymore, these days, you guys have done really well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, they plundered and killed each other. If the large and small battles are added together, I am afraid that the civilian casualties will not be lower than four digits, right? The compassionate spirit of the nobles has been thrown out of the sky by you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These days have been even worse, from civilian casualties to nobles. Don't worry, only one nobleman died and twenty-three were injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can continue to fight, it is best to kill everyone who dislikes you, in the end you will be invincible, and the whole continent is yours!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being scolded, Hudson secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Experience told him that when something goes wrong, he is not afraid of being scolded by the leader, but he is afraid of being treated nicely by the leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being scolded means that there is still room for salvation. If the leader is kind and pleasant, he is ready to let you take the blame. It's a trivial matter to resign and leave, and you might be able to account for it for the rest of your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stupid Baron Sith, as the lord of Dadir City, so many field conflicts happened in your house, don't you have anything to say?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are old and physically weak and unable to fulfill your lord's obligations, I can suggest that the kingdom be replaced by a lord in the prime of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Our Baron Hudson performed exceptionally well. Not only was it possible to arrive at the scene of the battle in time, organize manpower to treat the wounded, even the murder weapons used by others were also prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson endured the sowing and dissension in front of him. Anyway, he matched up with Baron Sith, and he didn't care about adding a sum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the last sentence is really too much. It was true to organize manpower to \"rescue the wounded\", but because the pastor failed to arrive in time, the people were still gone in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine to be ridiculed, but it is really wrong to prepare the \"weapon\". Although he sold a lot of weapons during the conflict in the city, it was just a normal sale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What people do with their own weapons is the freedom of others, and he has no right to interfere at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson admitted that he had made money from the war, especially after the sledgehammer incident, the sledgehammer produced by his family was particularly popular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the spot stock was sold out, but even the production order was pushed to a month later. But these are all business, there is absolutely no \"weapon\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to justify. Even the tough-headed Baron Sith obediently listened to the training, and Hudson didn't dare to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you scold, you can scold, anyway, you won't lose a piece of meat. Accounts are kept first, and when the Dalton family is unlucky one day, everyone is slowly calculating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is never too late for Hudson to take revenge. Anyway, he is younger than Earl Pierce. As long as he pays attention to maintenance, he will definitely have a chance to bungee jump from Pierce's grave in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the number of nobles who were pulled out of the list is a bit large, whether they are the children of northern Xinjiang nobles or local nobles, they have all been taken care of. Almost all nobles with a little bit of strength enjoyed the treatment of individual criticism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that strength is directly proportional to the ability to cause trouble. If he dared to make a fuss without any strength, he would have been taught to be a man long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the reprimand was over, Hudson was surprised to find that Earl Pierce did not mention the parties involved in the incident. Obviously, this doesn't mean things are over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is intentional killing or beating someone to death by mistake, it is a life lawsuit involving nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not brought up for discussion on the spot, then it is ready to be dealt with coldly. It's just that the final result will definitely not be simple, otherwise the northern Xinjiang nobles who have lost their teammates will not let it go.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although the specific details were not directly drilled, the facts of the transaction were exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson has always been relatively quiet. He only made a few transactions in a low-key manner, and there is not much black history to dig.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the scene where the thunder was rolling, there were enough hot spots to attract people's attention, and this trivial matter was quickly ignored by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts once again prove that the level of morality depends entirely on the foil of colleagues. Compared with the thunderous nobles, doing business with neighbors is nothing at all, even if the commodities traded are a little bit special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles are blocking the nobles in the northern Xinjiang in series, but Hudson didn't join them either! Without joining, naturally there would be no betrayal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the neutral camp, it is still acceptable to buy and sell goods to both camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of thunderstorms are different, that is the lower limit of various shows. Cruelty, greed, and excessive extortion can all be considered nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hitting teammates is just a routine operation; sowing dissension and asking allies to help take the mine is just a normal level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Colluding with the enemy secretly to betray teammates, or even buying the enemy to attack the allies, completely unscrupulous practices, have really happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scandals that were not on the table were all exposed, and ruined reputation became inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that Earl Pierce's elite attack has hit the weakness of many people. Whether they can slow down or not depends on their own methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But other problems can be solved, but the loss of reputation, that is really gone forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Betrayal has never been zero or countless times. Morality can be avoided, but if it violates the rules of the game, it will inevitably be backlashed by the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord who has been cultivating the southeastern province for hundreds of years, it is not surprising that Earl Pierce can grasp this information. The only thing that puzzled Hudson was that these cards, which could have been used as bargaining chips to coerce a group of nobles for their own use, should be played all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't think that Earl Pierce is really jealous and can't allow these bad things to happen in his jurisdiction. If you really want to stop it, you can stop it from the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It looks like it should be able to calm down for a while. Hudson, your boy has been living a really good life recently!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this familiar voice, Hudson suddenly became enlightened. \"Stay for a while,\" Earl Pierce wanted the land of the two counties to be stable for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the motivation, then everything makes sense. The aristocrats with some strength in the two counties were basically beaten over and over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each of them, more or less, has a disgraceful black history exposed. Just dealing with their own bad things is enough for everyone to be busy for a while, and naturally they don't have the energy to do other things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of operation, which always gives Hudson a sense of familiarity, as if he has seen it somewhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson suddenly recalled. Where it is just familiarity, it is clearly copying homework.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar routines are all left over from the game of His Majesty Caesar III in the capital. When he first succeeded to the throne, all the nobles were making a fuss, and repeated attempts to appease him didn't work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The angry Caesar III simply overturned the table and put the black history of the struggle of the nobles directly on the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result is self-evident. A lot of nobles were beaten up, and they were all busy wiping their own asses, so naturally they didn't care about embarrassing the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a temporary solution, not the root cause, it is enough if the method works. The best way to stabilize the situation in a short period of time is to let all parties be overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, if I still have something to do, I will go first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking, without waiting for Baron Cheers to stay, Hudson turned around and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally everyone had a good relationship, but at a banquet, this lady revealed her intention to marry her daughter to Hudson, and the relationship between the two parties suddenly changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic marriage, Hudson has long been prepared. But even if you want to trade marriage, at least you have to marry someone who is eye-catching!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Chelsea's daughter, who is big and thick, doesn't fit Hudson's aesthetics at all, so she can only hide for now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of trouble became endless after Hudson's territory was on the right track. There are no fewer than ten nobles who have revealed their intention to marry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all are of the same grade, and all of them follow the principle of matching each other. There is no climbing dragon and phoenix, and no princess is too hot-headed to favor him as a little baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman is very satisfied with most of them. If it weren't for the large number of interested families, he couldn't make up his mind for a long time, and he might have already made a decision for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the news, Hudson immediately wrote a letter to his father, expressing his strong rejection in earnest words, and only temporarily dispelled his dangerous idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marriage of nobles must be done carefully. Once settled, even if you know there is a pitfall, you can only bite the bullet and jump into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two families are involved, and the two surnames are good friends. For the long-term stability of the relationship, under normal circumstances, everyone follows the principle of voluntariness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That kind of forced marriage cannot be said to be completely absent, but it still rarely happens in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for free love, that is really too extravagant. Except for a small number of childhood sweethearts who grew up together, they can barely be considered free love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal aristocratic marriages first consider status, followed by personal ability and moral cultivation, and finally personal wishes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Men and women have a very narrow range of mate selection, and they can almost only choose each other within their own family's social circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, if you encounter something you don't like, then give it up quickly! Dragging it to the back will only find that the next one is even more difficult to accept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The story of the prince and Cinderella, the story of the princess and the knight, there is a prerequisite, there is a good father who is a powerful earl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is already the minimum requirement. Only when this minimum requirement is met, will there be love, otherwise it will be just a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reality was a bit cruel, Hudson still expressed his understanding. In this cruel world, if you want to survive better, you must learn to hold together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is true for the small nobles, and so is the great nobles. Marriage is undoubtedly the most economical way to consolidate the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the principle of not losing money, the rules of the game that belong to each other are slowly derived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why run so fast, even if you have to pay a fine, don't be in such a hurry!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the complaints coming from behind, Hudson became more and more depressed. He is a sledgehammer seller, and has nothing to do with the Kailao incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in the final judgment, he was still charged with selling \"murder weapons\". Conscience of heaven and earth, he didn't have time to collect the sledgehammer that opened the ladle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blatant retaliation made Hudson put down his defense. Reason told him that without enough strength, trying to overthrow the decisions of the big shots would only make the situation worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge fine of three hundred gold coins, he didn't know how many sledgehammers he would have to sell to earn it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He thought he could make a fortune, but in the end Hudson found out helplessly that all the profits from selling the sledgehammer had been paid a fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Hudson quickly accepted the reality. Without any public relations activities, he directly chose to save money and avoid disasters, which is considered to be buying an advertising space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, after the opening incident, all the nobles in the two counties knew that the \"Knight of the Bow\" was not only super skilled in archery, but also an arms dealer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chi Yu was also affected by the unlucky Baron Sith. Compared to Hudson's fine of 300 gold coins, his penalty reached an astonishing 500 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Baron Sith doesn't have a sledgehammer to sell, and he doesn't need to carry out advertising and promotion. All losses can only be borne by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two pond fish are so miserable, the parties involved in the case will not be able to escape. It is not possible to pay for life, but the result of the treatment is similar to that of paying for life. All the participants were sent to the northern border for garrison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"All\", this is the point. Not only the second-ranking knight \"Joseph\" who opened the scoop, but all the other people involved in the brawl were also implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The severity of this punishment is quite astonishing. The accomplice and the principal offender enjoy the same treatment. Earl Pierce told everyone with practical actions: I am the boss and I am the master!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important to know that the person who died this time was a son of a nobleman from northern Xinjiang. He ran to guard the enemy's house and wanted to escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being ruthless is a bit ruthless, but this is indeed a result acceptable to all parties except the parties involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the two unlucky Chiyu who were affected by the disaster, who are still aggrieved, the nobles in the two counties have been warned and educated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The incident of opening the scoop came to an end, but it was just the beginning. The recent fights in the city, counted one by one, were all dealt with seriously by Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fine\", \"fine\", \"further fine\"... All the nobles involved have received punishment notices of varying amounts. If it weren't for the fines to be collected in the noble council, Hudson would have suspected that the earl was taking the opportunity to make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just three days, the total amount of fines issued by the Governor's Mansion directly exceeded 30,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a side courtyard of the City Lord's Mansion, the Sith Baron, who had accumulated a lot of anger, finally reached the brink of eruption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pierce, what exactly does this **** want to do? Do you really think that our Felix family is easy to bully and can be slaughtered by him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Again and again, and again and again...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish speaking, the old man behind him hastily dissuaded him: \"Master, don't say these words indiscriminately, it will cause big trouble if people hear them!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really can't talk nonsense, Baron Sith ran to the side courtyard to live in a small house, because the main courtyard of the City Lord's Mansion has been given over to the governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance is not far. If the sound is too loud, it reaches the ears of the narrow-minded governor. He still doesn't know what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kesis is really suffering. As the worst fish of the year in the southeastern province, he has suffered too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every conflict that occurred in Dadir City, he was charged by the Governor's Mansion with \"not maintaining order\", \"allowing chaos to occur\", \"failing to perform the duties of the lord\"..., and then fined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the fines of more than 30,000 gold coins determined so far, Baron Sith alone contributed one-fifth. Although no one said anything in front of him, the hat of \"Great Injustice\" has been given to him by the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the younger brothers of the northern Xinjiang nobles, they are very dissatisfied with the \"steadiness\" shown by the boss in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little brothers want him to make trouble, and the local nobles also want to see him make trouble. There is no doubt that since everyone wants him to make a fuss, \"be more steady\" is the best choice for Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be targeted, but the charges given by the Governor's Office are not without purpose. If there was a head-on conflict with Governor Pierce, it would be Baron Sith himself who would suffer in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking for an identity backer, it is a pity that these punishments are aimed at his grand duke father. Rhossis is not the son of Grand Duke Kavadia, nor can he enjoy this treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"He dares to do whatever he is afraid of, so how can he keep people from talking about it? Anyway, no matter what I do, the final result will be the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them are punished at the top level, and those who can make use of the problem have been used to the extreme by our Lord Governor. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If not all of Earl Pierce's targeted behaviors were within the scope of the rules, he would have made a fuss long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a second generation, how can he have no temper. Being able to endure until now is considered a good heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But complaints are complaints, Baron Sith did not go to the next door to make a scene after all. The cruel reality made him more aware of the importance of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current unfair treatment is because the right to dispose is in the hands of the other party. Any small problem can be magnified and dealt with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, our troubles may have just begun. Now it is only the governor who handles the conflicts in the city, and then the nobles attack and plunder each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to small things like fighting and fighting, the latter is the big trouble. Although there are good reasons for every action we take, there are always imperfections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If any loophole is discovered, the punishment will be more serious than it is now. If the governor wants to continue to target us, I'm afraid something big will happen. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the old man is cowardly, but his rich life experience tells him that once the superior person realizes the truth, it will be a violent storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too late, Uncle Faerun.

Everything is as he expected, and it will not be easy to be able to secure the position of one of the princes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's performance in suppressing the Skull and Bones rebellion was far from enough. Since there are shortcomings in the military, it must be made up for in other aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, it seems that it is just an excuse, but the deep meaning in essence is not as simple as it is on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just imposing a fine can only be regarded as indifferent to the nobles. But that's only for the veteran lords, who have stable financial resources and can afford financial punishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the newly promoted lords, that is completely two concepts. Almost all the territories in Wright and Wyton counties are unable to make ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 90% of the territories now only have expenditures and no income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a state of sitting and eating, and everyone wants to break a gold coin into two halves, and then encounter a huge fine, that is, the leak in the house happens to rain overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although all the lords are noble N generations, this does not mean that the family resources will be infinitely tilted towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a family wants to pass it on for a long time, the most important thing is the rules. Outstanding children can certainly take away more resources, but children from other families are not dead, and can also share a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the premise of ensuring that the strength of the family is not affected first, the support that everyone can get is not unlimited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has a deep understanding of this point. His father's territory is not bad. There are tens of thousands of gold coins in every year, and there is no large-scale development of armaments. Logically speaking, it should be very nourishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the fact is just the opposite. Because of too many brothers and sisters and scattered resources, life is very ordinary instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the expenses are all on the bright side, and you can figure it out by stretching out your fingers. The total income is indeed a lot. If there is no dream, the family's life of luxury and money can be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once there is a pursuit, the expenses will rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily expenses of the territory account for 60% of the income, including production input, infrastructure investment, the operation of the baron's mansion, taxes, guards...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the remaining 40% of the income, nearly 10% is spent on social expenses and entertainment. The other 30% of income is real disposable income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the money has to be set aside as a reserve to deal with sudden changes such as wars and famines. The support needed by children like Hudson to start a business is all spent from this reserved fund.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Savings, that is, when their brothers were young. As you get older, there are more places to spend your money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eldest son inherits the family business, but it does not mean that the second son does not need help. At the very least, you have to provide some financial support when you first leave the house, and you have to bear a certain amount of expenses when it's time to get married.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only relying on self-struggle, it is estimated that there are leftover men and women everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a daughter gets married, she also needs to give a dowry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the time the first child gets married to the youngest child settles major personal affairs, basically don't even think about having any savings during this period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why the nobles in northern Xinjiang have strong military strength is because they have cut off most of their interpersonal expenses, and their weddings and funerals are also kept simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the reserves are only available to families with some strength. A small family can achieve a balance of income and expenditure, which is considered a good year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make up for the shortfall, in addition to actively participating in smuggling activities, they have to participate in slave hunting operations from time to time, going deep into the orc empire to plunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the children of northern Xinjiang nobles who went south, it seems that all of them are worth a lot of money. In fact, a large part of it is earned by them on the family platform and by exerting their personal talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either develop a smuggling business, or directly lead a team out to plunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to make money is also an important criterion for the nobles of the Northland to evaluate the potential of the younger generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the children of northern Xinjiang nobles who were able to go south are the best among them. At least he led the team to carry out more than five slave hunting operations, and escaped unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure does not exist, because the losers are already dead. People will only remember the winners, no one cares about the life and death of the losers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the official statistics on the death rate of the nobles only count those whose bodies can be found. Those who went deep into the orc empire and never returned are all judged as missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is a Woohoo or a slave in the Orc Empire, no one knows, anyway, the end result is very miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also being fined, the condition of the local nobles is much better. On the one hand, the way of getting the money is different, on the other hand, because of the loss, the fines are mostly symbolic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Lord Hudson, who was fined the worst, paid the fine without blinking an eye. Others have single-digit or double-digit fines, and there is no need to be sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang nobles feel differently. In addition to family sponsorship, there is also a lot of hard-earned money earned by their own lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all money, and it must be hard-earned money when it goes out, at least deep down they think so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flesh pain is second. The key is that after the financial resources are weakened, the development of the territory is also greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce fines, and in exchange for local nobles lifting the blockade, many nobles were forced to return most of the robbed population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm almost out of cooking, I really can't afford to support so many people, and I can't do it without compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a lot of tossing, all the wallets that had the strength to make a fuss were dry. These people don't have the capital to make a fuss without recuperating for a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, haven't you made less money recently?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Adrian said enviously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are also strugglers. The efforts of their father and son for two generations were lucky enough to get a piece of land, and Hudson reached the height he looked up to when he appeared on the stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to obtain resources for development, he even gave up the most valued face of the nobles. As a result, looking at his distant cousin, the gap between the two sides widened even further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A little business, just earning some hard money. Even this is not peaceful, and I worry about being missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian, you have gained a lot this time, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more than 7,000 people have passed Minglu this time, and they all belong to you. The funniest thing is that group of idiots who want to apologize and pay compensation to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although you don't have much money, your name as Knight Adrian resounds throughout the two counties. Now who doesn't know that you are the most difficult knight in the two counties! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed hard money, and it is hard work to collect money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goods delivered, whether it was weapons and equipment, pots and pans, or various agricultural tools, were all sold out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deposit alone is soft, and all the orders added up are enough to keep the territory busy for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to calculate the profit, but the payment received is as high as 8,000 gold coins, and there is also a deposit of 13,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all subsequent products are sold, 35,000 gold coins will be credited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that after this business is completed, all the investment in the early development of the territory will be paid back. If the cost control is good, you should still be able to make some money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the pockets of the customers are not rich. If Earl Pierce hadn't slaughtered them first and weakened the purchasing power of the customers, the total number of orders might have increased by 8,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of earning too much that there is this small family gathering. In order to prevent some guys from taking risks, Hudson also had to rely on family power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that they did not expect to receive such a large deposit in advance. Hudson did not bring many troops, and more than 20,000 gold coins were enough to make some habitual criminals take risks. Especially Hudson offended someone this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was being transported was gold coins, and I was worried about asking outsiders to **** them, so I simply invited my own family members to **** them for a ride.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Many people are useless. It's not like you don't know about my family background. It's only a little better than Berio and Guarente, and it's incomparable with you, an upstart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was okay to be fostered by the tribe, but then I sent it back to my territory. I don't even know how to solve the problem of eating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't always borrow food, can you? From the time I got the territory to now, I owe a lot of favors. If I try to cause famine now, I really can't bear it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the conversation between the two in Versailles, Baron Berio and the Knight of Guarente, who were eating melons, felt that they had been connoted, and glared directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One is worried about money, and the other is worried about people. They don't dislike these troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of thing can only be envious and jealous. I really want to ask for help, even if everyone is my own family, I have to settle the account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like Hudson hired them as guards this time, they all promised to pay each of them fifty to one hundred spears, and the price directly depends on their respective strengths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough is enough for the two of you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of good thing is too troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two of us don't dislike it and are willing to help you share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are you willing to share these troubles? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Berio couldn't help but said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Guarente knight on the side also nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too bullying, and it doesn't consider the feelings of the two poor ghosts at all. You must know that since inheriting the territory, the two have been relying on favors and famines to support them until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally heard that Hudson was going to hire them as guards, and thought they could earn some pocket money to subsidize their family, but they didn't expect that when they came here, they would be greeted by a large Versailles scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I can credit you two hundred swords, one thousand spears, eighty hammers, fifty giant axes, three hundred cauldrons...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allow you to use physical offsets, and all accounts are paid at market prices. It will be settled within three years, and you will not be charged a copper coin interest. Is it enough to give you face? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson unceremoniously sent the Dafa of changing the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money cannot be divided, but weapons and equipment can still be supported. They are all members of the Koslow family. No matter which branch's military strength is strengthened, it means that the family's voice in the local area will increase, which is good for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for daily necessities such as farm tools, it can only be regarded as incidental. The utilitarianism that can be concealed by being mixed together shows his heroism of Baron Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the current market price is not low. Even if the payment is made in installments of three years, the business is still profitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you can't treat them differently, I also want to pay on credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that I have offended many people this time, if I don't strengthen my strength, I will suffer a lot later! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the two could answer, Adrian, who couldn't sit still, jumped out first. The reason why it was sold so badly earlier was to get a discount when buying weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you can pay on credit, and you can pay in kind, that would be great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, the bad neighbors have been offended terribly. A temporary cessation does not mean a permanent peace. Sooner or later, everyone will still face each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for Adrian to lie flat all the time. The territory still needs to be built after all. If he does not expect to suffer a big loss, he must first improve his military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not extravagant to expect to be able to hang and beat up a group of neighbors, at least it must be able to deter them and make them fearful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Credit, no problem! But Adrian, you have so many people, can a knight afford it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the territory has a population of more than 10,000, not only has his desire for population not diminished, but it has become more intense with the increase in his pockets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Salam Mountain Range is a hilly area, since it has been crowned with a mountain range, the area is naturally not small. Nominally, the mountainous area is only more than 170 square kilometers, but in fact, the land available for development can be increased by ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this development is not limited to farming. Just farming, it would be nice to have one-third of the land that can be developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of the utilization rate of agricultural land, the hilly areas are far behind the plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, with the current productivity, it is only suitable for extensive planting and low harvest, and intensive cultivation can starve people to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, I don't need to worry about this. Although my territory only has one knight realm, don't forget that those who are responsible for dividing the territory are all my colleagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't move the boundary line seven or eight miles around, is it worthy of the friendship I have worked with them for many years? If it is managed well, it will be no worse than ordinary barons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The border moved seven or eight miles to the outside world, and the area of ​​the Knights' Territory was directly doubled several times, and it was even possible to catch up with the Barony's Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When other people encounter such a good thing, they hide it one by one, lest they spread it and cause trouble. Including Hudson, who took advantage of the territorial division process, they were all worried for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian was able to speak out freely, without any fear of hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the biggest benefit of being surrounded by the boss, even if the area of ​​the territory far exceeds the specification, it can still be covered. It's useless to report, and Earl Pierce will suppress the governor's mansion if he makes a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't bring the lawsuit to the king because of the territorial issue of a knight's domain, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the feudal era, the bosses were not afraid of such things being exposed. If it really gets out, it will be a publicity for them, and it will increase the attraction to talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, if you are really short of people, go to the branches of the family to ask for alms!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many that I dare not say, it is not a problem for one family to scrape together dozens of serf households for you. Especially those big households, who donated three to five hundred households without blinking an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you think it's not enough, you can go to your relative's house for a walk. Anyway, there are not many other things in our family, that is, we have many relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you have a thicker skin, one-tenth of the nobles in the kingdom can get some connections, and you can gather as many people as you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, your kid has a solid family background, so just pay them the price of slaves in the market. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Adrian's suggestion, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. Does this have anything to do with relatives? It's all based on the price of slaves in the market, so he might as well just buy slaves directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that the price of slaves has skyrocketed, and even Hudson is in pain. But now everyone knows that he is doing well, and the price can't be negotiated. Otherwise, the transaction becomes a debt of favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't want to fight with people every now and then. If he owes a debt of favor, he has to bring dry food to help the scene as soon as he is greeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just these things, it's not unacceptable, and it's not a loss to pay off a debt of favor after a fight. What I am most afraid of is that the opponent in the fight is also one of our own, and it will be embarrassing at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the complex relationship network of the Koslow family, there is a high probability that this kind of thing will happen. As far as Hudson could remember, Baron Redman was invited to mediate no fewer than five such conflicts a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of the mediation is unknown. Anyway, Baron Redman is exhausted every time he comes back, and he often shuts himself up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Adrian, you have a wide range of contacts, help me spread the news in the circle, I am willing to exchange iron tools for serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is weapons and equipment or daily iron daily necessities, as long as they can be produced in the territory, they can let them choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exchange is based on the market price, and the transportation cost is mine. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the price of iron products is also high, it is still far from the price of slaves flying in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production of slaves is extremely unstable. Generally speaking, every time a war breaks out between human nations, the price of slaves will drop sharply. If there is peace for a few years, the price will go up again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom seldom engages in wars with human countries, but often fights with orcs, so the slave market is dominated by orcs, and human slaves are all imported from abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rebellion of the Skull and Bones, the human slaves on the market were quickly snapped up, and the orc slaves were mainly some special races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These races all have common characteristics, such as high appearance and weak combat effectiveness, they are mainly for the nobles to have fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of cat girl, fox girl, rabbit girl...not only the price is high, but also not suitable for farming or blacksmithing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that there are tauren, leopard, goblin, pigg, ratman... and hundreds of orc slaves in the north, but these guys are either violent, cunning, or too low in intelligence. The price/performance ratio is not high, and it is not popular in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of those with strong combat effectiveness were sold into the Colosseum, while those with low combat effectiveness were either reduced to magic materials in the hands of magicians, or became sacrifices to evil gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, orc slaves cannot be counted on for the time being. If it can be used, the lords of the Northland will be the first to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just follow suit, there is no need to be a guinea pig.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to suppress the price of slaves, Hudson can only hedge with the high value-added products produced by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this can be regarded as opening up a new market, and it depends on whether everyone is willing to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I helped with this, but you also forged some high-quality weapons and armors! You just produced a bunch of low-quality junk, and it would be shameful to take them out.\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As a northern nobleman, Baron Sith's creed is - if there is a loss, he must find a way to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How is the investigation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith asked indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no warmth in the speech, as if it is an emotionless machine. Only the look of expectation in his eyes betrayed the desire deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The four small branches of the Koslow family gathered together, accompanied by twelve noble families along the way, and the total number of guards totaled more than a thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these people should not all be escorted along the way. After entering the Maple Leaf Territory, only the Koslow family and the three knights attached to the mountain baron remained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make a move, the best place to make a move is at the maple leaf collar. At that time, their guard strength will be weakened to the minimum, and there should be no more than 300 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the enemy has a large number of knights, and that the mountain baron is best at long-range attacks, can restrain heavy cavalry, and there is an earth bear of unknown strength, we have to dispatch at least 600 elites to be sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to lose too much, it's better to join forces with several companies, such as Baron Kettley. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this analysis, Baron Sith almost spat out a mouthful of blood. If this plan is carried out, it is estimated that the rest of my life will have to be accounted for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't know that he and Lord Kettley are at odds? When they were in the Northland, the two had conflicts. Now that they are competitors, it is even more difficult to join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the location of the attack, which is also chosen in the opponent's territory. After the incident, Baron Kettley was the first object of investigation when the kingdom was looking for the murderer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley will only agree if his brain is flooded. If they had joined forces in the past, they might have joined forces and backhanded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send troops to plunder the wealth of nobles, and they deserve to be killed. The laws of the kingdom strictly protect the personal safety of the nobles, which only protect the nobles in a legal state. If you run to kill yourself, your personal safety is not protected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, it's almost common knowledge that Kettley, that bastard, colluded with the Mountain Baron. You still want us to join him, isn't that too long-term?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And what do you judge, to take down a few local nobles, it is necessary to dispatch 600 elites?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If so many people were mobilized at once, wouldn't it directly expose us? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith almost roared and asked three soul questions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A subordinate who was quite clever at first, didn't know what was going on now, but made so many mistakes, it was clear that he would not stop until he was killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sith, don't embarrass Ravesi. The analysis he made may not be wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kettler colluded with the Mountain Baron, that was just a rumor. The credibility of rumors that can make a lot of noise is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two really collude with each other, don't hide it, and wait for the critical moment to trick us, how can they leak the news in advance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the judgment on the strength of the Mountain Baron and his party, I think there is nothing wrong with it. A lion fighting a rabbit needs to use all its strength, not to mention facing the famous bow knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that this person's battle of fame came from stepping on the bones of the cavalry of the Holy See. Although the record of annihilating one thousand enemies is likely to be blown out, but to become famous in one battle, at least dozens of Holy See cavalry must be shot and killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that there is also a great knight, who is under this person's hatred. Ordinary knights can't dodge his arrows at all, let alone soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, this person has been using ordinary standard bows and arrows in the army before, and cannot display the true strength of a sharpshooter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After becoming famous, even if you can't get a magic bow, it is not difficult to get a good elf bow with the connections of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the melee siege is carried out immediately after launching the sneak attack, otherwise this bow knight may cause us a lot of losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it is not easy to sneak attack him. Although this person's record is all on one bow, but he can recover an earth bear, and his own strength will not be much worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have all seen that bear before. It can change into a three-meter-high body, and it has obviously passed the most vulnerable juvenile period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not known exactly what stage it has grown to, but even if it is an Earth Bear that has just passed its infancy, its fighting power will not be weaker than that of a great knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't think the Koslow family has the strength to accelerate an Earth Bear from its infancy to its growth stage in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reality is a bit cruel, I have to admit that there are indeed geniuses in this world. Sixteen or seventeen-year-old great knights, even silver knights, have appeared on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have seen the more than one hundred armored soldiers in this person's hands. Judging from the military appearance alone, it can be roughly judged that its combat effectiveness is very strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guards carried by the nobles of other southeastern provinces are also the elite of each family. Although military training may be insufficient, individual combat effectiveness is not weak. With so many people standing in front, it was enough time for the Mountain Baron to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think even if there are six hundred elites, they may not be able to retain them. Even our fastest war horses can't catch up with the growing Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of the king of the earth is not in vain. It is rumored that as long as the earth bear stands on the ground, it can continuously obtain magical powers from the ground. It has set a record of seven days and seven nights of continuous fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the robbery is successful, as long as the bow knight cannot be left behind. One person and one bear cooperate to launch a sneak attack on us from a distance, and it is difficult for us to retreat unscathed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man's words made Baron Sith lose his temper instantly. Although gold coins are good, they have to be eaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has been going deep into the orc empire all year round. If his head is not bright enough, he will not be able to live now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although deep down in his heart, he believed that the old man had overstated the other party's strength in order to dispel his idea of ​​robbing and killing the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the master of one side, Baron Sith had to consider the issue of cost. Even if the robbery is successful, if the casualties are too heavy, it will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention how to make up for the loss, the Kingdom of Light will not be able to escape the investigation afterwards. As a man of the hour in the two counties, his strength was put on the bright side, and he lost hundreds of elites all at once, and he couldn't hide it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, Uncle Faerun. I won't mess with things I'm not sure about. Among the nobles of the Northland, is there anyone interested in them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because you can't make a move yourself doesn't mean you can't encourage others to make a move. It would be even more perfect if he could take the opportunity to trap his competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are some. When I sent people to investigate, I also found spies from other nobles. However, after investigating the strength of the mountain baron and his party, I am afraid that few have the courage to act.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ravesi replied solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what Baron Sith thinks, as a loyal subordinate, the first thing to do is to answer the boss's questions honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Sith finally gave up the idea of ​​teaming up to rob and kill. On the one hand, there are too many people participating, and the spoils are not enough for everyone to share; on the other hand, they simply cannot trust their teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no betrayal, it was only because the chips in hand were not enough. When it came to his own wealth and life, Sith didn't dare to bet on the integrity of his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of robbing and killing nobles has too much impact. Once it is exposed, even the grand duke's legitimate son can't help it, let alone his illegitimate son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that if I want to control Wright County, this person is my biggest opponent. I can't get rid of him when he is fledgling. It will not be so easy to do it in the future!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategic vision, he still does not lack. Although Hudson's strength is not the strongest in Wright County, his financial resources are definitely among the best among the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there is money, there are soldiers. This is the biggest feature of the Northland. Looking at the entire continent, the same applies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any ambitious noble, after his pockets are bulging, the first thing he does is to expand his military power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't need much technical content, as long as the brain is normal and not messing around, it can produce an elite team by spending money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, don't worry too much. The mountain baron is indeed outstanding in personal ability, but the strength of the Koslow family cannot support his ambition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the choice of fief, it can actually be seen. The Salam mining area can indeed generate huge income in a short period of time, but this income is not sustainable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province lacks high-quality coal, and even if it has mines, it is difficult to forge high-quality weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have all seen the weapons cast by the Mountain Baron, and the quality is comparable to that of the orc empire. It can only make do with equipment for serfs, and putting it in the hands of elite troops is purely reducing combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the peace of the two counties is restored, the huge profits from the sale of weapons will immediately drop sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, just selling some farm tools or daily necessities, the profit will not be too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the feudal nobles in the two counties, the income of the mountain land may be higher, but it is impossible to be as outstanding as it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that this person also saw this, so he wanted to gather the population from the outside world in an attempt to develop the vast area of ​​​​the Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a long-term project, without the continuous investment of hundreds of thousands of gold coins, nothing famous can be developed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, he will spend the next few decades on the development of the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For minor nobles, this is undoubtedly the most correct choice. Once fully developed, it will be enough to bring the Koslow family back to the ranks of middle nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that's all there is to the limit. The strategic focus is on the development of the territory. He no longer has enough energy to compete with you, young master, for the dominance of Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority is to integrate the fiefs as soon as possible. Only by concentrating the strength can Dadir City be restored in the shortest time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the largest city at the southern end of the southeastern province, Dadir City is inherently suitable to become a commercial and trade center, which is our greatest advantage. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the old man said it lightly, as if he didn't take Hader seriously at all, he couldn't hide his envy in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With steady development, one can steadily step into the ranks of middle-class nobles, so why bother so much?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slowness is not important, the key is winning in stability. If ten years is not enough, it will be twenty years, if twenty years is not enough, it will be thirty years, if thirty years is not enough, it will be fifty years, and it will be enough to spend slowly on the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The input-output ratio is indeed low, but for nobles, they should not only focus on short-term economic benefits, but also focus on the long-term future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The upper limit of the Mountain Territory is middle-class nobles, so why not the upper limit of the Dadir Territory? Even if he seized the position of Sheriff, at most he could only support Baron Sith to reach the rank of middle nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Hudson pick up the bargain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This conclusion is actually absurd. Before Hudson moved into the Salam mining area, the efficiency of iron smelting was not so high, and the quality was even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be used to forge farm tools and daily necessities, and even forge low-quality weapons. The income of the mining area is far less than it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After deducting all the expenses of the lord, the balance is at most thousands of gold coins. Wanting to complete the investment of hundreds of thousands of gold coins is simply a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is easy to do, the original lord will do it, and it will not be Hudson's turn to pick up this \"cheap\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, there are still many people in the outside world who are not optimistic about this protracted development plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no one knows which will come first, tomorrow or the accident. It is purely irresponsible to devote all the power of a family to a bottomless development project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the dust settled, the news about the conflict between the kingdom and the Holy See finally spread to the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, everyone finally understood Governor Pierce's intentions. It just makes countless northern Xinjiang noble children feel sad and angry, you should tell me earlier when this happened, we promise not to cause trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first step up was a blow to Sap, exposing everyone's dark history, and causing the already loose alliance to collapse directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once trust is lost, it will be difficult to recover even if you work ten times harder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone could catch their breath, huge fines were thrown down, which weakened everyone's financial resources to the extreme, and they didn't even have the capital to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that now everyone's life is under control, and they must purchase the limited and affordable food provided by the Governor's Mansion. The monthly ration is only so small, whoever dares to do anything, will be ready to go hungry next month!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles were also unhappy, but they didn't have that much resentment towards Earl Pierce. After all, after this round of blows, the main unlucky ones were the northern Xinjiang nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss is biased towards his own people after all. The transmission of this political signal is enough to appease everyone's inner discomfort. Except for a certain Chi Yu who was still aggrieved, most of the local nobles accepted the current result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arriving at the territory smoothly all the way, Hudson was a little suspicious that he was using the heart of a villain to save the belly of a gentleman. Perhaps the nobleman's moral integrity is not as low as he imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the promise still has to be fulfilled. After entertaining with good wine and food, Hudson opened the warehouse and let everyone choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I have screened all of them, and I can't find a piece of high quality if I choose it casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's about his own life. Hudson will not make such a principled mistake. In order to conceal the fact that he was able to forge good weapons out of charcoal, he even bought part of high-quality coal from the outside world at a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not sold externally, that is because the cost is too high. There is nothing wrong with it, Earl Pierce can testify to this, and the excellent weapons made by their family have never been sold outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purchasing sky-high high-quality coal from outside the province, the cost of the manufactured weapons and equipment is only a little lower than the selling price in the world, and does not have the economic value of large-scale sales.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family insists on casting by themselves, the most important thing is that they are not sure about the quality of purchased products. This is a magical world, and there are plenty of tricks for insidious people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone adds materials to the weapons and equipment for sale, it will be very fatal for a big family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is possible to take precautions, the magician can't let the magician check each piece, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have trouble with the skills of the mages, it is better to organize your own people to forge it. Anyway, in the hands of the Dalton family, there is no shortage of iron ore, and it can save a lot of expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the small and medium nobles, there is no need to worry about that. There is also a cost to using dark hands, and they are not worth that price at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to check, you just need to ask someone to help you see if the weapon you are using is cursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about the life and death of ordinary soldiers. If the enemy is willing to spend such a large amount of money on them, it is not difficult to kill them directly and kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A 100-member assassin team is enough to behead 99% of the small and medium-sized nobles. The remaining one percent are the lucky ones who happen not to be at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's approach, although it seems a bit of a fuss, no one will find it strange, after all, it still saves a little money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, quickly cast plate armor! I see that the iron produced in your territory may not be able to make high-precision armor, but it should not be difficult to cast large plate armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the quality is slightly worse, it doesn't hurt too much. As long as it is thick enough, it is not difficult to block ordinary weapons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Visiting the smelting field, Adrian Knight proposed enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Baron Berio and the Guarente knight on the side also rarely expressed their approval of his proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom are obsessed with iron bumps like plate armor. Many powerful nobles have prepared this thing for their private army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The practicability is too low. Unless you prepare in advance, it will be difficult to play a role. If you have a strong family, you can prepare some and keep it at home. It can be used when encountering foreign enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, those dozens of pounds of iron bumps were exhausting enough for soldiers to wear, and it was difficult for them to adapt to long-distance marches. If it is placed on a carriage, it will be too late to wear it when the war breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listen to my advice, this kind of expensive toy is not suitable for poor ghosts like you now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking back the complaints, his heavy armored infantry plan was secretly started. Although there are many disadvantages of plate armor, there is one advantage that is enough - the defense is strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is the magical world. Warriors who have practiced fighting spirit are far stronger than ordinary people. Wearing dozens of pounds of armor, although it is a bit inconvenient, it is not difficult to say that it is even difficult to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three of them were persuaded to give up this idea, because the production capacity of the plate armor was extremely limited. In the territory, there are only three craftsmen who can forge plate armor, with an average monthly output of 30 sets of plate armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy infantry of the family alone has not yet assembled all the equipment, let alone sold it.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 97": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 97: add fire\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Really unable to resist the strong demands of the three, Hudson reluctantly released thirty pairs of heavy armor. It's just such a small amount, and I don't know how they will use it when they take it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three of them never let go of any of the other weapons and equipment. All the equipment produced in recent days has been divided up by the three of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all business, and Hudson has no opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be better if there were fewer complaints about weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson has encountered similar scenes in countless customers and has long been immune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The buyer is the picky one. He keeps complaining about his shortcomings, but his body is still very honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, none of the customers who bought his products gave good reviews, and Hudson no longer has any illusions about taking the word-of-mouth route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Often the more useless the product is sprayed, the larger the final order will be placed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there is no need to undertake after-sales business here, and there is no penalty mechanism for bad reviews. Otherwise, he, the businessman with the most bad reviews in the southeast province, really couldn't get along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You get what you pay for. They are all nine yuan and nine free shipping products, so the quality is naturally not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know how many iron weapons that can be bought with silver coins in the entire Aslant continent, but looking at the southeastern province, only Baron Hudson can lower the price to this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also Hudson's killer feature. Every time the price comparison method is offered, customers can place orders and pay readily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important whether the quality is good or not. They are all prepared for serf soldiers. There is no need to set such a high standard. The key is that it is cheap and can kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money is the courage of a hero. After sending away the three unsightly goods, Hudson accelerated the formulation of the territory development plan, which will be officially launched only after the autumn plowing is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have enough talents in hand, then go out and make plans yourself. The workload in the early stage is not large, and the main work is to open up wasteland. What Hudson needs to do is to select a geomantic land suitable for agricultural production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Salam Mountains are rolling and the terrain is relatively flat, so the early development is relatively easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's goal is not high. To catch up with the opening of 8,000 acres of mountain land before next year's spring plowing, even if it is a phased victory, the specific refinement is to develop a small hill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really a small hill, with a visual drop of no more than 50 meters. It is considered the best cultivated land in the Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are willing to spend your money, you can directly push it into a plain. Of course, the current Hudson is not so domineering. Once excavated, the seemingly inconspicuous small soil volume can be quite a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no construction machinery, and the work is all done manually. There is no human life that cannot be filled in a large project with a million earthworks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    8,000 acres of land reclamation plan, this goal is not too big. Although the young and strong are all in the army and in the mines, Master Hudson not only has serfs, but also livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the pregnant female beast, he also had more than 150 rough horses and 21 cows available, fully worth a thousand strong laborers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Livestock + thousands of local residents, the construction period of half a year, the initial construction of 8,000 mu of terraced fields is completed, theoretically speaking, there is no problem at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to fatten the land, Hudson ordered the collection of human and animal feces in the territory early on, so that the first earthwork in the territory turned out to be a cesspit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the plan will always change. After learning about the pitiful grain yield per mu, the collected manure is first used in autumn plowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is all cultivated land on the plains, and it is not expected to double the output. As long as the yield per mu can exceed 200 pounds, Hudson will be content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the yield of food depends not only on fertility, but also on seeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson can still barely know how to improve the fertility of the land. To improve grain seeds, it is really beyond the scope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the serfs these days are more obedient, and they can do whatever the lord tells them to do. Hudson's first agricultural technological innovation was successfully implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Focused on agriculture, he kept his ears to the outside world. Even if the outside world was arguing about the kingdom and the Holy See, Hudson would not be moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the sky falls, the big man will bear it first. Anyway, no one cares about his opinion, and it will not affect the decision-making of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get involved, at least you have to be at the level of Earl Pierce before you are eligible to express your opinions on military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson is very confident in King Caesar III. With him, the master of ZTE who can save the royal family from danger, the situation will not be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he really fights with the Holy See, with his political skills, he will be able to win a few allies, and he will not be foolish enough to fight the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson even felt that the Holy See did not dare to make a move at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Holy See was not welcomed by the rulers of the mainland countries. When they were caught, they dared to take action against a kingdom, especially when this kingdom was still of great significance to the human world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it is done, it is likely to fall into a situation where everyone shouts and beats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when the Lord of Dawn often appeared holy, the Holy See might be able to withstand the impact of public opinion, but not now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The churches of various countries are almost self-contained, except for the Pope, it is a small Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can guarantee that there will not be any monarch who is too hot-headed to establish a new Holy See. At least Hudson felt that if his king was pushed into a hurry, he would not lack such courage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one tried it, because everyone was still in awe, afraid of causing the Lord of Dawn's displeasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this legendary god. Although he is extremely ruthless in combating heresy, in the recorded information, it seems that he has never interfered with the internal fighting between believers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially since this guy hasn't shown up for thousands of years, there are already many scholars on the mainland who have put forward various arguments to question: \"Theory of the Return of the Gods to the Market\", \"Theory of the Perjury of the Gods\", \"Theory of the Hollowness of the Gods\"...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's true or not. Anyway, the Holy See hates these guys deeply, and I can't wait to deal with them quickly. However, countries still protect these people to death and do not give them a chance to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even a small nobleman like Hudson can know these remarks, which is enough to prove the attitude of the rulers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holy Mountain\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving the news from the Alpha Kingdom, Pius VII was so angry that he almost vomited three liters of blood on the spot. Originally, the purpose of sending people to destroy the evidence was to avoid intensification of conflicts, so as not to affect the plans of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan didn't change quickly. The trouble caused by the blood moon horn has not subsided, and there was a scandal of intercepting and killing the special envoy of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flying dragon cavalry sent out were all wiped out, and the property of the Holy See in the Alpha Kingdom also suffered heavy losses. As for the tithes, redemption rolls, donations from believers, etc. that should have been paid, it is estimated that there will be no copper coins in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Blake, is that what you promised me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of property is nothing more than that, the key is that the Holy See's already unbearable reputation is now getting worse again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he succeeded to the throne, he has implemented a reputation-washing plan for more than ten years, and this wave can directly declare bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanation is meaningless, the Alpha Kingdom has revealed everything that should be said and should not be said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An interception operation made things completely passive. No matter how many explanations are given, the outside world will think that the Alpha Kingdom Mission got the Blood Moon Horn, which led to the interception and killing of the Holy See Flying Dragon Cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Pius VII himself thought so. Otherwise, there is no grievance or hatred, and he will kill the king's special envoy when he is full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't think there was anything wrong with Karlis's self-assertive actions. The only problem was that he was not careful enough to expose himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only gratifying thing is that the Horn of the Blood Moon did not fall into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom, saving a little bit of face for the Holy See. Otherwise, the matter of supporting the cult organization will be completely exposed to the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Pius VII thought the sacrifice of the Dragon Cavalry was worth it. It is one thing to be recognized, but another concept to directly produce evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is deceiving oneself and others, the Holy See also needs this fig leaf. As long as they have this fig leaf, they can have the cheek to deny it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it has no practical significance, even if you know that it is your own fault for political things, sometimes you have to stick to it and refuse to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can hold on externally, but internal responsibilities must be investigated. Where there are people, there are disputes, and the Holy See is not monolithic. Without a reasonable explanation, all parties may be unable to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dragon cavalry sent by the whole army was wiped out, and the dead are not responsible. The younger brother is not good at doing things, and the boss also needs to take responsibility. This not-so-black blame naturally fell on Blake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coincidentally, the Horn of the Blood Moon also fell out of the hands of the Judgment Knights, and it was involved from the beginning to the end. Blake, who had committed crimes and meritorious deeds, had no room for defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this matter is my trial of the Knights' incompetence. As the leader, I cannot escape the responsibility.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very bachelor took the responsibility, Blake turned his expectant eyes to all his colleagues, hoping that everyone would give him a hand at this time for the sake of old friendship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether he has carried out public relations in private, no one knows. Anyway, Blake is now a good believer who has the courage to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Captain Blake is certainly responsible, but the ones who really need to be responsible for this matter are the guys guarding the Blood Moon Horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Flying Dragon Cavalry just wiped their **** for them. Although their actions were inadvertently exposed, they finally hid the Blood Moon Horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is thousands of miles away from us, and there are several countries blocking it halfway. No matter how dissatisfied they are, they can only shout a few times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Active industries have been frozen by them. The worst situation is just like this, as long as other countries don't get involved, it's almost time to end the matter. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cardinal Sauron's words directly made Pius VII roll his eyes. Just beg for mercy if you help, but how can you say it out of his mouth, it's to the point of lying down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is indeed the reality that the Holy See needs to face now. The Alpha Kingdom cannot reach the Holy See. In other words, it can be understood that the Holy See cannot do anything to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling all the way to the past, that is a child's naive idea. We are all mature politicians who know how to weigh the pros and cons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the person responsible for being thrown out, it can only be considered their bad luck. Although they were punished last time, they were not executed after all. Now someone needs to take responsibility, so they can only reluctantly let them do it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to take down a senior member of the Holy See and break the balance of power among the various factions in the Church for such a small matter, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you really want to deal with Blake, you have to find a suitable replacement. Otherwise, wouldn't the Knights of Judgment want to mess up if they took people down rashly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the main battle corps of the Holy See, Pius VII must not allow the Knights of Judgment to fall into chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Sauron is right. Blake really only needs to take secondary responsibility. However, his subordinates messed up things one after another. Shouldn't Captain Blake reflect on himself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it due to ignorance of people, inappropriate employment, or limited ability to take on the heavy responsibility of managing the Knights of Judgment;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All in all, Captain Blake must have a clear self-positioning to ensure that he will not make similar mistakes next time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing his old enemy speak, Blake knew he was in trouble. It seems that he is allowed to choose by himself, but in fact he has no choice at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The charge of \"perfunctory\" must never be admitted, it is a matter of principle. It is a blasphemy to believe in not working hard for the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unknown and improper employment are all manifestations of his own limited ability, and he has definitely worn the hat of \"incompetence\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he escapes this catastrophe, his right to speak in the Holy See will be greatly reduced in the future, and it may even affect the status of the Judgment Knights in the Church.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Commander Gulei, for reminding me. I will definitely reflect on it deeply. However, regardless of whether I have the ability to take up the current position, it is the internal affairs of the Judgment Knights, and you don't need to worry about the leader of the Judgment Knights.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people under his hand are on the bar again, and Pius VII has mixed joys and sorrows. Inherited to the present, the Holy See has already changed in nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major institutions in the religion are all severely inbreeding. In name, the clergy dedicated everything to the gods, and as a result, illegitimate children were everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many positions have started the hereditary mode. Pius VII wanted to change this situation, but he couldn't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, that's how he came to be Pope. If it wasn't for his ancestors who had served as the pope, the power in the church was deeply rooted, and the position of the pope would not be his turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I benefit from this set of rules, so it is too embarrassing for him to change the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the major forces in the church check and balance each other, and there are many conflicts among them. Otherwise, he, the pope, would have a difficult life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, you two don't make trouble. Let me calm down this farce with the Alpha Kingdom first, and all the losses caused by it will be borne by the Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care how to solve the resulting gap, even if you, Blake, pay for it yourself, you have to make it up for me. Anyway, the strength of the Judgment Knights cannot be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Alpha Kingdom, it has caused us so much trouble, and it cannot make them feel better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't Caesar III a taunt, so find something for him to do so that he won't be happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire has been silent for so long, it's time for them to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few years ago, the Lion Clan changed the king, and the new Lion King had already sharpened his sword and wanted to invade the south, but because Bi Meng Huang was too old to lift a sword himself, and he didn't want to see other people's achievements in battle, so he made excuses stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Emperor Bimeng is very old. Once this old immortal dies, the political situation of the five emperors of the Orc Empire will be broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the current Crown Prince Bimon is also old, and there is a high probability that he will continue this old political line. If we want them to invade the south, we need to add fire to them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that provoking the orcs to invade the south is as natural as eating and drinking water, and they don't care about the losses caused to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one was surprised. Obviously, the Holy See has done similar things more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Holy See started the war thousands of years ago, mainly to guide the spread of the human race, spread the glory of the Lord of Dawn, and by the way, compete for living space for the race; but now the Holy See started the war just to eliminate dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured. I promise not to let the operation of the Judgment Knights be affected in any way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake hastily promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is difficult to live without money, the first task now is to keep your position. Insufficient funds, the big deal is to cut expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle and lower classes are the ones most affected. No matter how they change, the life of the big shots above will not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at Blake, he seemed very satisfied with his statement, and Pius VII took advantage of the situation and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you are so confident, then the affairs of the Orc Empire will also be handed over to your Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The glory of the Holy See cannot be violated. Any behavior that dares to provoke the majesty of the Holy See must be severely punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care what method you use, the orc empire must launch a southward invasion within three years. If you can't do it, you can abdicate yourself and go to the ascetic camp! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ascetic Monk Camp is composed of a group of the most devout believers in the Lord of Dawn, and has always been the most sacred place in the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just publicity. For the leader, no one wants to go to the ascetic camp to experience life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The canon rules are extremely strict, and the life of simple food and drink all day is enough to make any normal person collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Blake only felt a pressure rushing towards him. Three years seems to be a long time, but it seems too short to guide the policy direction of a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the old man Bi Menghuang is still alive, as long as this most prestigious old guy doesn't nod his head, it will be very difficult to pass the South invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing surprising, the biggest achievement of Emperor Beamon is that he invaded the south and seized a large area of ​​the Alpha Kingdom. As he was old and unable to lead the troops south, he naturally did not want to start a new war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wins the battle, the prestige of the other emperors will increase greatly, which will shake his position as the number one person in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he lost the battle, the land he seized earlier might have to be returned, and his outstanding achievements would be washed away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A **** war to win or lose, any mature politician would object to. Even if they really want to fight, they have to wait until he dies, so as not to affect his reputation before and after his life.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 98": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 98: brothers get together\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    \"Master, the Eldest Young Master and the Second Young Master are here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the servant's ambiguous words, Hudson almost thought that two sons had popped up. Immediately, he realized that the \"Eldest Young Master, Second Young Master\" in his mouth should be his elder brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of such a messy name is most likely due to habit. After all, it was always called that when I was in my hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that after coming to the mountain area, Hudson was automatically upgraded to a master, and the servant obviously followed the habit deep in his heart when addressing the two elder brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have time to worry about so much, and it's normal to have a bad brain. Otherwise, how could he be a servant?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had any intelligence, he would have been promoted to a more important position long ago based on his years of following Hudson on the saddle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Arrange the reception first, and I'll go there after I wash up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of joy from the bottom of my heart seems to be an instinct. In the memories left by the original owner, both elder brothers took good care of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an heir, Hudson does not reject these feelings. After all, human beings live in groups, if they really have no feelings at all, then life is too tiring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for some hesitation in my heart, I didn't know how to face it, maybe I didn't even need to wash away, and I would have rushed to meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My brother, in fact, does not need to pay so much attention to etiquette. Faux pas doesn't really matter as long as no outsiders are present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cleansing was completed quickly, and Hudson also adjusted his mentality. It is enough to follow the heart, there is no need to act too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of familiar people, the more you cover up, the easier it is to leave a hole. Anyway, we have been separated for several years, and so many things have happened in the middle, it is normal to have some changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nelson, Evora, long time no see!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last time, my father said that he wrote a letter to summon you two to come back. He thought we should have met long ago, but he didn't expect it to be delayed until now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I haven't seen each other for three years. I have to say that in the world of nobles, there is really less gathering and more separation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the Koslow family had gained too much this time, they needed to concentrate their strength to deter the villain. It is estimated that the three brothers still don't know when they will meet each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention thousands of miles away, often hundreds of miles are two worlds. There is no major business, and few people travel hundreds of miles to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a letter contact, there are very few. After all, the cost of letters these days is also very high. There is no special postal agency, so you can only send someone to deliver it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's been a while, but Hudson, you've changed a lot!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That day, when I received a letter from my father, I thought it was a prank. Who would have imagined that in just three years, a young man who used to be lazy in knight training would suddenly become a well-known mountain baron. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson responded with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is happy for Hudson from the bottom of his heart. As the eldest son in the family, the baronship has been bound since birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the succession law of the Alpha Kingdom, as long as Nelson does not commit suicide and is not a practicing idiot, he can inherit the title smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Born with a golden key in his mouth, naturally there is no need to be jealous. The brothers are capable, and the strength of the family continues to grow, which is good for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Nelson undoubtedly set a good example, laying the foundation of \"brothers and brothers respectful\" for the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I can remember, Hudson's knight training since he was a child was completed under the supervision of his elder brother. To put it simply, it was a lot of beatings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in addition to strict requirements on the younger brothers in terms of practice, they are very caring in terms of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the eldest son in the family and the first heir to the baron, Nelson obviously has more resources to enjoy. Nelson has shared these good things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including after the stepmother entered the door, being able to behave so well is actually due to the elder brother's credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an heir, there are still many privileges. The servants dare to neglect the second son like Hudson, but they absolutely dare not offend the heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, in Hudson's memory, before the eldest brother left, he warned all the servants in the mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those who defected to the Baroness were directly beaten up by him and paralyzed. Hemiplegia in the true sense, he met the Lord of Dawn directly in less than a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The following changes are most likely due to Baron Redman's good move. Sons and servants are obviously not in the same class, and unstable elements are obviously not allowed to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect of Liwei is very obvious. Even after two or three years, the servants in the mansion are still very well-behaved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that the eldest young master can really kill people when he is angry, even if it is the baroness's cronies, his death will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's really like this. Nelson has been away from home for three years, and I have been away for less than two years. The changes in your boy are really unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson, you are not interesting enough. If we hadn't returned home, we wouldn't have known that so many changes had taken place inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that you are too soft-hearted, right? Raisul dared to steal your life essence, but you didn't beat him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But don't worry, I'm the best at beating up my brother. We greeted Pastor Quinn, and we will not treat that kid, at least he will have to lie down for half a month. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Evola's words, Hudson's expression changed, as if he had awakened an unbearable past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Beat your younger brother as soon as possible, otherwise you won't be able to beat him.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This classic line is the shadow of Hudson's childhood. If it weren't for this guy who has been heartless and behaved in all aspects, he would have suspected that he was possessed by some senior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, Evola! If you can't speak, don't speak, no one will think you are dumb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, you're doing great. There is no need to argue with a useless person, we are not from the same world, ignoring is the best choice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a glorious thing for one's own brothers to fight among themselves. It's too late to cover up, so how can I take the initiative to mention it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson still heard the implication. It was nothing more than the fact that Lesur was abandoned by his family, and it was estimated that he would be sent away when he became an adult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that Koslow's surname cannot be used. After all, a guy who is not even a knight can only embarrass himself if he goes out in the name of his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason Hudson is very clear is that he has risen too fast, and family members feel that keeping Lesur is not conducive to family unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is not ruled out that family resources are tight and unable to support the development of so many children at the same time, so they simply give up the one with the worst character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all Hudson's fault. In order to support the development of the Mountain Territory, Baron Redman also spent his money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early stage, for the sake of the territory, the expenses of giving gifts and entrusting relationships were not small, and the support in the later stage was not interrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of the serfs who came out with Hudson went back, and even their family members were sent here. Not only was it given to people, but hundreds of thousands of pounds of grain were also delivered one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The increased overhead is not the only one. The tense situation in the two counties of Wright and Wyton also forced the branches of the Koslow family to expand their armaments in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of concern about the current situation, Baron Redman also expanded the guard to 500 people. Although the soldiers are composed of serfs, which can save a lot of military pay, military expenditures still skyrocketed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ever-expanding expenses will inevitably cause financial constraints in the family. Based on Hudson's understanding of Lesul, the younger brother, who has no winks, presumably ran to his father again to show his negative presence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With other family members playing side drums, it is not surprising that Baron Redman, who has many sons, let go in a fit of anger and made a decision to give up his most ineffective son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this is also the hole Hudson dug before leaving home to create a \"stupid\" image for Laisuer in front of Baron Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the concept is deeply ingrained, any mistakes will be magnified. Over time, the relationship between father and son is exhausted, and it's time to explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Nelson. Arguing with a fool will only bring us down for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't talk about these bad things, it's rare to be able to get together, let's talk about how you have lived these years. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said generously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this wave, he is really not going to care about it. If people are defrauded until they lose their noble status, even if they can survive, they will have to spend the rest of their lives in torment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Leader, in order to complete the autumn plowing task as soon as possible, Baron Kettley was forced to let the soldiers put down their armor and go to work together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is very common in the entire Aslant continent. During the slack season, military training is carried out, and when the farming season is busy, they go home to farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not no troops that are 100% off-duty, but they are only a very small number after all. Most of the army has a part-time job as a farmer, and everyone is used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the busy scene, Baron Kettley was already immersed in the joy of harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf collars are all good fertile fields in the world, and the grain output can be 70% to 80% higher than that of the land in northern Xinjiang. In terms of \"income\", one mu can cover several mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he soon became unhappy. It was just a division of a stream, and the autumn plowing on the opposite side had already been completed first. Only a few scattered women remained in the field, holding baskets and sowing seeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happiness is all compared. It is also arable land, and animals are not comparable to human power after all. Even the strongest soldier is no better than a poor horse in plowing the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Baron Kettley doesn't have horses, but all he has are precious war horses. He can't let the horses plow the land, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although war horses are not completely unable to plow the land, it is just a bit expensive. If he accidentally ruined a horse, he would die of pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coming out of the Northland, the number of war horses in his hands is constantly decreasing. If the losses continue, I am afraid that the cavalry will eventually become infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoning this unreliable idea, Baron Kettley frowned and asked, \"Uncle Holman, can't you buy farm cattle and poor horses around here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who cares about who owns the land. According to the current cultivation speed, it would be very difficult for Maple Leaf to complete the cultivation before the seasons change, let alone the enclave outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A season of neglect is a loss. Baron Kettley couldn't bear to watch the wealth that should belong to him go away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is the same, that's fine. However, his good neighbor had already completed the cultivation of the territory first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't talk about buying cattle, even if it is renting cattle, no one will agree. Now those who have cattle are all local nobles. Even if they pay a big price, no one will rent them to us.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to find the cattle, he really did his best. It's a pity that these means of production are all controlled by the nobles, and they are rarely seen in the market on weekdays, let alone now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Local aristocrats can also rely on their connections to find solutions from relatives and friends, and they, outsiders, will be caught blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to have money, people would rather exchange it for favors than earn their few gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where's that greedy vampire next door, he does all the business?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley asked indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson exchanged population for food, but he was miserably cheated. Because he could not hand over enough population, Baron Kettley was severely punished by Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The extra fines far exceed the value of the food in exchange. Especially when he learned that the Governor's Mansion was selling cheap food, he was even more furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regret is useless, business is business. No one thought that Earl Pierce would use thunder to suppress the dispute between the two counties because of the unexpected change in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal logic, as the lord of the southeastern province, Earl Pierce only needs to watch the excitement while fueling the flames behind the scenes, and watching them fight internally is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a shot is to be made, it will be after all parties have decided the winner. Pick a few big winners and beat them, and you can play nice in front of a lot of losers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The misjudgment caused by poor information made Baron Kettley make a loss-making business. Willing to take the bet, Kettley is not someone who can afford to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just too embarrassing for him to treat his good neighbor who cheated him with a normal heart. Acting in front of outsiders is enough, but if you continue to pretend in front of your own people, it will be too tiring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I personally went over and asked. Baron Hudson is busy organizing manpower to open up wasteland, and there are no extra animals to rent out.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman's words made Kettley more envious and jealous. It is difficult for my own family to complete the autumn plowing smoothly, and the opposite party actually has enough energy to organize people to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is also true that the area of ​​cultivated land in mountainous areas is small. Just tens of thousands of acres of land on the plain cannot support tens of thousands of people in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to purchase a large amount of food from the outside world, you can only ask for land from the \"big mountain\". The endless Salam Mountains are the land reserve of the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Hudson family is not the only aristocrat who has the conditions to ask for land from the \"Mountain\". The three nearby knights are also eligible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that these three unlucky children have not yet completed the primitive accumulation of capital. The ancestral industry is too busy to fight alone, and it is simply unable to organize manpower to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's really cheap for him! Nuo Da's Salam Mountains have become his back garden, and he doesn't even have a competitor.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory was the first they chose. If they had known that the Salam Mountains were a treasure, they would have robbed them no matter what! Why did you choose Maple Leaf Town?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all the \"mountain range\" that misled him. Although he knew that there were mines in the Salam Mountain Range, he finally chose the wealthy Maple Leaf Territory because he could not support himself in food and was afraid of being blocked by competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if he really chose the Salam mining area, it is estimated that only the mining area is left in his territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they chose the place first, the power to demarcate the specific boundaries is in the hands of the Governor's Office.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was able to pick up a bargain because the Koslow family had many relatives and friends, a wide network of contacts, and good public relations in the early stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Switched to Ketley, no one would dare to accept gifts even if they wanted to. Not being deliberately targeted is considered caring, let alone helping him seek benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, you don't have to envy them. Count the days, the family should have received news of the situation here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other respects, it is difficult to provide you with great help. But those ordinary orc slaves, the family is not lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just say hello to the slave hunting team below, and let them take it with them when they move next time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But can you really domesticate these orcs into qualified farmers? If the domestication is not successful, it will be a waste of work! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman changed the subject. He didn't want to see his nephew in front of him, making himself a powerful enemy because of jealousy, that would only ruin him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Holman. Not all orc races are stubborn, there are also many timid races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I was in the Northland, I tried to domesticate them. Although most of them fail, there are also times of success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't too close to the Orc Empire, everyone was worried that it would stimulate the Orc Empire, and I'm afraid there would have been Orc slaves everywhere in the North.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that the Orc Empire also had agriculture. Although the crops they grow are different, that also proves that they have the potential to be farmers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if farming is not enough, they can be pulled out to fight, and they will not lose everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have a hunch that the conflict between the Kingdom and the Holy See will not be fought this time. I estimate that after a year or so of heat, the two sides will die down. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many people turn pale when they mention orcs, thinking that orcs are very powerful. Only those who grew up in the Northland know that the orcs are actually a group with a very severe differentiation between the upper limit and the lower limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A powerful orc race, each member's combat effectiveness is beyond the charts. For example: Beamon family. Anyone who pulls an adult Behemoth is a strong mainlander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weak races, such as ratmen, piggies, goblins, rabbitmen... all of them are as timid as mice, and their fighting power is not as good as that of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the orc empire mainly stems from the strength of the five royal families. The countless races below have extremely serious internal strength differentiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the orcs were as powerful as in the legend, the Alpha Kingdom would have been destroyed long ago, and it would be impossible to sustain it until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, it's good if you have success in your heart. But those races that are too lazy don't need to waste time. Even if they can be domesticated, they are still wasting food.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Holman. I will pay attention to this aspect. I don't dare to take those wastes that only eat dirt.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Baron Kettley still had some lingering fears, as if awakening some disgusting memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world's great wonders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc empire with various races, there are all kinds of messy races. After countless years of survival of the fittest, all races have evolved their own way of survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many tricks, only you can't think of it, there is nothing they can't do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who make a living from farming and hunting are normal creatures. Those who live on leaves and weeds can only show that they have retained their original living habits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are always some alternative races that have evolved all kinds of strange talents. For example: You can eat soil for a living.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Their families are thousands of miles away, and no matter how they ask for help, they will be beyond their reach. The little friends who came together were all too busy to take care of themselves, and they could only take care of themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the soldiers were sent to cultivate the land, a large amount of land was forced to be abandoned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of human slaves in the market has skyrocketed, and people like Hudson who have mines at home are scared back, let alone poor lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are wealthy, you can only purchase a small amount. Large-scale procurement is no longer a matter of price, but that it is simply not available on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past two years, no major war broke out in any country on the mainland. The slaves that are now on the market are only transferred out by occasional slave owners who are short of money and need capital turnover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, great nobles would not sell their slaves, which might inadvertently reveal some of their secrets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering a loss of land abandonment, everyone naturally had to find a way to solve it. Some entrusted merchants to purchase livestock, and some targeted orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if there are two families. When dozens of families gather together, it finally causes a quantitative change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the neighbors capturing ordinary slaves, they thought that there were new buyers for orc slaves. At that time, countless followers followed suit, and the slave trade on the border prospered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of tribesmen were captured, which quickly attracted the attention of the orc tribe. Facing the vicious slave hunting team, the small tribe was powerless and could only report to the higher levels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally reported to Prince Butzweig who was on duty at the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to find out which mage is crazy, or which cult organization is going to make trouble again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder Butzweig thinks this way. In the past, the human race's slave hunting was all for races with good looks and low combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is different, like the tauren, kobold, ratmen, goblins, piggies, goblins... all have a large number of people missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few races with a little fighting power, the rest are weak chickens among weak chickens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of status, these races are like slaves in the human world, even worse than slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least slaves can create wealth, and most of the races here are useless except to waste food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in the eyes of the proud Prince Beamon-Butzweig, the arrest of these races by the human race is collecting trash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Prince Butzweig secretly despised these guys for their stupidity. Compared with the money for hiring a slave team, you can buy more in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made these races useless except for magic experiments and blood sacrifices to evil gods?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, these races are not good choices for magic materials. They are chosen as materials mainly because other races are not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magicians are just a little fanatical about magic experiments, but it doesn't mean they are really crazy. An experiment that consumed hundreds of thousands of souls, if other races were used, it would have been unknown how many times they would have died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the evil gods, it's hard to say. They have all become evil gods, and no one knows what their appetite is. Maybe one of them is different, and maybe they like this one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But most of the evil gods are clean freaks. Compared with these garbage races, they prefer creatures with pure souls as sacrifices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send troops to protect these tribes? That's purely overthinking. The orc empire often cleans up these garbage races, mainly because they multiply too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking piggies as an example, they can reproduce one to three times a year, and each litter can range from five or six to as many as a dozen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many births, but the survival rate is still very high. Almost 80% of them can live to adulthood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meat is eaten when meat is available, and whole grains are good when there is no meat. Grass on the ground and leaves on trees can also be eaten to make do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cubs can reach adulthood in less than two years, and then continue to join the breeding army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, a female piggie can give birth to a regiment for a lifetime, and with the addition of offspring and grandchildren, it is directly a legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar to those with high reproductive ability, there are ratmen and goblins... They all live in one litter, which makes the great Behemoths despise and envy at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no limit, flooding is a matter of minutes. In order to maintain the ecological balance of the orc empire, the five royal families had to implement family planning for these races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no restriction one day, it means that the Southern Invasion War is about to start. Every time a war breaks out, these races are the cannon fodder of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Allocate a wooden stick, and you can go to the battlefield. Other weapons are completely wasted in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment are also important parameters for judging the combat effectiveness of the orc army. Generally speaking, the more heavily armed, the stronger the combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, Hudson is taking his two elder brothers to visit his own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knocking on the mines constantly, playing the most pleasing music; the bustling land reclamation army composes the warmest melody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two of them were almost drooling. They both had seen the world, and they knew very well that Hudson was going to smash the Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is just a Baronie, perhaps decades later it will evolve into a Viscounty, and the Salam Mountains have this potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you are really generous! Open up 8,000 acres of wasteland in half a year. If you continue to develop at this rate, within five years, the area of ​​arable land in the territory will exceed that of the family's century-old business.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson couldn't help but sigh with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard that my brother's territory is developing very fast, but I didn't expect it to be so fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the pig iron production capacity has not returned to its peak period, the income brought by the mine far exceeds that of the previous lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to continue to increase pig iron production, mainly because interests do not allow it to do so. If you want to earn the high premium brought by iron products, you must give up the pig iron business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high income of the mine has supported the rapid development of the territory. The only limitation is the lack of manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no such shortcoming, perhaps the land reclamation plan will not be 8,000 mu, but several 8,000 mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This speed is still a bit slow. The mainland is already a bit unbalanced, not to mention the disputes between the kingdom and the Holy See, our old neighbors orcs alone are not the masters of peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although we are unwilling to admit it, it is indeed because of the immortal life of Emperor Bimeng that we have had these decades of peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next year will be his 300th birthday, which is rare for Bimon at this age. Unless he can break through the sanctuary before he dies, it will only be a matter of these two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether he breaks through before he dies, or dies directly, there will be a new round of war in Northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not only an opportunity for you and my brother, but also our doom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the family is not bad in the circle of small and medium aristocrats, but looking at the battlefield in the northern border, I am afraid that it is the fate of being cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to be reduced to a speck of dust in the war and disappear with the wind, you can only find ways to improve your strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they don't know the situation on the front line, those guys in northern Xinjiang are starting to prepare for the back road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, they have no confidence in winning this war. The Northern Expedition, which was so loudly shouted in the kingdom to recover the lost land, was probably just a slogan of a group of politicians. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These words are mainly for Evola. Among the three brothers, he is the second child who has not been found yet, so it is impossible not to panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obtaining a territory is a low-probability event. If you get nothing, you can't really live with your brothers, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is normal in other families, but not in the Koslow family. There has been no such precedent in the past 100 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the business fails, they will choose to defect to one of the nobles and continue to accumulate capital for the next generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cousin Adrian Knight is an example. If he didn't work for the Dalton family in the previous generation and made enough credit, he wouldn't be able to inherit the territory of a hapless relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of operation is suitable for peaceful times, slowly waiting for the favor of the Lord of Dawn, but it is not suitable for wartime, especially the racial war of large-scale invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the rise and fall of the kingdom, no noble can survive alone. Even if it is a big noble, it has to spend all its money to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The glory of nobles is poured out of blood and fire, especially the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, who have fought fiercely with orcs for many years, which has increased their sanctity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For small and medium-sized nobles, the benefits of this sanctity are still invisible, but if it is placed on Caesar III, he can ignore the Pope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The legitimacy of the throne comes from the tranquility of the ancestors guarding the frontiers of the human race. Regardless of whether the Holy See approves it or not, it is recognized by all countries in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the current Holy See dare not deny the legitimacy of Caesar III's throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because in the ancient \"Bible\", which is said to be written by the Lord of Dawn, there is a clear definition of such achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revision does not exist. In a world with gods, any relationship with gods is sacred and inviolable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, if you have something to say, just say it! This guy has grown everything, but he has no brains.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all born to the same parents, but the difference in IQ is really not ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also came out to make a living, the third child has opened up a foundation, but the second child must be taken by him personally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that Evola would be a little stimulated this time, but it turned out that he was completely overthinking. For a heartless person, it is obviously impossible to think of this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Hudson's hints are very obvious, it's a pity that Evola just doesn't know that these words are said specifically to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson was also very helpless. Although my second brother was quite simple and honest in my memory, I didn't expect to be so simple and honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the aristocratic world of intrigue and deceit, there are very few such simple and honest people. Perhaps the ingenuity and wisdom have all grown up on the boss, and before he crossed over, the original owner was also doing badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are a little shrewd, there will be no farce where the life essence is swapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leisul below is even more stupid. He has no ability at all, and he wants to break the rules of the game. He is a giant baby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about the two little ones in the back? At least they didn't show it before Hudson left home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are really smart, even if you are only happy for Baron Redman, you have to show a brotherly love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the show is not successful, it is still a bonus, because hypocrisy can make a person get along better in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a smart one, but that's normal. Most of the aristocrats were not very good when they were young, and they matured slowly after experiencing many things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evora, the obvious lack of social beating. If you suffer a few more losses and be fooled a few more times, you will probably know that you will be more careful when you encounter problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let him think about it slowly. This kind of thing can only be realized slowly. If we help him now, we are harming him.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some teammates are really hard to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mingming clearly told him what he should do now if he wants to obtain the fiefdom. It's a pity for Evora, really ran to worry about the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a good thing to have a sense of responsibility, it is the most correct choice to do what you do with your identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc invasion is obviously something that big shots should care about. As a small person following the times, it is king to find ways to improve one's own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's enough for the two of you! You are so weird, it makes me look like an idiot. Isn't it that the orcs are about to invade, so prepare in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How big of a deal is this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You lords and heirs of lords will definitely go to the battlefield by then. As an idle knight, whether I want to join the battle or not depends on my mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you think I'm in the way, if you don't want to take me with you, just tell me, and I won't cause trouble for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a big deal to go abroad for a stroll, and come back after the war is over. As for worrying you so much? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A very powerful explanation, Hudson was speechless. Suddenly he found that Evora was not useless, at least he knew the danger was coming and avoided it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as people are alive, there is hope. The competition in the Alpha Kingdom is so fierce, the biggest problem is that there are too many noble children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If after a big war, the nobles in the country die in sevens and eights, the opportunity will come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe you don't need to go to the battlefield to take over the title from a hapless relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the Koslow family's huge relative network as an example, every time there is a war, some people will definitely lose their homes. Calculated from the probability, it seems that the absolute possibility of inheriting is greater than the probability of winning a territory from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, Evora, I have to apologize to you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turns out that you are not really stupid, you just don't like to use your brain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actually, this plan is not bad either. It's better to prepare one more backhand than to be taken over by others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he really supported Evola to go out and hide. After all, it was really dangerous on the northern border battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each war broke out, and the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom did not reduce their staff by one-third, and they did not wait for it to end. Especially in the last war, the number of nobles in the country dropped by 70%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nelson doesn't need to be persuaded. A master with great ambitions will not give up easily before experiencing setbacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is almost a common problem of all \"talented people\". Including Hudson himself is no exception, and now he also wants to make a career.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arbor County, since reading the letter in his hand, Viscount Oran's face suddenly became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is the news accurate? The missing skeleton lord has really appeared again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he hasn't seen the market, but he has personally experienced the lethality of Skull and Bones, so he can't help but worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last wave of Skull and Bones rebellion directly destroyed two counties. Although Earl Pierce let it go, it was more due to the strength of Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I suddenly heard that the culprit who caused the Skull and Bones rebellion suddenly appeared in my sphere of influence, so I can't help being nervous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount, this information was bought by Florian Knight with his life. The fifty-seven soldiers accompanying him also fell to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Baron Pedro, Cavaliers Torrance, and Cavaliers Rudneve, who returned from the trade in the Mountain Territory, happened to pass by with a large group of troops, I am afraid they would not have even received this news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was also confirmed from their mouths that the person who shot was wearing a mask and was very powerful, very similar to the legendary Skeleton Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the enemy is too cunning, and they leave immediately when they see a large group of people, without any hesitation. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged knight hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Able to kill fifty-seven soldiers plus a knight, such a master can't be found in the entire southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the noble camp, there are only a few high-level cult organizations left, and the Skeleton Lord is undoubtedly one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is a vendetta or a cult organization is not important now. As long as the suspicion points to the Skeleton Lord, it must be treated with caution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Immediately send someone to report the information we have to the Governor's Office, and tell the Governor that the skeletons will make a comeback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Order the nobles in the county to strengthen their vigilance to prevent the Skull and Bones from causing chaos. Especially for those knight leaders who are not strong enough, it is best to gather together with several neighbors, so as not to give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether it is true or false, he must treat it as true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I thought about organizing a patrol to arrest the Skeleton Lord, but I gave up after thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader of the cult is not easy to mess with, it is best to be able to drive people out. Even if you can't drive them away, wait until the Governor's Mansion sends someone over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you act rashly, you will be in a hurry, and if you don't do it, you will drag him down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many such negative cases, and the cautious Viscount Oran does not want to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, he ordered again: \"Now that the autumn plowing is over, let me organize the young and strong serfs to practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to place an order with the Mountain Baron, I want to purchase 2,000 spears, 500 broadswords, 200 warhammers, 200 battleaxes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Viscount Oran didn't like the pile of junk produced by Hudson, but he was so stimulated by the Skeleton Lord who appeared in the head, and suddenly found that his military strength was insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serf soldiers who have just put down their hoes are not very effective in combat, but after being armed and trained a little, they can still be used to guard the castle.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Didn't you agree to act secretly and don't cause trouble?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the nobles in the entire Arbor County are moving, and perhaps it won't be long before this range will expand to the southeastern province. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing a little knight is nothing, and dozens of soldiers are even more negligible. But it should never be, never should be, it should not be exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Callis's identity was not disclosed, but he, the boss, was blamed. So much so that the Skeleton Lord doesn't dare to stand up now, lest he be bumped into by the nobles who are all soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Master, I don't want to be exposed either! But that guy had met me before and questioned me as soon as he came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My temporary identity can't stand up to sales at all, and it's gone in a few words. That guy directly ordered to take people, I have to resist! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleeting time is unfavorable, and everything goes wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that behind the masked man was the support of a bunch of great nobles. After joining in, he could avoid the pursuit and killing of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that he was completely overthinking. Putting on the mask really opened up a new life—the life of Dongzang XZ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't reveal your identity, you won't be hunted down by the Alpha Kingdom. But once the identity is revealed, it is the current situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called support of the great nobles is pure nonsense. Although their current career is sacred, but based on the bad things they did before, who would believe that they are anti-Holy See before they have made some achievements?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The majestic \"Skeleton Lord\" is actually no different from him, and they are both the most wanted criminals of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Carliss' makeup skills are not bad. It's a pity that Knight Florian is a former member of the Fifth Army, and he has witnessed him pretending to be aggressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't recognize him at a glance, he was suspicious. It was bad luck for Florian, who mistook him for some low-class thief, otherwise he would not have foolishly ordered to arrest him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The man was not caught, but unfortunately he lost his life in vain. If it weren't for the appearance of other noble teams, scaring away Karlis, I'm afraid they wouldn't even have a chance to leave a last word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, it seems that you and the Horn of the Blood Moon are at odds. Since the nobles in the southeast province have been disturbed, let's stop for now when investigating the Horn of the Blood Moon!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, you should not go out for activities. It is best to leave the southeast province for a while, and come back after the weather calms down. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he had high hopes for Karlis, but now it proves that ability and success are completely different concepts. As long as you are unlucky, you can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of the Horn of the Blood Moon, Karliss is a perfectly unlucky guy. First, he robbed and killed the special envoy of the king in a daze, and let himself fall from the aloof head of the Holy See Flying Dragoons to the mortal world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after taking a breath, he disguised himself as a wandering businessman and investigated the Blood Moon Horn again, but it turned out to be a bad start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the accident was indeed smaller, but the consequences were similar. They also faced the pursuit of the aristocratic group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is only that the enemies in the previous wave were too high-end, and they were at the level of Wang Bo when they came up. Karlis pitted all his teammates to death. But this wave of enemies is not so strong, and teammates who have been blamed can still be alive and kicking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Holy Master. I am not a fool, my whereabouts have been exposed, and I will continue to stay in the southeast province, just waiting for the enemy to find me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reaction of these nobles, they still haven't let down their vigilance, and the time to track down the blood moon horn is not yet ripe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why don't we let our people evacuate the Alpha Kingdom first, and redevelop in another place. After three or five years, send someone over to investigate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Karliss suggested sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Easy to get on board, but difficult to get off. Although the Skull and Bones Society has been reorganized, some habits left by the cult organization have been inherited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: means of controlling people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the boat is in the middle of the big river. The turbulent river water and the tumbling waves are enough to make anyone daunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not wanting to jump off the boat to feed the fish, Carliss could only suggest to the captain to dock the boat first to avoid the turbulent waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Things are not as simple as you imagined. If we want to change the current situation, we must find the Horn of the Blood Moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this thing as a vote, the nobles would not believe that we betrayed the Holy See, let alone gain their support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a veteran cult organization controlled by the Holy See, the Skull and Bones Society has been running around and committing crimes in various countries in the mainland, and its reputation has long been stink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you leave the Alpha Kingdom, you will still be wanted and hunted down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our situation will not be any different from what it is now. We can still only hide from XZ and live a life of darkness. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man explained patiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one likes to hide from XZ all the time. He would have already run away if he could run away, even incognito, which is not unacceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the class in this world is too solidified. Even if they remain anonymous, they can only struggle at the bottom of society and continue to live a precarious life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for pretending to be a nobleman, if you think about it with your brain, you will know that it is unreliable. Any nobleman has his own background, it's okay to impersonate temporarily, but after a long time, it will definitely be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the words and deeds of nobles are not so easy to imitate. Without professional training, even the most basic aristocratic etiquette is unclear, let alone adapt to the thinking mode of the aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the nobles at the bottom, and the nobles who are further up can come into contact with the extraordinary power of magic. No matter how good the disguise technique is, it is not worth mentioning in front of extraordinary power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Beda City, Earl Pierce, who was thinking about how to deal with the next situation in the kingdom, was about to explode after receiving a letter from Viscount Oran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skull and Bones clearly regarded him as a soft persimmon. After planning a rebellion, they dared to show up in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order will be passed on to order nobles from all over the country to block major and large traffic arteries, and strictly investigate all business travelers entering and leaving Arbor County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Order Baron Raphael to take the Second Infantry Regiment to Arbor County for a walk. Be sure to catch all the members of the Skull and Bones hiding in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, all the griffin cavalry will be dispatched to conduct irregular patrols over various areas in the southeastern province, and report any changes immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the Skeleton Society rebelled, he was severely humiliated, and Pierce would never allow it to happen again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the outside world would think that the Dalton family had fallen and was unable to control the situation in the province, provoking a group of wolves to rush over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ruthless Governor Pierce is undoubtedly terrible. The entire southeastern province was mobilized, especially the nobles in Qiaomu County and its surrounding areas, which were mobilized to the maximum extent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this moment on, whoever does not have hundreds of private soldiers in their hands will not be able to sleep peacefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous area, Hudson's business suddenly improved. Originally, his customer base was concentrated in Wright and Wyton counties, but this time it directly spread to most of the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles who originally despised the quality of his weapons finally obediently placed an order. In order to increase the production of weapons, the original daily necessities orders are now forced to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fourteen or fifteen-year-old boys all went to the smelting field to work as apprentices. Some strong women also swung a sledgehammer, and even the process of land reclamation was affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't do anything, and the new orders are rushed one by one. The most important thing is that in order to get the goods quickly, these guys resorted to the legendary method of increasing money that is invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not just simply adding money, these guys also promised: they can use serfs, livestock, and grain to offset all the payment for the goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All hit Hudson's soft interior, and he had to find a way if he had no choice. In the face of urgent orders, you can only roll up your sleeves and do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm, the mine has changed from three meals to four meals, and the inferior bread has been upgraded to ordinary bread. The original material rationing and supply system has now also been upgraded to full control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order for everyone to maintain sufficient physical strength, three sheep are now slaughtered every day, and wild game is added from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks good, but in fact, this little supply of meat can only give ordinary workers a little bit of meat. It's not a master chef, you can't see the meat at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, thousands of people work in the mines. The daily meat supply of hundreds of pounds is really insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the premise that new animals will soon be accounted for, otherwise Hudson would not dare to be so extravagant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who makes the breeding business a long-term investment? Under the most primitive breeding method, it is difficult to see great results without a few years of hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without large-scale artificial breeding, just hunting the little meat, it is difficult to supply the daily quota of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for occasional customers who brought animals over to offset the purchase price, Hudson's sheepfold would have been empty long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the busy production line, Hudson felt a sense of accomplishment, as if his life was about to reach its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, you want me to be in charge of delivery?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson stood up from his seat, as if he had heard a big joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have sold so many products, and the customers have always come to pick up the goods, and it is purely overthinking to deliver the goods to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The monopoly merchant said: their own products do not include postage!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buy it if you like it, if you don't buy it, you will be discouraged. Baron Hudson, who couldn't make the order, is so confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Baron, I heard that you have promised that you will bear all the transportation costs incurred by exchanging serfs for your family's goods.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The visitor explained calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the nobles will take root. The trustworthy Baron Hudson will naturally not deny his promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's right, I have made this promise. You sent people to transport it, and I will reimburse you for the food and grass consumed on the way.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be generous and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles do not have the habit of calculating labor costs. The so-called transportation costs are food expenses for people and animals. Hudson really doesn't care about such a small expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if you want him to deliver the goods to your door, it will be different. Who doesn't know that there are skeletons haunting Qiaomu County now, maybe everyone will bump into them halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the fight starts, the cost will skyrocket. It is one thing to suffer heavy casualties, and if it is not done well, the entire army may be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nerve-wracking business has exceeded Hudson's risk tolerance, and this kind of business can't be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Baron, in normal times, we wouldn't dare to bother you to go there in person, but the current situation is special.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without your reputation and deterrence, it would be difficult for us to safely transport these weapons back to the territory, and the transaction would be out of the question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But don't worry, we know the rules. For the increased cost, we will settle according to the market price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our Lord Viscount promises that as long as you organize people to deliver all the orders of the nobles in Arbor County, he can guarantee that the number of serfs in this transaction will not be less than 1,500, the number of cattle will not be less than 300, and the number of rough horses will not be less than 1,000. six hundred horses...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can offset the difference with daily necessities. Considering that there are too many nobles participating in the transaction, you will need to talk to them yourself about what goods to offset. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the old butler said, Hudson's anger disappeared instantly. There is no business that cannot be negotiated in this world. As long as the benefits outweigh the risks, then everything is negotiable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A viscount's promise, Hudson still believed. Although the number is a bit large, there are not fifty nobles in Arbor County who have placed orders like this, but there are also thirty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's share it among everyone, whether it's 1,500 serfs, 300 cows, 800 rough horses... it's not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this big business, organizing a transport team to take the risk, Hudson thought it was still possible to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it the Skull and Bones gang that slipped through the net? As long as the interests are given enough, the heroic Baron Hudson is never afraid of these shady rats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I have accepted so many physical offsets at once, so I don't want to see gold coins in this business. If the products used to counteract are not attractive, he may have to pay a lot of money for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Steward Miklos, please tell the honorable Viscount Oran. If there is no accident, I will deliver this batch of supplies on time within half a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show sincerity, fifty pairs of plate armor can be added to this batch of materials as a gift to show the enduring friendship between our two families. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transaction between nobles is that simple. Viscount Oran helped him solve the problem of lack of population and livestock, and Hudson naturally had to give something in return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plate armor is already the product with the most technical content among all the commodities that can be produced in the territory. As an iron lump, the quality requirements for iron are not too high, so the quality has finally caught up to the average level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you get them on the market, at least they start with hardware coins, and they are the kind that are in short supply. Now they are directly taken out by Hudson as gifts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is worthwhile. After completing this business, the market in Arbor County will open in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for his own heavy infantry formation plan, the progress has been delayed again, Hudson said it doesn't matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made the grudge cultivation speed of those elm heads too slow?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing for a few hours, only more than 30 people got started. It's just a sense of breath, no different from ordinary people. Counting on them wearing armor to kill the Quartet, I don't know what year and month it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the experience taught by Baron Redman, to cultivate a qualified elite private army, it takes at least two or three years for serfs to practice fighting spirit, and then go through several wars before they can be formed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, this kind of soldiers who have practiced grudges are much stronger in individual combat than ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, combat qi cultivation requires talent, and without resource assistance, it is at a snail's pace, and it is difficult to popularize it on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few special military units that are composed of practitioners, the common troops in the outside world are composed of ordinary people. For example: the army brought over by the noble children of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the ordinary army, it is considered elite, but most of the soldiers in it are composed of ordinary people, with only a small number of practitioners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including heavy armored infantry, it is only composed of soldiers who are stronger than ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the fighting power of individual soldiers is not as good as that of cultivators, but because they have undergone systematic training and participated in many wars, they are not weaker than private troops trained by local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specifics still depend on the number of people fighting. The larger the scale of the war, the more conducive it is for these troops to play. If it is a small-scale conflict, the private army composed of practitioners is even better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality route cannot be taken, and Hudson can only take the quantity route. However, this requires a sufficient population base. Only when the population is large enough can enough high-quality soldiers be selected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army in Hudson's hands now is not all suitable for war, and they are left only because these people have experienced more than a dozen wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if most of the time, they just joined in the fun and didn't kill a few enemies at all, it still cultivated their spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of a series of trainings he conducted, now he can also see the shadow of the elite. If there was a fight, it might not be much worse than that gang of noble soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has also seen the nobles in northern Xinjiang training soldiers, but there is nothing new in fact, just training soldiers in combat skills such as chopping and stabbing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, it may not be as good as him, at least the soldiers trained by Hudson can run. Ten miles of long-distance running training every day does not guarantee that they will become the best soldiers, at least they can become the best runners among the infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And it is not a swarm of running around, but running in an organized and orderly manner. When making a strategic transfer, it is a proper top student.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Lord Baron, on behalf of Viscount Oran, I thank you for your generosity, and may the friendship between our two families last forever!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Miklos responded immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the familiar etiquette and reaction speed, it can be seen that this must be an old player.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wasn't limited by his status, this person would definitely do well in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The butlers of a mid-level noble family have this kind of self-cultivation and adaptability, which gave Hudson a better understanding of the aristocratic heritage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the gap between the big nobles, the middle nobles, and the small nobles is not just pure strength, but also the gap in talent accumulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in strength may be made up in a short period of time, but the gap in talent cannot be resolved overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the little nobles don't work hard, it's that their own plate is limited, and they are simply unable to cultivate high-level talents, let alone provide them with a stage to display their talents.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how lucrative the income is, Hudson dare not leave the lair with the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, the necessary precautions must be prepared. Obviously no one dares to do it, but it doesn't mean that no one will destroy it secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the main force still has to stay in the old nest in order to deter the villains. In the event of an emergency, an effective counterattack can also be organized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the use of mercenaries is inevitable. Nominally, the freight is borne by the other party, but in actual operation, it is a package price, such as a certain percentage increase in commodity prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specifics have to be determined according to the actual situation. The shipping fee for fighting with the skull and not fighting must not be a standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In these aspects, nobles are usually more particular. Hudson does all the business, everyone just talks about it, and the details are all based on self-consciousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has never been any trouble, and even the most stingy nobles rarely play tricks in these areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this has something to do with Hudson, who is too strong on Party B. Monopoly sellers can always gain more voice in transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson restrained his inner greed and did not take the opportunity to exploit severely, which is also the reason why these transactions can go smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you meet someone with friendship, you will inevitably give a preferential price. In terms of maintaining personal connections, Hudson also spent a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to deliver these letters separately. By the way, make an appointment with Baron Kettley, and we will go hunting in the mountains together tomorrow!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transportation brigade Hudson is only going to send out a hundred elites, and the rest will hire nobles and private troops. It's nothing more than a matter of money, and not all knights are as expensive as his \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, sir!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Collar, Baron Kettley, who is a good neighbor, couldn't help exclaiming after receiving the invitation:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you kidding, your master, invite me to go hunting tomorrow?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not surprising that the nobles hunt together, but that is all reserved in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Departure tomorrow, only notified this evening, this kind of temporary invitation cannot be said to exist, but it will only happen between nobles with good relationships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship is not in place, it will be embarrassing if someone rejects the invitation after saying that there is no time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the interactions between myself and Hudson, there is no one that is comfortable, let alone friendship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of misunderstanding can make the other party think that everyone has a good relationship?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley was very puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, honorable Baron Kettley. My master said that you will definitely attend, otherwise you will definitely regret it in the future.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The messenger's original report made Baron Kettley even more confused. Isn't it just a hunt, if you don't participate, you will regret it, as if something really happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was confirmed that the soldier who delivered the letter knew nothing, and Kettley didn't bother to waste time on him, so he sent him away directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, you said Hudson's profiteer, what kind of bad idea is this time. You can't invite me to hunt together tomorrow, just to show off his superb archery skills?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he has no affection for Baron Hudson Kettley at all. A hero will only cherish a hero, no one will cherish a profiteer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being cheated continuously, now he even dislikes the mountain leader, let alone Hudson, the instigator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is not certain, maybe he is simply showing off his archery skills. In fact, these are not important. It is not a small gain to be able to get in close contact with each other and feel the strength of the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this Baron Hudson has other plans, but sending someone over to invite him in a fair and honest way can't be against you, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no grievances or enmities, even if there is a little festival, it is our loss, and he has no reason to deal with you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles have their own rules of the game. Even the cruelest nobles would not do such super stupid things as inviting people to their homes to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that everyone is not an enemy, even if it is really a life-and-death relationship, it is not like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, your master invited me to Arbor County?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My poor cousin must have lost his mind. Knowing that there will be skeletons haunting him, he still dares to go to Arbor County at this time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you talking about, take twenty guards, go back and forth for fifteen days/one hundred gold coins, the employer is responsible for the expenses along the way, and the cost of fighting will be calculated separately, and the loss will be borne by the employer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait, I think you can still think about it. If there are many participants, you can actually take a risk. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's definitely not that Adrian Knight has shallow eyelids, it's because the other party has given too much. It is absolutely impossible for the normal employment market price to be so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just look at bringing twenty elite guards, only one hundred silver coins per day. This kind of employment price is only slightly higher, but the problem is that the battle costs are calculated separately, and all losses are borne by the employer. (1 gold coin = 15 silver coins)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mercenary charges are high because they are exchanging their lives for money, and all the deaths and injuries are borne by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other conscientious employer like Hudson who guarantees compensation for losses in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this also reflects from the side that the risk of this operation will not be too high, at least it will not cause a large number of casualties, otherwise the shrewd cousin of his family could not promise to guarantee the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, dear Adrian Knight. The content of the letter is my master's promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides you, there are more than a dozen noble lords who received the invitation at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our master will personally lead the army to participate in the escort, and guarantee that there will be no less than ten knights participating in this operation, so the safety issue you are worried about is not a problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the confident orderly, Adrian strengthened his judgment even more. Most likely someone who took advantage of him paid for his cousin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skull and Bones Society is indeed powerful, but it is only a group of remnants, and the number of them must not be too large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than a dozen knights + hundreds of elite soldiers to escort, enough to deal with various emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this world is a world of nobles. Once a fight breaks out, it will soon attract the attention of the surrounding nobles and lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the battle is not one-sided, reinforcements will arrive on the battlefield soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the masters of the Skull and Bones are, they won't be able to kill them as soon as they come up, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is so awesome, the outcome of the last war was reversed, so why hide XZ everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't meet the enemy, then earn some hard money to fill your dry pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter an enemy and then leave the enemy behind, it will be blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only can earn money from the employer, but also a reward from the Governor's Palace. If one of the important figures is killed, one can also record a military merit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no new territory to divide for the time being, no one will have too much military merit. Even if they entered the kingdom's army to serve, those with military merits would be assigned a higher position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter in ordinary times, but in wartime, the level of military rank will directly affect the survival rate on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell Hudson, I have accepted this deal. If there is such a good business in the future, let him continue to take care of me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian Knight replied carelessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike Hudson who is also worried about being stolen, he has no worries at all. The few unlucky **** who sneaked into his master Adrian's territory in front of him are still busy licking their wounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's make another wave, that is when Earl Pierce is dead. The result of the governor's personal ruling, which has been overturned in less than two months, is a provocation to the governor's majesty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of stubbornness does not exist in the southeast province. Even if some nobles dared to fight against the governor, it was within the scope of the rules and against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you violate the rules and provoke the majesty of the governor, you must feel the power of the kingdom's iron fist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar scene was also staged in many territories. Although not as exaggerated as Adrian Knight's performance, he was still defeated by the gold coins overall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe everyone is not as domineering as Adrian Knight, who directly taught the neighbors a profound lesson, but there are not many people like Hudson who are afraid of being robbed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple, the people invited are all poor ghost knights. The most important wealth in the territory is the serfs, but no one dares to touch these things now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land is placed there, but it cannot be moved away. Goods such as livestock and agricultural tools can also be stored in the neighbor's house before they leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it was a cult attack, no nobleman would take a liking to this impoverished territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really encounter a cult attack, you should run faster. Because the presence or absence of them will not affect the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not at home, you can avoid the obligation to keep the land. Afterwards, you can ask your employer to help suppress it. After all, the aristocracy is a society of human feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, Hudson is hiring guards. Another way of thinking is this is not a favor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just half a month, after running such a round trip, the money for farm tools and daily necessities was all earned back. This kind of good work is rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a certain friendship, there is no turn at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the sunny Salam Mountains, only a few sounds of \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\" were heard, and a bunch of wild geese in the sky fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that the arrows came from 300 meters away. Obviously, only five arrows flew out but thirteen geese fell. The most amazing thing is that these arrows are all pierced through the heads of wild geese. passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How this unreasonable scene was achieved, no one knows, anyway, the facts are in front of us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you are really good at archery! Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, I am afraid that you will not be able to find anyone who can match your Excellency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the entire human race, few people can reach your level. Perhaps only some sharpshooters in the elves can compete with you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't Baron Kettler's flattery, the scene in front of him really stunned him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laymen watch the excitement, while experts watch the doorway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like he hasn't seen a sharpshooter before on the battlefield in northern Xinjiang, but he has never heard of Hudson's unreasonable archery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that from the beginning to the end of the bow, Hudson did not have any preparations, and did it completely casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the hit rate is sky-high, but the most incredible thing is that the five arrows are fired in succession without waiting for a pause, as if there is no need to aim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an existence, once it appears on the battlefield, it will be a massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the range of the arrow, Kettley clearly felt that more than 300 meters was not the limit. Arrows can only fly so far, and it's only this far to be completely prey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such precise strength control should not appear in humans at all. Even the elves who are the best at shooting, few people can do this step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a bit of common sense knows that the prowess of an archer is usually directly proportional to his own strength, and the archers of the army are often composed of the strongest soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley has also seen the Elven Bow in Hudson's hand in the Northlands before. Without the strength of the great knight, he would not be able to pull it. If you want to retract freely, the requirements for strength are even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson has never been full, Baron Kettley does not think he is full. Hudson's calmness and composure during the shooting alone had infinitely elevated his status in Baron Kettley's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no explanation, it was just for pretense. Naturally, the more bluffing the better, as to whether it will scare the audience, it doesn't matter about him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, you're amazing. There are hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the continent of Aslante, and the legendary Arrow Saint shoots out a giant dragon with one arrow. With my meager skills, I can only rule the roost in a small place like the Southeast Province.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said unceremoniously, without any shame of cheating, as if he really had this strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with legendary characters to pretend to be aggressive, but Baron Kettley didn't feel that it was inconsistent at all. Judging from the strength Hudson is showing now, it may not be a new legend. ,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the birth of a legend should have been a happy event, but as a good neighbor, Baron Kettley was not at all happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, it is inevitable to be associated with legendary characters and become a foil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Baron Kettley was concerned about his abilities, he was still shaken at this moment. Small Wright County can't accommodate two dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sith Baron had put enough pressure on him, but now this strong neighbor who should be able to open up wasteland and farm with peace of mind showed his fangs again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you invited me here today, isn't it really for hunting?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extending the head is a slash, and shrinking the head is also a slash. Simply ask directly, I am too lazy to waste time here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Baron Kettley, you're still so quick to talk. To tell you the truth, I really have something to discuss when I invite you here today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, I am going to take a long trip, which may be as short as 15 days or as long as a month. During this period, it is inevitable that some Xiao Xiaoxiao will come over to do things if they are overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain territory is remote, surrounded by mountains on three sides and plains on the other. Maple Leaf is the only way suitable for the army to march, so please ask the neighbors to take care of them, and don't let all the messy people in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As good neighbors, we have shared hardships together. Baron Kettley would not refuse this small favor, would he? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's shameless request, Baron Kettley almost fainted from anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is this the attitude of asking for help?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    is clearly a naked threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was so unlucky to be the co-author, just stuck outside the gate of the Mountain Territory, so he had to act as a goalkeeper for free?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Baron Kettley didn't dare to refuse. The phrase \"together we suffer together\" is too lethal, and Hudson obviously relied on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just tell him directly that if something happens to the mountain leader, the Maple Leaf leader will also have to accompany him in bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fear of the strength of the person in front of him, Baron Kettley would have wished to hack this shameless person to death on the spot, but unfortunately he is not an impulsive person after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are you determined to eat me?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said through gritted teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he was really angry this time, and started calling people by their names, even omitting the word baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm sorry, Lord Ketterley. Actually, I don't want that either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the enemy hidden in the dark is really hard to guard against before showing up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Maple Leaf leader is in front of him, as long as he is dealt with, the enemy will not be able to get through. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a face full of shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deep apology is beyond words, but it is a pity that the decision is not changed. Whether Lord Kettley wanted to or not, he would be forced to act as goalkeeper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. For the safety of the territory, Hudson can only be shameless once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Lord Kettley doesn't let the enemy in, there won't be any other mountain trails. It is not an ordinary difficulty to go around from the vast Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accidentally get lost halfway, it is estimated that Hudson will return from Arbor County, and the enemy may not be able to touch the gate of the mining area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, if you're so bullying, aren't you afraid that I'll be caught in the dark?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If eyes could kill, Hudson would have been hacked to pieces, skinned and cramped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency will not do this. Even if the mountain territory is attacked, I will suffer heavy losses at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much damage can be done, it is nothing more than losing some money and food, so no one dares to slaughter all the serfs in the territory, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With my name, some people are willing to give me help. Coupled with the support of the family, it will take at most one or two years to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But your Excellency is different. If you fail once, you will lose everything. Even if your family is willing to continue to provide support, it will not be able to quench the near thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the three hundred elites in your hands, not only will you have no place to stand in Wright County, but it is also unknown whether you will be able to return to the Northland alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, after your Excellency entered Wright County, the offenders were not one or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they didn't dare to do anything when Your Excellency was strong, but these people definitely don't lack the courage to throw stones at you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He fixed his eyes on Baron Kettley, as if waiting for the final answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He knew that the more it was like this, the more he couldn't back down. Any concession will make the other party suspicious.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

People finally gritted their teeth and agreed. If you stimulate them again, it may really drive people crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is reckoned that the geese hunting that was just a coincidence just now fell into the eyes of Baron Kettley, and it was his deliberate \"intimidation\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conscience of heaven and earth \"five arrows and thirteen geese, the arrows pass through the head\", can this be shot by normal people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson cheats, it must be the cooperation of the geese. If it weren't for the fact that the geese were changing their formation and were caught up by the arrows, such a miracle would not have happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson pretended to be too successful, and directly confused Baron Kettley, without thinking about coincidence at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only shooting five arrows is not just for pretending; more importantly, to achieve such a range, Hudson can only shoot five arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are more, the arm strength will be unbearable. Who made him just a rookie who just touched the threshold of an intermediate knight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary bow and arrow shooting can easily shoot more than a hundred arrows; the high-strength elf strong bow cannot be fully drawn under normal circumstances, so it will naturally be limited in use.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the shooting range is lowered and the output of arm strength is reduced, the continuous output ability of this strong archer will be really impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's transportation brigade has not yet been formed. The second infantry regiment that entered Arbor County has already completed two rounds of dragnet searches with local nobles, and they almost turned the land over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After half a month of tossing and turning, there was no sign of Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the evidence of the corpses of the Florian knight and fifty-seven soldiers, plus the testimony of a group of witnesses, everyone would doubt whether the news of the skeleton's appearance was a rumor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one could be found for a long time. Not only did everyone not relax, but they became more nervous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cult organization is scary because it hides in the dark. If it really exposes its identity, it will be easier to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, almost a month has passed since the day I started posting, and I still have nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps the members of Skull and Bones have left Arbor County.

According to past practice, they will flee thousands of miles after committing a crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they failed to capture the Skeleton Lord this time, everyone was not without gains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We successfully smashed the dens of the Cult of the Evil God, the Cult of Chaos God, the Church of Desire, etc. We also smashed three private salt gangs and arrested a total of 236 criminals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I believe that after this battle, the social order in Arbor County will be...\" Hearing Baron Raphael's conclusion of the battle, Viscount Oran's face was gloomy and terrifying. Most of these criminals were picked out of Arbor City, so he almost said He, the city lord, is not good at governing the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the facts are in front of him, and he can't find a reason to refute. The Baron Raphael in front of him was sent by the Governor's Mansion to help, so there is no need to buy him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Raphael is right. During this period of time, everyone has achieved a lot of victories. But these are a group of small fish, which have nothing to do with our goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to have a long-term peace and stability, everyone has to continue to work harder to wipe out the skeleton gang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This cult organization has set off five rebellions since it entered our Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous few times are still far away from us, so we can ignore them for the time being, but everyone has experienced the rebellion in Wright and Wyton counties last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that they would flee thousands of miles away immediately after failure as usual, but now they reappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Does this mean that they have new plans in Arbor County or the southeastern province?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, if this cancerous tumor is not removed, my southeastern province will have trouble sleeping and eating! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to stop the hunt. Who knows if the Skull and Bones members will make a comeback after everyone disbands the team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Riding the risk of revealing your identity, you can't act just to kill the Florian knight, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knight, where did he get this card?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred of killing the father, the hatred of taking the wife, or the Florian knight dug the ancestral grave of the Skull and Bones Lord?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't look like it no matter what!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dead Florian knight didn't say how decent he was, at least he wasn't a vicious person, and he had a good reputation in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Oran, the Governor-General has ordered martial law throughout the province, and strictly inspected all traffic arteries and docks. Once the Skull and Bones members show up, they will be found immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the roads entering and exiting Arbor County are the focus of supervision. If the people of Skull and Bones were smart enough, they wouldn't show up at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they have already entered the province of Faerun in the north, or Fengyun province in the west, which is beyond our jurisdiction and can only be dealt with by the governor's office. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Raphael analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the local nobles in Arbor County, who can spend so much time here, the Second Infantry Regiment still has its own tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to come over to help out occasionally, but if you stay in Qiaomu County for a long time, what about the port?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long time of transfer, wouldn't it be embarrassing if the boss found out that the port can operate normally without them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slogan of preventing the invasion of the Sea Clan has been chanted for countless years. Unfortunately, the port where the Second Infantry Regiment has been stationed has been stationed for hundreds of years, and there has been no trace of the Sea Clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the invasion of the sea clan, since the birth of the Alpha Kingdom, there has never been a sea clan invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coastal defense line, which was once heavily populated, has long been deserted, and the only remaining task is to fight against pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that is also the task of the sailors. They, a group of landlubbers, usually maintain the order of the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is nothing to maintain. The port where the Second Infantry Regiment was stationed was the fiefdom of the Dalton family, and they had the ability to administer it themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are dispatched to handle the affairs of Arbor County. Apart from being the closest, the most important thing is that they are the most free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of nobles in the province have long called for the abolition of the Second Infantry Regiment. After all, no one wants to apportion military expenses and keep a useless army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the kingdom's coastal defense forces, they have already been transferred to the northern front line one after another. The task of defending the Sea Clan was directly delegated to the major provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the enemy's coastal defense, it is natural that there is no defense in the sea. It is said that in the depths of the ocean now, various ethnic groups are holding friendly PK matches, and the battle is more intense than that on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for a result, the probability of landing is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everyone is not a species of the same dimension, and the marine race that has landed can easily become a delicacy on the human table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bayda City, after receiving the message from his subordinates, Earl Pierce spat out two words indifferently. \"big eater!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding no trace of the Skull and Bones is the second thing. At least catch a few worthy guys to make up for it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making such a big fuss, he caught a bunch of rotten fish and rotten shrimps. How can he, the governor, end well?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It really doesn't work. It is acceptable to catch the private salt dealers and dig deep to dig out the salt gangs behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't know that the salt trade in the southeastern province is his Dalton family property?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to sell private salt, it is clear that he does not take him, the \"king of the southeast\", seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the private salt trade can proceed smoothly, and there must be the support of the local nobles behind this, at least the acquiescence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who makes the benefits of salt too great?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tens of thousands of kitchen households along the coast will create a lot of profits for the Dalton family every year, and the stable salt profits are monopoly trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, there was no such thing as private salt in the Alpha Kingdom at first, and the kingdom's decree did not stipulate who could only sell the salt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the rise of the great aristocracy, they gradually monopolized the kingdom's salt trade. Everyone reached an agreement with the kingdom to hand in a certain amount of financial resources every year in exchange for the salt franchise in a certain place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are just unspoken rules, and have not fallen into legal documents. Basically, whoever has the biggest fist will make the deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the big family falls into decline, these interests will also be transferred. Whether you can keep this interest depends entirely on your own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too late now, the master who dares to sell private salt does not have to be strong, but he must have a good nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the basic operation to immediately run away from the perceived danger. If they walk a step slower, the nobles who originally supported them secretly will often be the first to raise their butcher knives at them at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the Second Infantry Regiment continue to hunt down the Skull and Bones. If they can't catch anyone, they won't come back.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not just venting anger, but more politically, he needs to make a gesture. The news of the Skull and Bones' appearance in Arbor County has spread, and the request for help has entered the Governor's Mansion early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Governor's Mansion does nothing, then there will be changes in the local area, or the old events of Wright and Wyton Counties will repeat, and Earl Pierce will not be able to handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom cannot tolerate an incompetent governor, and the nobles in the southeastern provinces cannot tolerate an irresponsible governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Dalton family is powerful, it does not mean that the governor cannot be replaced. If we really want to get to that point, there is a high probability that our family will be the first to ask for a substitution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because I took the initiative, I was able to win the position of the successor governor. It is better to have the meat rotten in my own pot than to send someone from the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, after more than 20 days of overtime work, and other orders that have not yet been delivered, Hudson finally got the goods together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The messy things added together, fully filled forty carriages. In addition to weapons and equipment, there are also a lot of pots and pans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, I didn't bring much food. Except for the necessary dry food, the rest was walking and eating all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson is very relieved. With his title of \"Knight of the Bow\", he will not worry about not being able to buy food on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have a thicker skin and eat free food all the way, you can transport the goods there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson's lineup, Adrian Knight was shocked and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you only take a hundred soldiers on the road?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expressions on everyone's faces were not very good-looking. Everyone dared to take orders at this time, relying on the elite in Hudson's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to say that Hudson is a chicken thief. The knights invited to **** are not only poor, but also have no comrades in the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has only heard about his brilliant record, but they don't know how much water is in it. So much so that everyone's confidence in him is a hundred times stronger than himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't you still have you? Forty truckloads of goods are more than enough to dispatch four hundred people.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only for transporting goods, this configuration must be a high configuration. On average, ten people and one car can push them all the way to Arbor County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now that there are traces of the Skull and Bones Society, everyone's confidence is not so high. In particular, it was said that it was a golden knight who killed the Florian knight, which made everyone even more uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are high-ranking knights, priests of evil gods, and various evil summoning spells. Once you fight, you will know the tragic scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Hudson, I beg you not to make such jokes, and take your main force on the road together!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he couldn't help complaining secretly: Everyone is his own, and he doesn't bring such cheating brothers. In case of an accident, wouldn't it be a human tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give everyone a reassuring look, Hudson smiled lightly and said: \"You worry too much! Things are not as bad as you imagined, as long as our luck is not too bad, the journey should be smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones did make an appearance in Arbor County, but that was a month ago. The Governor's Mansion has sent an infantry regiment to assist the local nobles and capture the remnants of the Skull and Bones Society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how low their efficiency was, they cleaned up Arbor County. It is unknown whether the group of mice who have been hiding in dark corners all day are still alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles along the way have also stepped up their vigilance, and there are checkpoints on all the main roads, waiting for the Skull and Bones to come to their door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the convoy forward, we will not take shortcuts or take small paths, and we are all our own people along the way, so what is there to be afraid of?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Skeleton Lord really came, he would avoid us. Is it possible that the remaining three or five members of their sect can still rob our convoy? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to say, but in fact Hudson is also betting that the skeleton will look down on his team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although weapons and equipment are good, they must be used by someone. The current Skull and Bones, the most important thing is to hide, even if they grab the convoy, they can't go on the road with such a big goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Acting rashly will only increase the probability of their exposure and attract more hunting troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who couldn't find enough reasons to refute were barely persuaded by Hudson. It's already here, you can't just go back home just because you are afraid of the risk, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is not something a knight should do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, everyone needs the money, so there is no reason to quit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that people's hearts are barely available, Hudson didn't bother to continue talking nonsense, and announced his departure with a big wave of his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending charcoal in a timely manner is more valuable than icing on the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the fact that the nobles in Arbor County have not yet recovered from their fear of the Skull and Bones, they send the goods there first, which can gain a lot of favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Later, the risk has been completely passed, and it is just a single business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The convoy moved forward slowly, and the biting cold wind hit everyone's faces, telling the arrival of winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winter in the southern country is attacked by magic. It is really not a good choice to rush in this season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the accompanying people were all the elites of various families, and they were not treated harshly. It is tightly wrapped from top to bottom to be able to withstand the biting cold wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    60 miles a day, this speed is slower than Hudson expected. The main reason is that the roads along the way are too bad, which delays the speed of the convoy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the benefits of extensive communication are reflected. Send someone to inform in advance, and the nobles along the way will prepare the preparations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hot water, hot meals, hot dishes...everything is available, basically walking, eating and living all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about friendship, so naturally you can't talk about money. But the sensible Hudson prepared many generous gifts early on. Basically, it is to go all the way and send it all the way. In short, it will not make the owner suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in a hurry, I had to decline the welcome banquet held by the nobles along the way, and missed the opportunity to further exchange feelings and expand the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of thing should not be rushed for a while. If you want to make friends, you can always find opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The proper arrangement made all the knights who were a little apprehensive completely let go of their suspense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are their own people everywhere, and it is unreasonable to be afraid of the remnants of Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soft power is also strength, and the connections shown along the way changed the way all the knights looked at Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the famous \"Knight of the Bow\" is not only able to fight, has many relatives, but also has friends everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct influence is Cavaliers Coelho, Cavaliers Roman, and Cavaliers Valov. The three good neighbors privately expressed their willingness to attach themselves to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were signs of this before, it was only a prototype and did not break the window paper. What they saw along the way undoubtedly made them make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other knights also showed signs of moving closer, but because of their geographical location, they failed to make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weaker the strength, the more need to form a group. Before taking over the transportation business, Hudson hadn't felt the need for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I am a local tyrant, and the strength of the neighbors around me is also very average. It would be good if he didn't bully others, and he didn't worry about threats from foreign enemies at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the development of the transportation business, Hudson suddenly found that his lair was not so safe, otherwise he would not have pulled down his face and threatened Baron Kettley to help guard the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this kind of thing can be changed one by one, and it must not be repeated again and again. After a long time of oppression, there will be a day when there will be a backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unrealistic to greatly increase the strength of the territory in a short period of time, and Hudson has no choice but to turn his attention to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more friends, the road will be easier; with more allies, the fight will be tough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that forming an alliance is a matter that requires all-round consideration. While enjoying the benefits brought by the alliance, you must also assume corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing can't be rushed, and we must continue to screen in order to choose the most suitable allies for grouping.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The mountain baron's team passed by here just now. It is said that they are going to transport weapons to Arbor County. It seems to be used to fight against the Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The convoy was too heavily guarded, and no strangers were allowed to approach it. Even during meal times, there were guards in rotation. It was not possible to investigate exactly what weapons were transported. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young man said to himself, not noticing that the old man frowned slightly when he heard the word \"Skull and Bones\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I see, Shire. Since it is the business of the nobles, then this matter is over, and there is no need to continue to pay attention.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the person who was going to investigate before was not him. Charles has long been familiar with this scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My master is a bit eccentric, but he is a very nice person. Not only did they take in these orphans, but also taught them all skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of travelling, most of the money earned has been spent on them. How can we not let them be grateful?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dismissing Charles, the old man's expression suddenly became solemn, as if he was engaged in a fierce inner struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, I'm back.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A crisp voice sounded, interrupting the old man's thoughts. But in front of the young girl in front of him, the old man never loses his temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, my elf. If you continue to shake like this, your grandpa will be tossed to pieces.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said kindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is anyone in this world who can move him, it must be the girl in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, you are lying again! I am so weak, how could I shake you to pieces?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl said with an unhappy face. She looks like an angry elf, but with two big rolling eyes, revealing her true inner thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guna, you are being naughty again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man stretched out his hand and pinched the girl's tender little face, his face was full of love and helplessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, are we moving again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna asked rather reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Somehow, her grandpa always likes to move. In name, the business was not easy to do, so she started again in another place, but the girl knew that her grandpa was just moving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On other issues, her grandfather is willing to follow her, but he is very firm on the issue of moving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that she is only eleven or twelve years old, but the girl is also well-informed, and she has set foot in seven countries with the old man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During her growing years, nearly a third of her time was spent traveling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Business is not easy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the southeastern province was rich, and we could make a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't expect to find out after I came here that the property of nobles and lords is everywhere, and we traveling merchants can only make a living in the cracks. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lame excuse came from the old man again, and the girl rolled her eyes directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where in the entire continent of Asalanta is not the territory of the nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the so-called Holy See, the free federation that claims to be a commercial paradise, is also the world of the nobility, but with a different name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially a group of nobles without noble status, exercising the rights of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a foreign country, it also has the existence of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a coincidence, but caused by the nature of the world where the weak prey on the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the old man cannot be persuaded at all, Guna smiled slightly and said, \"Grandpa, do you know what I saw today?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bear, a silly and cute Earth Bear, it even winked at me with an extremely cute expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the bear has an unscrupulous owner. Actually want Little Bear to grow bigger and drag him on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I went up to argue with him, but he even threatened that if I was too nosy, I would be arrested and be his maid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Xiongxiong was smart, he became the size of a palm, jumped onto that guy's shoulder and couldn't get off...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young girl talked happily, but the old man's face gradually became gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guna, listen carefully. Don't get close to strangers, especially those unscrupulous nobles!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why, I think that guy is very interesting! He is so stupid to negotiate the price with Bear...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the girl finished speaking, the old man snapped: \"Listen to grandpa's advice to stay away from those guys, sometimes it feels like a lie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your telepathy, although able to detect the malice of most people, is not a panacea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you meet someone with a special bloodline, or someone who has reached a certain level of cultivation, your telepathy will fail!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you like the Earth Bear, grandpa will help you catch it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't go, it's dangerous! I don't want the Earth Bear.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna said hurriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Our little Gu Na has grown up, and knows to be worried about grandpa's safety. In the past, you asked grandpa for everything you fancy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said lovingly, as if he was happy for the growth of his granddaughter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, this time is different. I really sensed the danger, scarier than anyone I've seen before!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guna said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just coupled with her cute expression, it is really not convincing. However, the old man, who was familiar with the talent of his granddaughter, did not take it lightly, and asked uncertainly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Could it be that the Earth Bear has grown up?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of travelling, they have come into contact with many people and things, including some of the top powerhouses in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be described as scarier than anything by a girl, and the old man can only think of an adult Earth Bear. As for the accompanying escort, they were directly ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all out to hang out, who doesn't have a bunch of younger brothers? Although he is just a traveling businessman on the surface, secretly he is a well-known \"big boss\" in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that he is a sad boss, and he can't be as majestic as other big shots. Instead, he has to \"hide and hide\" all day long, for fear of revealing his true identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not staying in one place for a long time, in addition to being convenient for directing subordinates to do things, but also worrying about getting familiar with the local area and being noticed that something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if the old man is alone. Even if someone finds out his identity, he can still get away, but with an extra little granddaughter, it will be difficult to escape smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No! Little Xiongxiong's strength is a bit strange, it is almost catching up with your grandfather, but it is indeed just born, and it seems that it has not been weaned yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I saw it, the bear was holding a feeding bottle that was bigger than its body, it looked so cute...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the granddaughter who was gradually drifting away, the old man reminded helplessly: \"Guna, the question of whether the earth bear is cute or not, we will discuss it later. Now let me tell you something that makes you feel dangerous?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"He's not a thing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, it's a thing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't seem right either!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops, grandpa hates it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all your fault for interrupting me, everyone is stunned by you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl's nonsensical explanation made the old man dizzy and confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, that guy is a person. It's the bad guy called the Mountain Baron, and some people call him the Knight of the Bow, anyway, that annoying guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a mysterious power in him, which makes people feel very powerful, and I can't explain it clearly! Anyway, grandpa, you should stay away from him. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, the old man's heart sank. The original little thoughts were wiped out in a smooth manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many ways to do things to cover their departure, there is no need to choose the most dangerous one. While there may be good things in the team, it's still the little ones that matter more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skull and Bones Club didn't have much wealth in the first place, and the old man didn't want to lose all the capital he had painstakingly accumulated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Lord of Dawn, still waiting for him to spread glory. Precious manpower should not be wasted on insignificant people and things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unaware of an accidental contact, Hudson, who had escaped for himself, was still talking nonsense with the knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the weird little girl he met before, it was just a small episode in his life, and he was not interested in studying it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many similar unruly girls on the continent of Aslante, but in the previous life, there were a lot of them. Getting into trouble means getting into trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The things were delivered to Qiaomu County smoothly. Everyone was both happy and disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No twists and turns, personal safety is guaranteed, but it also means that the opportunity to make a fortune is missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't have time to pay attention to the complicated hearts of the hired knights, arrived in Hudson, Arbor County, and immediately got busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transactions between nobles are different from street vendors, and equal status is the basis of cooperation. This kind of thing can only be done by Hudson himself, and no one else can do it for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fixed one customer after another and finalized one business after another, Hudson is happy and painful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how busy you are, you still have to attend the banquet. As the host, Viscount Oran held a grand welcome banquet in the city, and it would be impossible not to show face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just that Hudson soon felt that something was wrong. It seemed that today's banquet was a little weird. He had just stepped into the banquet hall, and under the envious eyes of everyone, he was entangled by a group of noble ladies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one word difference between \"Peach Blossom Luck\" and \"Peach Blossom Tribulation\". Overheated love luck is love disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson experienced it personally. If he only won the favor of one or two noble ladies, he might still be able to spend a wonderful night. Now he can only experience the power of the Shura field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, in front of all the noble ladies, Hudson can only pretend to be a gentleman. I dare not show any evil thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After drinking a few glasses of wine and clearing his mind, Hudson quickly understood what was going on. The more troubled times are, the more favored the strong will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats of Arbor County had just experienced a thrilling experience, so they were naturally affected. In the aristocratic world, both men and women have their own ways of survival, and competition is everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-quality objects are rare species in any world. The most ideal marriage partner for noble ladies is always the heir to the title of each family, or the existence that has already inherited the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marrying these lords with titles and fiefdoms means that they will be guaranteed for the rest of their lives. Only when he loses in the competition with the same **** will he settle for the second son of a noble family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the famous \"Knight of the Bow\", the young Baron Hudson, who is still unmarried, has naturally become an existence that attracts bees and butterflies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All noble ladies in Arbor County who have some ideas, come here at this moment. I want to conquer Hudson with my own charm and become the last big winner in this competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Excessive Yan Fu, that is Yan \"kalpa\". Hudson felt this deeply, even if he thought some of them were good-looking, he had no chance to learn more about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the imaginary aristocratic romance, it is best to find a widowed lady to play with, otherwise it is easy to be hacked to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for these unmarried noble ladies, once they cross the threshold, there is a high probability that they will be entangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have enough status to support yourself to raise a mistress, then it's better to be quiet. Otherwise, tossing and ruining one's reputation will affect any future marriages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson still has high requirements for his significant other. They must be seductive enough, have enough brains, and have good conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for being in the same family, that is not a requirement at all. These aristocratic ladies in front of them can basically meet the requirements, and those who are not of sufficient status will not be able to integrate into this circle at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Oran is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who said it, and instantly attracted the attention of everyone on the field. The clever Hudson hurriedly took advantage of this rare opportunity to get rid of the entanglement of the group of noble ladies in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome everyone to come and participate in today's banquet. Let us raise our glasses and respect our most distinguished guest, Baron Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of Viscount Oran came, and Hudson, who had just mixed into the crowd, had to go to the front stage again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Viscount Oran, for your warm hospitality, and thank you all for coming to join us today...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of polite words spit out from Hudson's mouth for free. I don't care whether it is suitable for this place, it just sounds good anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobles, the place where you least need to be responsible for saying something wrong is at a banquet. As long as it is not deliberately provoking, causing trouble, and some language flaws, no one will go into it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, after drinking several times, there are many cases of gaffes. Some guys who don't have alcohol tend to make some shocking news when they get drunk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, as long as you don't involve yourself, everyone will just take it as a joke. Meddling in other people's business is not the style that a qualified nobleman should have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome Baron Hudson again, this is my daughter Melissa, a junior magician of the water department, who has just returned from the Royal Academy of Magic.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran introduced solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the shy girl in front of him, it was difficult for Hudson to associate her with the magician. On this occasion, such a formal introduction still made him think a little more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the old man in front of him wants to recruit himself as his son-in-law?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is not impossible. Although there is a huge gap between a viscount and a baron, Hudson is no ordinary baron!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle for the governor of Wright County has just begun. As a powerful faction among the local nobles in the southeastern province, Hudson is the seed player.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this nominal viscount is not as good as a real fiefdom viscount, it is enough as a marriage partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is only one heir to a real noble, but there can be many children of a noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many nobles at the level of a real viscount in the entire Alpha Kingdom. Rather than adding his daughter to the second son of a certain viscount's family, it is better to choose a powerful faction like Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the inherent advantages of native origin and the support of the Koslow family, if there is another strong in-law, Hudson still has a very high chance of winning in the next Wright County sheriff game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nice to meet you, Miss Melissa.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson greeted politely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what Viscount Oran thinks, knowing a beautiful noble lady will never hurt you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nice to meet you, Baron Hudson. I heard that you are still a magician. What kind of magic is it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from Melissa's eyes that she seems to be more interested in \"Magician Hudson\" than Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh, I can't talk about a magician. I only know a little bit about magic. Maybe I have shared the talent of the magic pet, so it is relatively smooth in the cultivation of earth magic.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of professionals, Hudson can't believe that he is self-taught. If it were really that easy to practice magic, magicians would already be dead on the streets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to give the opponent a chance to go deeper, Hudson decisively chose to let the Cubs take the blame. Anyway, it is all magic obtained through talent sharing, and it can be justified if you don't know some common sense about magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you are so lucky to be able to get an Earth Bear as a magic pet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wonder what method you used to recover it? If it is convenient, please advise one or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that my mentor, in order to obtain a magic pet, has gone deep into the Warcraft Mountains seven times, but so far he has found nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also a few pretentious seniors and senior sisters who sneaked into the Warcraft Mountains with guards last year, but they were all fed to the Warcraft!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the girl's constant complaints, Hudson suddenly found that the Viscount Oran was no longer there. The surrounding nobles also consciously gave up their space, leaving the two of them here alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is very sensible, and no one jumped out to disrupt the stage. It's just this kind of scene, Hudson is also panicked! As a single dog, who can tell him what to do at this moment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Should he continue to communicate magic with Melissa, or talk about magic pets? The problem is that his knowledge in these areas is all novice!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson also has a magic pet, Bear Stearns is obviously not a serious bear and is not representative at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he went to find a magic pet according to his routine of fooling the cubs, there is a high probability that he will feed the magic beast. Hudson just wanted to find a topic to chat with, but he wasn't going to kill anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luck, who can say for sure? Miss Melissa, you are so beautiful, maybe someday a monster will come to your door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like my Earth Bear, it actually delivered itself. The first time we met was in my tent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the host, I just treated it to a big meal, and then we became friends. It was this chance encounter that it concluded a partnership contract with me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't want to pretend, but if that set of magical tricks were spoken out, it would really damage his stalwart influence as Baron Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply concealing it in good faith is good for everyone. Bear Stearns, who wanted to be the bear in question, didn't want to let the matter leak out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, that is the dark history in its bear life. If it spreads out, the eternal reputation of the Earth Bear clan will be completely buried by it.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As for the experience of the magicians in domesticating magic pets, it was directly ignored by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conquering monsters with strength, conquering the hearts of monsters with strength, is that something that humans can do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really a fight with the bears, ten Hudsons are not enough for Bear Stearns. A casual slap would make this little knight get down on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder there are very few people who can obtain magic pets. It is no wonder that such a primitive capture method is so efficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being beaten to death by a monster is a testimony of strength. In order to increase the odds of winning, it is best to find a Warcraft cub to challenge. If you are unlucky and happen to meet their parents, it will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Melissa's envious eyes, Hudson could only express his helplessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone can meet a bear that has been \"famished and fed\" since birth. It's hard to make an arrogant Warcraft bow down for food without going hungry for several years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the whole banquet, the two of them communicated together, which made Hudson fail to do any serious business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From Arbor County to the Academy of Magic, from the southeastern province to the continent of Aslante, Hudson admired himself for being able to handle the wide range of topics and the divergence of thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the envious and jealous eyes of the nobles, Hudson spent a not-so-good night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the beauty is good, it is not so easy to win. Unlike the ordinary noble lady who lived in her hometown and traveled only a hundred miles away, Melissa had seen the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the southeastern province, Hudson belongs to the best wave, but looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, it can only be regarded as not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who attract the most attention are always the children of the big family. Melissa has a brain without following the moths to the flame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good thing to have a brain. Unfortunately, the smarter a person is, the more he knows how to weigh the pros and cons, and the correspondingly, the harder it is to be emotional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others only saw the two having a happy conversation, but Hudson knew very well that the two of them were at most ordinary friends now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's like the process of a blind date. Everyone thinks that each other's conditions are good in all aspects, and they can continue to understand each other in depth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the end of the banquet, the matter came to an end temporarily, and the window paper was not pierced after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The parties do not object, it is only one of the foundations of the family marriage. In the follow-up matter, the two families have to weigh the pros and cons of all aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The duration in between can range from three to five months to two or three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the two parties reach an agreement, this kind of thing will not be discussed outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is flat, as if nothing happened. However, Hudson's business in Arbor County is still much more convenient. Obviously, this is Viscount Oran's kindness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In less than three days, Hudson finalized all the deals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One thousand nine hundred households of serfs, a total of nine thousand eight hundred and forty-five men, women and children, five hundred and twenty-three cattle, eight hundred and seventy-four rough horses, two thousand three hundred and forty-five sheep, all kinds of grain A total of 1.3 million pounds...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The above is all the gains. As a price, Hudson not only paid all the goods, but also owed the local nobles 34,576 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Debt piles up. It's just that Hudson at this moment can't see the slightest panic, but appears extremely calm and calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Debts do not necessarily have to be repaid with gold coins, and other equivalent commodities can also be traded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Master Hudson's products still continue to have high negative reviews in the past, it still does not affect the sales of the products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an era when the cost-effectiveness of alternative products is extremely low, the product only needs to be practical. The nitpicking of details can be completely ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Increased a debt of more than 34,000 gold coins. From another perspective, isn't this an increase in a huge order?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, nobles used to buy pig iron by themselves to make farm tools and daily necessities. Driven by debt, now everyone can accept the finished product offered by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I paid a little discount, everything is worth it compared to taking the payment in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem facing Hudson now is: how to transport these people and materials back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles are willing to take out these things to trade. In addition to the conditions agreed in advance, a large part of the reason is that the local population is overpopulated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of situation will appear as long as the territory is in peace for a hundred and eighty years. The way the lords dealt with it was also very rough and simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly stipulate a certain period of time: men and women are not allowed to marry, and couples are not allowed to have intercourse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Births stagnate for a period of time, and within a few years the excess population will soon be balanced again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the lords are in charge of more than that. Some warm-hearted lords also formulated a birth schedule, clearly stipulating the time when couples have intercourse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through human intervention, control the pregnancy time of the citizens, so that the birth of children can avoid the busy farming season and cold winter, so as to improve the safety of women's childbirth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar wonderful decrees. In this crazy world, only noble lords can't think of it, and there is no lord who can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Baron Hudson, who lacks population, can only envy him. Not to mention restricting births, if the supporting infrastructure could not keep up, he would have enacted laws to encourage births.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The failure to exchange more population was not because these lords were unwilling to trade, but mainly because Baron Hudson, who had once again become poorer, did not have enough funds to compensate other lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Credit is not unlimited. With the title of \"Knight of the Bow\" and \"Merchant of Inferior Weapons and Arms\", it is only worth this price in everyone's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It exceeds people's expectations, and everyone has to worry about his repayment ability. Even if there is a mine at home, it can't dispel everyone's concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few days of delay, the huge team was finally organized. The cows and horses that were traded were all harnessed to carts, not only to pull food, but also to carry children and pregnant women with disabilities on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the attrition on the road, the benevolent Master Hudson spent a lot of money to hire three priests and more than a dozen priest apprentices to accompany them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although a medical team of this size is a drop in the bucket compared with a team of 10,000 people, Hudson has really tried his best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only about four hundred miles away. If you still can't handle it, you can only be the survival of the fittest by nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original mercenary guard has now passively transformed into a team manager. Hudson can fully understand the endless resentment deep in the hearts of the knights, but gold coins have not been easy to earn since ancient times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the so-called \"high price\" must have pitfalls, how can you do it if you don't do more work after taking the high employment fee from Master Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that this trick is very effective. Under the eyes of the noble lord, all the serfs behaved extraordinarily well-behaved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are countless people among them, they don't want to leave their hometown. However, in front of the nobles, no matter how many complaints they have in their hearts, they dare not express it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson could do nothing about it. In order to boost morale, he even slaughtered 30 sheep in one breath, plus a wild deer he hunted by chance, so that everyone could have a good meal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only that, in order to reduce unnecessary attrition, Hudson also spent a lot of money to purchase warm clothes for everyone, and even put shoes on everyone's feet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics support along the way is also to send people to contact the nobles who have made good friends early to ensure that they can eat hot meals when they arrive at the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the house, it can only be resigned. With a team of tens of thousands of people, not every noble family is capable of arranging accommodation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But just taking care of the old and the young is still barely able to do it. As for the others, naturally they could only make do with sleeping around a bonfire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All preparations are in place, and the team slowly embarks on the journey. Twenty-five miles a day is already the limit of the team's speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the good logistics support along the way, it is estimated that it may not be possible to travel fifteen miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Riding a war horse, holding the sleeping bear cub in his arms, Hudson couldn't help complaining secretly: This **** winter is really...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, groups of ragged orc slaves in the northern border were driving southward with whips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kobolds, piggies, ratmen, catmen, tauren, goblins... hundreds of orc races all appeared in the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Tauren, Leopard, and Wild Boar who have a little fighting power...have their hands and feet in shackles, and often dozens of people are connected in series, making it difficult to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many orc slaves going south, it's hard not to attract attention. If it weren't for those powerful races, their hands and feet were shackled, and it is estimated that the guards along the way would not dare to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, **** these tauren, leopard, and wild boar... to the south, and sell them to the Colosseum in the south, and you can earn a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But ratmen, piggies, goblins... What's the use of sending these **** things? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is that piggy looking at? It's just you garbage, why are you still not convinced?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same ancestor, although the wild boar man is not very smart, at least he has a lot of strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not like you lazy guys who eat and sleep all day long, even uncivilized pigs are more diligent than you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the soldier's whip had already been raised. The unlucky Pig who just glanced at it was instantly screamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Alicias. You have killed three slaves along the way, and we won't be able to do business if this continues.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's what he said, but from the contemptuous eyes of the middle-aged officer, it can be seen that he didn't care about the life and death of these slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Northland, slaves like Pig, even if they only sell one silver coin, no one cares about them. For worthless goods, life and death are naturally unimportant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, you can't blame me for this. The bodies of these trash are too weak, and they can fall down when the wind blows. I didn't even use my strength, and they died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on their bodies, it is estimated that if they can't reach the southeastern province, half of them will fall down. If you are worried about their life and death, then you have something to worry about. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aliches said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knowing that their bodies are weak, you can still laugh, you bastard. You know, these slaves were sent to Master Sith by the order of the Grand Duke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were too many casualties on the way, your captain and I would not be able to do the job, and you boy would not have a good life. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged officer said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He called him Master Sith, but deep down he never regarded Baron Sith as a master. Failure to obtain the surname of the Felix family meant that the gold content of the word \"Master\" was doomed to be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had it not been for the order of Grand Duke Kavadia, he would not have been willing to undertake the drudgery of escorting slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, what are you afraid of? These useless trash, I guess Baron Sith is going to go there, and they can only show blood to the recruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the reproduction speed of these rubbish, one or two thousand more, or one or two thousand less, can be made up quickly, which is not a big deal at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the group of strong slaves don't break too much, it's not a big problem. Especially the group of rabbit girls and fox girls in the carriage...is the focus of Master Sith's attention. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was nothing at first, but after Alicias said it, I felt that things changed a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cautious middle-aged officer hurriedly reprimanded: \"Shut up, Alicias, you idiot. Can you say these things in your capacity?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember, Alicias. Master Sith wanted these slaves for territory development. Even the bunny girl, fox girl, and cat **** the carriage... are also used for communication between nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the rest, no matter who asks, you don't know anything! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having worked for the Felix family for generations, the middle-aged military officer also somewhat knows the cruelty of some big families' infighting after hearing about it for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the big people above will not have any big things, but the little people involved usually will not have any good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar **** teams, and they all have the same destination in the southeast province. By this time, the news had already spread in the North.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that there is a shortage of labor in the territory of the noble children who went south. The problem of labor shortage also exists in Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the frequent invasion of orcs, the population of the North Land has never been able to increase. Even with the continuous support of the kingdom, it can only be maintained at a minimum balance point, and it is simply unable to support the southern territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transporting orc slaves became the only option. Anyway, the southeast province is thousands of miles away, completely unaffected by the orc empire, and there is no need to worry about being disturbed by domesticating orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether orcs can become qualified farmers, no one can answer this question for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are so many races of orcs, there might be one race that is suitable for farming and can be domesticated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth was exposed, and many slave-hunting families were very hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching their neighbors, sending slaves to the southern territories, their hearts bleed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After exhausting their minds, the slaves captured from the orc empire by venturing northward were thrown into their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xuefeng leader, Viscount Rex is one of the unlucky ones. Thinking that he was being taken advantage of and wanted to collect the garbage from the orc empire, he hastily ordered the slave hunting team in his family to act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, all kinds of messy slaves arrested thousands of people, only to find out suddenly that there were no buyers in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn Hank Cage, the slave I captured so hard, he actually tried to buy it at the price of five copper coins per person!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just because of having many sons that they established a territory in the south? Usually it's nothing more than a joke, but now he still wants to take advantage of the situation to rob him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The violent scene made all the servants in the mansion tremble. The lack of sons is Viscount Rex's biggest shortcoming. Although he has worked very hard, it is a pity that he still has only one seedling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a family, it is undoubtedly very dangerous to have only one direct heir. However, if the Lord of Dawn did not bless him, Viscount Rex could only accept his fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, having a single seedling in the family is better than having no single seedlings and having to work for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of self-comforting words can only be secretly thought by Viscount Rex, if other people dare to say it, it will definitely lead to big things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time this issue is involved, the servants in the family retreat one after another, fearing that they will be angered and burn themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler who just appeared directly opposite, unable to escape, could only influence the scalp and persuade him: \"Master, Viscount Hank Cage can't understand your kindness. If you don't want these slaves, then we won't take advantage of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are dozens of nobles who have opened up territories in the south, and it is impossible for everyone to collect enough slaves. Discount sale, no worries about no buyers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although deep down in his heart, he understood Viscount Hank Cage's actions very well, but his identity made him have to stand on the side of his master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too late, all the teams escorting the slaves have already set off, only that idiot Hank Cage is still dawdling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even a waste like him has enough slaves, so how can others be short? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Rex said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just staying a few days longer when going out to visit friends, I missed the best time for slaves to get rid of them, so that thousands of slaves were completely smashed into their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are occasional slave traders who express interest, they are only interested in a small number of races. More than 90% of the slaves are free gifts that no one wants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mix and match and sell, it is very difficult to sell. If someone picks out all the good ones, there is no need to sell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for worrying about the reputation of brutality, he would have ordered all the useless slaves in his hands to be pulled out and slaughtered, so as not to waste food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carnage cannot be played, and release is also impossible. Humans and beasts are incompatible, and the blood feud accumulated for countless years has already penetrated deep into the bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the issue of dealing with orcs, there have long been unspoken rules among the northern nobles. It has never been heard that after the capture of orc slaves, there are still unconditional releases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really releases people, at least the orcs will have to pay some ransom, so that he can be ashamed! Otherwise, he will be ridiculed for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, no one paid attention to the whole process. Even if he sent letters to the orc tribe, no one came to accompany him to perform this redemption scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, it is not an option to keep them idle. Leaving them to cultivate the land will easily lead to collusion with the orc empire, which will affect the security of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, we will follow the example of those families and transport this group of slaves to the south to see if any nobles are interested there?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it still can't be sold, this back and forth can at least reduce the number of employees by one-third. If it doesn't work, hire someone to rob them halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as people are not in our hands, what happens later has nothing to do with us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old housekeeper suggested helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My master is too shameless to worry about the poor handling of the slaves in his hands. But whenever they met a ruthless nobleman, these slaves would have been dealt with long ago.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Especially after entering Wright County, it attracted countless eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the two counties of Wright and Wyton, the Hudson family is the only one with a population of over 10,000. It was already enough to attract people's envy, but now that there is such a big commotion, it will cause even more hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone hadn't been beaten by Earl Pierce not long ago, and the aftermath has not passed, they might all come out to block the road and rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing can only be thought about secretly. There are only a few nobles who are capable of robbing this team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a joint operation, any one of them will have to think twice before coming over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a question of whether the robbery can be successful. The key is that the price to be paid is too high, and few can afford it, let alone worry about revenge afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the best way to collect wool is to set up a card to increase the toll tax, and get a share of the pie openly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local aristocrats are forced by favor and cannot do this. The northern nobles don't need to give face to the \"Knight of the Bow\", but unfortunately they have to worry about getting burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turmoil of economic sanctions has just passed, and the nobles of the Northland who have tried hard, no one wants to come a second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone makes a bad start and attracts the neighbors to follow suit, they will be the ones who will be unlucky in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst thing is that the toll tax was not received, and someone beat him up instead. That is the tragedy of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, collecting taxes in the continent of Aslante has always been the exclusive property of the strong, and only the weak pay taxes to the strong, and it has never been reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially if you want the taxes of the nobles, the prerequisite is that your fists are harder than theirs. Otherwise, it would be impossible to put it away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson's logistical preparations were very adequate, the team arrived at the territory slowly, but there was still a double-digit attrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only four hundred miles away. I can't imagine the price those big immigrants who traveled thousands of miles without any logistical support will have to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules of the mercenary world, Hudson readily paid the commission and delay fee, and sent away a group of reluctant knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more people and more things. Although Hudson made preparations in advance and arranged for his subordinates to build houses early, the number of people far exceeded expectations, and in the end the serfs could only make do with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Residence is only a small problem. As the serfs at the bottom of society, the requirements in this regard have never been higher. As long as the house is sheltered from the wind and rain, a little cramped space is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the difficulties are only temporary. The generous Master Hudson has never been stingy in allocating land and building houses for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are food reserves, and this wave has brought a lot, so there is no need to worry about it for the time being; pots, pans, and pans can be produced by ourselves, and there has never been a shortage; there is plenty in the firewood mountain, and the withered and yellow leaves can make do for a while, serfs We just need to do it ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Material difficulties basically do not exist. The real trouble is the population growth, which brings management difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Hudson directly introduced the original Baojia system. The grouping is based on households, with a head of household; ten households are Jia, with a chief; ten Jia are Bao, with a chief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Further up, then only the Lord's Mansion can directly govern it. This is not a question of whether to decentralize power or not. It is really a matter of lack of talent among serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talents who can manage a hundred households are rare among the serfs. If you add more burdens to them, you must make a mess of things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the entire territory has a total of more than 3,000 households, and more than 30 security chiefs have been connected. The management pressure of the Lord's Mansion has been greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The system of continuous guarantee and continuous sitting has undoubtedly been followed. Each household is issued a wooden stamp, which states the household's population and employment status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone goes out of the house, or if there is a visitor, they must indicate their whereabouts, and report to the Chief Jia and the Chief Security Officer. If there is any suspicious person, immediately report to the Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All households jointly serve as guarantors. If one family commits a crime and fails to report it in time, the other households will sit together in accordance with the law and bear the punishment together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feudalism can no longer be feudal, and it is the peak system of the feudal system. But Hudson no longer has the time to think so much, no matter whether the system is good or bad, having a system is better than not having one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the serfs, we can see that there is not much resistance to this harsh system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly for serfs, most of the constraints are actually approximately equal to zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the lord recruits, most people will not leave the territory from birth to death. All social circles and social relations are also limited to the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around, they are all acquaintances who know each other well, and those who are familiar with each other cannot be more familiar. The family education that everyone has received since childhood has made them despise the existence of restlessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the source of population in the territory was not too complicated, Hudson would not have come up with this Baojia system. It's not that the system is bad, but that it really doesn't need to be so complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the closed territorial economy model, as long as the lord can barely feed everyone, the order of the territory will be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The solidified social class and long-term enslavement education have stifled the ideological development of serfs. Once people get used to everything around them, it is difficult to get out of their own cognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is dedicated to construction, naturally has no time to play with ideological revolution. Changing the world, such a great thing, we should wait until we stand on top of the world before thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same thing is done by different people, and the results are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The social innovation initiated by the big guys is called changing the world; the social innovation initiated by the little people is just to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a struggling lord, everything Hudson does has only one core—enhancing the strength of the territory and improving his survivability in the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the substantial population growth, the previous territorial development plan was overthrown by Hudson again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first thing to ensure is the production of the mining area. Without any hesitation, he took the lead in adding a thousand young men to increase the output of ironware.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infrastructure of some territories is also on the agenda. For example: roads, the lord's mansion, and water conservancy projects all have to be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of complicated things that make Hudson's scalp tingle, but there is no capable assistant available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Hudson borrowed the housekeepers of several relatives, it barely guaranteed the normal operation of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people have rich management experience and decent execution ability, but they lack decision-making ability. The important decision-making affairs of the territory are still all on Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce administrative pressure, Hudson had to reduce the number of projects and postpone the construction of the temporarily unimportant castle indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Road construction is also limited to widening the road out of the mining area. As for roads in other areas, maintenance is the main focus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Water conservancy projects are mainly to repair ditches in plain areas, and there are no large-scale water conservancy facilities projects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the southeast province is accustomed to good weather conditions, and the annual rainfall is sufficient to meet agricultural production. At least relying on the Huanhua River, the irrigation of crops in the territorial plains is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the hilly areas, the land has not even been developed, and it is still too early to talk about irrigation. However, it is very necessary to dig a pond above the small soil bag to store water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are things that need to be completed in the future, and the immediate task is to open up wasteland first. With the current productivity, the tens of thousands of acres of land on the plain cannot support the more than 20,000 people in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the addition of some breeding staff who are responsible for taking care of the livestock, the rest of the labor force was sent by Hudson to open up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small hill can no longer satisfy Baron Hudson's appetite. At least two hills must be developed before spring plowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The increased livestock and labor are the confidence for him to implement the land reclamation plan. 20,000 mu is the most basic goal. Regardless of the output of the new land, the land must be opened first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a newly opened territory, the easiest way to stabilize people's hearts is to open up enough land and harvest enough food. As long as the granary is full of grain, the hearts of the people will naturally be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, outsourcing like Hudson does not count. Serfs have no thoughts, which is restricted by the social environment, but they still have the most basic common sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bought food will eventually be eaten up one day, and no matter how rich the mine's harvest is, they will not feel it. Only the food grown by oneself can make everyone feel at ease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the yield per mu is low, as long as the total yield is high enough, everyone's sense of security will be cultivated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the people's hearts are stable, is the beginning of the real rooting of the territory. This often takes time to settle, and it cannot be completed overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire, the Bimon Imperial Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The falling snowflakes covered the city with silver makeup. However, the severe cold can't dispel people's enthusiasm. At this moment, countless people in the city are decorating with lanterns and festoons to celebrate the great Emperor Behemoth's 300th birthday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Beamon Great who brought the Orc Empire to its peak, regardless of his strength or prestige, he was able to stabilize the other four emperors, but there was no smile on his face at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sorrow and joy are often momentary, and it should have been a good day for celebration. Emperor Behemoth once again ushered in the pain of bereavement in his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Heir, died again and again.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like a topic of farce, but it has been staged in the Beamon royal family again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Boiling to death the four crown princes was already enough to make Emperor Bimeng sad, but it happened to be in time for this auspicious day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order, all the celebrations today will be cancelled, and mourn for my poor emperor!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the trembling voice, it can be heard how broken the heart of Emperor Behemoth is at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guests attending the celebration banquet were also at a loss by the sudden scene. A happy event suddenly turned into a funeral, and everyone's emotions couldn't be adjusted for a while!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, Emperor Bimon just died of his son, no matter how strong his mentality is, it is impossible to continue to celebrate his birthday on this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless guests present cursed at the dead Crown Prince Beimeng, you can't drink, drink less!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's all right, the unlucky Crown Prince Bimon died immediately, but what about the guests who had toasted?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are also victims, they don't even know that the Crown Prince has a “great addiction to food”, but it is obviously unrealistic to reason with an old man who is suffering from the pain of bereavement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he is the greatest emperor of the orc empire, at this moment, he is still just a father who lost his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inevitable to suffer anger. If it didn't explode on the spot, it was because the heart of Emperor Bimeng was strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be a similar scene, and I have experienced three waves before. The first time is raw, the second time is familiar, the third time is four times, and the inner endurance is exercised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suppressing the grief, after announcing the funeral for his son, the grief-stricken Behemoth embraced the dead crown prince and turned away, leaving a group of guests staring at each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitating for long, all the guests who reacted took their leave one after another. If you don't run away now, whether you can get away later is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dares to bet on what kind of crazy things a three-hundred-year-old man who just suffered the pain of bereavement can do next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this old man, out of breath, wants to drag everyone to bury his hapless son, that would be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of the banquet hall, all the guests unleashed their greatest potential and headed straight for the city gate at the fastest speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know, but I thought they did something bad and ended up running for their lives in a hurry. As the parties involved, they no longer care about explanations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An accident happened to the upper crown prince, which set off a **** storm in the orc empire. Countless irrelevant unlucky people have been implicated in it, and no one wants to follow in the footsteps of these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you will find that the representatives of the other four royal families are also in the running team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, everyone is a smart person, and they know very well that their fate is their own, and there is only one. Unwilling to stay, betting on whether Emperor Behemoth can maintain his sanity in the pain of losing his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring the thoughts of these guys, holding his son's body, the Great Behemoth, who was marching forward with heavy steps, entered an underground secret passage after going through twists and turns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the illumination of the ever-burning lamps on both sides of the secret passage, the murals on the wall are constantly changing patterns, as if they are alive, and the scene is extraordinarily weird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Behemoth, who was walking in the secret path, seemed to be used to all this, and continued to move forward without paying attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pace became faster and faster, and even the wrinkles on his forehead gradually disappeared. No matter what he looked like, he didn't look like an old man in his dying years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He stopped and stopped all the way, knocking on the mechanism continuously, and it lasted for more than half an hour before he came out of the secret passage and came to a mysterious underground palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the palace, there are already densely packed coffins, among which the five hanging coffins floating in the center are the most peculiar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly below the hanging coffin is a magic array with countless lines, split into five-pointed stars, it should be a mysterious five-star array.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw that Emperor Behemoth slowly put his son's body into an empty hanging coffin, and said sadly: \"Terry, don't blame the father for being cruel, so that your soul will not be at peace after death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to blame, you can only blame your own bad luck. I have already given you a chance. As long as you can live longer and survive my old immortal father, you can inherit this huge empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that you, and your restless elder brothers, are all short-lived ghosts, and they are all ahead of being a father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you are so unfilial and let me bear the pain of bereavement again and again, then I simply bear enough, and let you continue my life!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's up to your little brother. As a father, I will also give him a chance, as long as he can kill me, he will be the new Emperor Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unbearable, you will die before being a father just like you gang of short-lived ghosts. Then it's the will of the Beast God, and it's up to me to turn the world around and win this great opportunity to break through the sanctuary! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the four hanging coffins in the hall exuded endless resentment, as if expressing their inner unwillingness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all of this has no effect on Menghuang. As an emperor, he has no regrets in his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment they brought their corpses into the secret palace, the so-called father-son relationship no longer existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if infected, the surrounding coffins also trembled, and endless resentment continued to emanate, as if to swallow Bimenghuang alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that after these grievances came into contact with Emperor Bimon, they not only failed to harm him, but were swallowed by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the action of the mysterious magic circle, these swallowed grievances were gradually stripped away, leaving only the purest qi remaining in Emperor Bimon's body, gradually transforming into a strange force of vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resentment stripped out did not disappear, but fell into the five suspended coffins. Vaguely, one could still hear the cry from the depths of the soul inside the coffin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One of the five coffins was missing, and the last grievance seemed to find no object to be pinned on, and finally returned to Emperor Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Behemoth, who had regained his youth, returned to his dying state under the ravages of resentment, but his complexion was much better than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Behemoth seemed to be familiar with all the changes in front of him, and he didn't even have the most basic mood swings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Although the resentment is still strong, it has weakened a bit compared to the last time. It seems that even the top powerhouses in the mainland cannot withstand the ravages of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you can rest assured, the demeanor above the sanctuary, I will appreciate it for you. If your souls have not dissipated by then, I will come back and tell you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to thank me, these are what I should do. After all, without your offerings, it would be very difficult for me to get the chance to take this step in this era. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the corpse in the coffin still maintains its spirituality. After being stimulated by the words of Emperor Bimon, the coffin trembled more and more violently, as if it might break out at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, there is no need to be so enthusiastic to stay. If the beast **** blesses, maybe it won't be long before we meet again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made my youngest son also a short-lived ghost?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a father, I have warned him countless times to practice hard and strive to break through to a higher level as soon as possible, but that **** knows how to eat, drink and play all day long, so he deserves it...\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Especially the death of four princes in a row is simply unprecedented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people in the outside world suspected that Emperor Bimeng was cursed and had to endure the pain of bereavement. The casino even made a handicap, betting on who would die first, the next crown prince or Emperor Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to know that the fifth crown prince has not yet been decided?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bimeng Emperor Yingming I, the first four sons all inherited his brilliance and martial arts, and each of them was a momentary talent. Only the youngest son Alex, who was stimulated in his youth, became self-deprecating and spent his days drinking and drinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an existence is obviously not suitable to be the heir of the Bimon Imperial Court. On the contrary, there are several outstanding talents in the grandchildren who are more suitable to inherit the Bimon Imperial Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concerning the candidate for the crown prince, there are also constant disputes within the Bimon imperial court. It's just that Emperor Bimon had just experienced the pain of losing his son, and no one dared to bring up this sensitive topic for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the turmoil of the heir to the Beamon royal family, the entire orc empire was not peaceful. Emperor Bimeng, who had not yet come out of the pain of bereavement, could not help venting his anger after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the orc nobles who participated in the celebration banquet were panicked, especially the unlucky guy who was drinking with Crown Prince Terry, felt like he was facing an abyss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    God of the beast, if they knew that a few glasses of wine could take away the crown prince, they would never go up for that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these weak explanations don't make any sense. The aged Behemoth seemed like a wayward child, just catching these unlucky **** and constantly scratching their pigtails.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the handle is caught, it will be a thunderbolt in an instant. Even if the other four imperial courts wanted to stop it, they couldn't stop Emperor Bimeng's determination to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deeply felt Emperor Bimon's \"earnest love for his son\", the whole orc empire dared not say more about the heir to the Bimeng court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, after receiving the news that Emperor Bimon had lost his son again, Caesar III didn't feel sore in his waist or legs anymore, and he even ate a big extra bowl for dinner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for his good self-cultivation, which allowed him to restrain his emotions, he would probably have already started throwing wine to celebrate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Terry, that little **** is dead. That old man is the last son of Alex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this guy's fame spread far and wide. It is said that there are female slaves from all ethnic groups in the mainland gathered in the mansion, and even the succubus from the abyss are not spared, and they play and play at home all day and night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only contribution of the Beamon family is to verify—which races Beamon can combine with to give birth to offspring, and created more than 300 strange-looking grandchildren for the old immortal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think it is possible for this guy to be made the heir apparent? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the expectation in the words that he really hopes that Alex can become the new Beamon Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, we are good neighbors. Under the guiding ideology that you are strong and I am weak, everyone wants the other party to die, so how can they expect the other party to live well?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I'm afraid it will be a little difficult. Compared with Prince Alex's depravity, there are many talents among Emperor Bimeng's grandchildren who are more suitable to be the crown prince than him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this youngest son was once the most beloved son of Emperor Bimeng, in the past hundred years or so, this guy has not thought about making progress and spends his days drinking and drinking, which has disappointed Emperor Bimeng greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an emperor, Emperor Bimon must consider the inheritance of the Bimon family. At this time, it would be irresponsible for the Bimon family to forcibly make Prince Alex the Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the inheritance system of the Orc Empire is different from ours. Beast emperors in all dynasties were always held by the most powerful sons. Even if Alex was established as the crown prince, it would be difficult for him to inherit the throne smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps knowing this, just after Crown Prince Terry passed away, Prince Alex has repeatedly stated in public that he has no interest in the position of Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Emperor Beamon really loved his son, he would fulfill Prince Alex, instead of forcing him to the hot **** position of Prince Chu. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs of the Alpha Kingdom, he has the deepest understanding of the Orc Empire. Although the Bimon family is powerful, the other four royal families are not vegetarians either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the mighty Emperor Behemoth, the four royal families could only stand aside. If Alex, the playboy, went up, the situation would be quite different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dig a few holes for him to jump at will, the advantages of the Beamon clan will be consumed soon, and it is almost impossible to keep the current interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what Grand Duke Afiero is talking about is just a state of rationality. However, the aged Behemoth seems to be irrational now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Terry died of a normal life, and Beamon who can live to be 257 years old is considered a long life. After all, not all Behemoths can live as well as Behemoth Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Emperor Beamon didn't think so, and blamed the death of Crown Prince Terry on the heads of irrelevant people, and made a big liquidation within the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the elderly Beamon Emperor had lost his mind in the pain of continuous bereavement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His next approach may be more emotional than rational. It is not impossible to forcibly make Prince Alex the Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this flamboyant prince is not welcome within the Beamon clan, other orc races support him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the other four royal families, it is estimated that they will find ways to push Alex to the top. Alex, who has many supporters, actually has the foundation to secure the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the final game result comes out, I can only say that everything is possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I personally think that Prince Alex has the greatest probability of being crown prince. He is not only the only living son of Emperor Bimeng, but also the most ideal heir in the eyes of all major forces. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics and military are two different levels, and adding human nature will undoubtedly make things more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two different opinions are intertwined, and each has its own reasons. Naturally, no one can convince the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers are also constantly expressing their opinions. Although they generally come to these two conclusions, everyone's reasons are varied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people think that the Beamon Emperor knew that his lifespan was coming to an end, so he wanted to select an outstanding talent from among his grandchildren and make him the crown prince, so as to continue the glory of the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people think that Emperor Bimon's lifespan has not yet come to an end, but Prince Alex, who spends his days drinking and drinking, seems to have a few years to live. Out of respect for his sons, Emperor Beamon appointed Prince Alex as Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the prince does not have the longevity of the emperor, and it is impossible to truly inherit the throne. It does not matter whether he has the ability to rule the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people think that a civil war may break out in the Orc Empire around the battle for the crown prince of Bimon, and the Alpha Kingdom needs to be prepared to take the opportunity to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More people, more opinions. A mess of suggestions came together, mixed with what they thought was sufficient reasons, and Caesar III only felt that he had a big head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Alpha Kingdom has a sound inheritance system. From the moment of birth, the order of succession to the throne has been determined, and there are very few accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no clear standard like the orc empire, members of the royal family in the direct line have a chance to rise to the top, and it is unknown what the trouble will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, it doesn't matter who will be in power in the end of the Beamon clan, we only need to support the one that is most beneficial to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our position has no effect on the Orc Empire, it is the right way for everyone to express their position. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a fact. As a hostile force, the Orc Empire never needs to consider the position of the Alpha Kingdom, and vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unable to change the final outcome, then simply act according to your own interests. It doesn't matter whether you succeed in the end or not. Anyway, it's just a matter of yelling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still many countries that have made similar decisions. They seem to be actively participating in international affairs, but in fact they are just watching the excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more turmoil in the Orc Empire, the more peaceful the Aslante continent will be. If the orcs stop making trouble, then a new round of continental war will almost begin soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the human race will be involved, those races that have a covenant with the orc empire will also be involved with a high probability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The times are different. The days when a single family was singled out against the human world are long gone forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now humans are the overlord of the continent of Aslante, and only by joining hands can all races hope to suppress this overlord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the nations of mankind are not monolithic, and the fighting in internal fighting is no less than external, which reduces the pressure on all ethnic groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, under the pressure of survival, all races on the continent might join the anti-human alliance initiated by the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Xindel, how is your progress? Crown Prince Terry has passed away. This is the best opportunity to get in touch with the power core of the Orc Empire.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not as simple as you said, Alex is just a puddle of mud that can't support the wall, no matter how I encourage him, he has no interest in the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I can replace him, then there is no problem, and I can immediately participate in the crown prince competition. It's a pity that I'm just a concubine in the mansion, and I can't be the master of others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A flower farmer dressed as a servant and a beautiful woman in gorgeous clothes are funny enough, but they can still have a conversation in such a tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this scene gets out, two more bones must be added to the prince's mansion. Prince Alex is just drinking and drinking, but it doesn't mean that he is a messy master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are countless people who sneak into the mansion every year, but the end result of these people is not very good. After all, the prince is famous for liking the new and disliking the old. No matter how favored a concubine is, it is difficult to survive three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to lurk in this kind of place without much pressure. For the guy who always urges her, Xiandale naturally doesn't like it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In any case, we have to find a way to try. Compared with other Beamon royal families, Alex is the best to control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we can't control him, other orc royal families who want to shake the status of the Beamon clan will find ways to encourage him to invade the south. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handy said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who took over the undercover orc empire and provoked the drudgery of the orc invasion south?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the blood succession system of human countries, every change of throne in the orc empire is accompanied by **** winds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ruler who was killed in the internal strife, how can it be easy to fool?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that you are fooling the other party, even if you want to get in touch, it is very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, I can only choose Prince Alex who is full of flaws as the starting point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this Lord, although he is very close, is really a wandering cloud and a wild crane. There is only one purpose in life: to eat, drink and be merry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The position of crown prince, which countless people long for and cannot achieve, is a hot potato in this person's eyes, and he wishes to throw it far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't daydream, Alex is just a salted fish. He is drunk all day long, and with his physical condition, even if he gets the crown prince, there is a high probability that he will not be able to survive the Beamon Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time Alex took us into the palace for fun, the old man just took a look at it from a distance, and it made my heart tremble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe that old guy has secretly broken through the sanctuary. With the lifespan of the Beamon clan, even those who survived for another three hundred years may still be alive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chandal complained angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the task assigned by the above, she was basically desperate. If it wasn't for her involuntary control, she would have wanted to screw it up completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, we have already prepared. This is the water of life exchanged from the elves, which has the ability to repair the body and prolong life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex's body is indeed broken, but with the help of this drop of water of life, he can live another ten or eight years without any problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If within this time limit, we still cannot inherit the throne, our mission has already failed. What happens next has nothing to do with you and me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handy said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an intelligence officer, what I am most afraid of is meeting an unreliable boss and assigning a bunch of unrealistic tasks. Unfortunately, they unfortunately ran into each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are unrealistic tasks assigned, but they are also the highest level of mandatory tasks. Rather than go back and accept severe punishment if you can't finish it, it's better to simply wipe your neck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is only one of the action teams, they are far from the only spies of the Holy See lurking in the Orc Empire, and some teams have even been lurking for generations, but this does not affect the difficulty of the task in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bringing, intimidation, and lures, these low-level small methods are only effective for the middle and lower classes. The real upper echelons of the orc empire are not threatened at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even mastering the dark history of the big shots is useless, because the guys at the top don't care about the so-called ethics at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc empire launches a war of invasion to the south in the near future, it is also the will of the big men, not a few small spies, who can make decisions for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real role of spies has always been to collect intelligence. In this world where bloodlines determine status, the probability of a spy being able to become a boss with decision-making power is infinitely close to zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a counterattack, it is lurking inside the human kingdom, not in the orc kingdom with different races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Water of life, such a good thing is willing to take out. It seems that the guys above really spent their money this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if we can get it, how can we guarantee that others don't have it? Maybe it's been used before, we just don't know it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the hatred between the orc empire and the elves was thousands of years ago. Under the passage of time, it has long since disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as those big men are willing to pay the price, it is not impossible to exchange some water of life from the elves, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiandale asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the water of life is rare, it is only for ordinary people. If there is a big man willing to spend money, the elves will still trade, otherwise there will be no such thing in the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I wasn't sure in the past, but in recent decades, the elves have no water of life flowing out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the grassland elves, wood elves, or night elves, there is no news of trading water of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What exactly happened, we don't know. Anyway, the water of life has become extremely scarce now, even if there is a collection in the Beamon clan, there is a high probability that it will be used by the Beamon emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, why can he survive until now, while the previous crown princes have all come ahead of him? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handy said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the most recognized statement on the mainland. After all, Emperor Bimeng's lifespan is far beyond the normal level, and it is impossible without the use of life-extending treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many things that can prolong life in the Aslant Continent, but the water of life is undoubtedly the most famous. Although it cannot make people live longer, it is still very hopeful to live for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the elves were not strong enough, and the World Tree could only conceive the water of life in the hands of the elves, it would have been looted long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, the elves are in constant trouble. Almost all races have found their bad luck in their prosperous times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, I can only take out the precious water of life from time to time to trade with the big shots of various ethnic groups to reduce being peeped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the best, but how to send things up is also a troublesome matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Alex seems to have no ambitions, he is definitely not as incompetent in the eyes of the outside world as he has been able to enjoy himself for so many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the details are not handled well, it is easy to arouse his suspicion. This guy seems to be a kind of love, but in fact he is a ungrateful person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once he finds out that my identity is wrong, he will never show mercy. Even if you have the merit of offering the water of life, it doesn't need to keep you and me alive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiandale said with a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to thrive in the prince's mansion as a concubine is due to the precise control of human nature. She knows exactly who the person next to her pillow is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today is still endless tenderness, tomorrow may be unfeeling. Every year, there are countless concubines who are tired of being played with, or are thrown into the cold palace, or are given out as gifts, or are rewarded to their subordinates.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although Hudson is also concerned about current affairs, the change of crown prince of the Beamon family is obviously too far away from him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the sudden southward invasion of the Orc Empire, no matter how shocking the news, it will not affect Hudson's farming plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one heir dies, aren't there still countless heirs? Emperor Bimon was a blessed man. Although his sons passed away one after another, they had many grandchildren!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Alex alone has created more than 300 people for him, and with the contributions of other princes, even if it has not reached 400, it is not far from this number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plus great-grandsons, great-great-great-grandsons... It is estimated that there will be several regiments. If you live a few decades longer than Emperor Meng, maybe the descendants of Guang's direct line will be able to form an army. It can be called the monarch with the most descendants in the continent of Aslante one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is definitely no one in the human world who can stand shoulder to shoulder with him, and the elves, dwarves, giants, berserkers with lower fertility...all of them are incomparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that only those races that have one litter at a time can compete with Emperor Meng in terms of the number of offspring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, more than 90% of them are strange races with varying combat effectiveness, otherwise, other races in the mainland would not be able to mix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there were only a few dozen races in the Orc Empire at the beginning, and later because of various hybrids, a bunch of messy races appeared one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even scholars who specialize in the study of races can't figure out how many races there are in the orc empire. After all, although Prince Alex's kind of strange and alternative species that is keen on creating races is rare, a few are still born occasionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the experts and scholars are, the speed of researching new races cannot keep up with the speed of their creation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the human world is much simpler. Even if it is a cross-race combination, the birth is half-elf, half-orc, half... The probability of creating a new race is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it, I feel... Forget it, these extravagant and lustful things are not something a small nobleman should think about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the inefficient land reclamation team, Hudson was secretly worried. According to the current efficiency, it is estimated that the Lord of Dawn does not know when he will be able to develop the Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is a huge swamp on the other side of the mountain range. Going all the way along the swamp, it is not clear exactly where it will go, but Hudson guesses that the end of the swamp may be the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. The southeast province is originally a coastal province, and the swampland that divides the border with neighboring countries is not surprising that it can extend all the way to the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not included in the territory of the two countries. In addition to the special local terrain, it is most likely because everyone is too busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha is facing the threat of orcs all the year round. Ignoring the daily small-scale conflicts for the time being, the orc empire will definitely launch a southward invasion in as short as ten or twenty years, and as long as 70 or 80 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scale of the war has no logic at all. Even if it is just a medium-scale invasion, it will cause the Alpha Kingdom's vitality to be severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Salam Mountains were not developed, and a large part of the reason was caused by the war. After all, after every population boom, what greeted them was war, and there was no time to play with population overflow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Wright County where Hudson is located, it was only developed more than 300 years ago, and the time it was actually developed was only more than 100 years ago. Some young villages may have been opened up twenty or thirty years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small and medium-sized nobles have limited strength. Given the choice, no one would abandon the plains and go to develop hilly areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't want to touch the hills, and no one cares about the swamp behind the hills. With the investment in developing this swamp, it is better to dig deep into the potential of our own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, not everyone is like Hudson, who set himself a grand strategic goal from the very beginning. It is difficult for most small and medium nobles to have a clear development plan, and most of the time they follow their neighbors to learn from each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other side of the swamp, it can be seen from the continental map that it is the Kingdom of Blackstone, and there are obvious lines on the border marked with four large characters - \"Hessen Mountains\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the specific situation, Hudson does not know. Anyway, there are markings on the map of the mainland, and it is said that there are monsters infesting, so it shouldn't be a small bag like the Salam Mountains, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the scale of the swamp, you can tell that it is not the accumulated water produced by small soil bags like the Salam Mountains that can be washed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't go on like this, even if there is no competitor on the opposite side, you can't waste time like this. In case the orcs really came over one day, there would be no time for farming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at a group of security chiefs who were summoned, gathered together in twos and threes to discuss, Hudson said angrily: \"Why do you have a good chat?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happy things can't be enjoyed alone, shouldn't your lord be happy too?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your wasteland reclamation progress can be as efficient, I will be very happy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him frightened all the security chiefs. Although they hang up an official position, they are actually ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only preferential treatment is to increase the monthly ration by ten pounds. The privileges and the like are too short to breed for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bureaucracy, even if they want to learn, no one in the territory can teach them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nonsense, I won't say much. Starting today, we will divide an area with Bao as the unit, and carry out land reclamation separately, and evaluate once a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the five best-performing guarantees, the meat supply of all people will increase by 1 pound per month, and the supply of miscellaneous grains will increase by 5 pounds. Among them, the best performer, the reward will be doubled directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five worst-performing guarantors, the guarantor himself gave me an explanation. If there is no reasonable explanation, the head of the security will be dismissed, and the ration supply of all the members of the security will be reduced by 5 pounds per month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Later, livestock and agricultural tools will be divided in units of insurance. I don't care how you allocate internally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I only look at the final result. If anyone dares to hold me back in the land reclamation, I will break his leg first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficiency of grinding foreign workers is really too low, so we must find a way to make the people below roll up. Otherwise, how could he achieve the noble life that Master Hudson dreamed of?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, direct distribution of production to households can most improve production enthusiasm. It is a pity that things that are deviant and challenge the rules of the game often do not end well when they set a precedent in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an orthodox aristocrat, Hudson does not want to be an alternative in the eyes of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are too many people who don't like him, if he is sued to the capital for not fulfilling the lord's obligations, and the king directly revokes his status as a noble lord, it will be completely cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't doubt that such martyrs have already appeared. In the process of historical development, all kinds of wonderful things will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many things do not need to discuss the essence of right and wrong, as long as people around you think you are wrong, then you must be wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to argue, because one person can never change the cognition of a group of people. Perhaps one day in the future, this matter will be re-defined more objectively, but you must not see what violates the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in the process of land reclamation, teamwork is even more needed. It is enough to let the people below roll up, there is no need to put yourself into the vortex of the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to play with the family responsibility system, it is estimated that the most resistant person is the leader. If you hang out with the lord, although your life may not be good, you will definitely have less troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have enough personal freedom, but I don't need to worry about everything from birth to death. Even if there is a famine, the lord is responsible for carrying it around. Anyway, they can't let them starve to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Eastern Dynasty in the previous life, the folk clans are powerful, they can unite clans as a unit to resist risks together, and have the basis for reforming the feudal system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serfs who have not formed a clan, if they come out and work alone, I don't know if their life will be better. Anyway, the ability to resist risks is almost zero. Any disaster can take away everything they have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord's decision cannot be changed, and the good mood of the guards who didn't want to break their legs disappeared in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that if I became the chief security officer and won the trust of the lord, I would be able to live a happy life and reach the pinnacle of life from then on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that there are no pies that fall for nothing in this world. It is simply impossible to just take the benefits and not do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dares to ignore Hudson's warning. The aristocrats said they would break their legs, but they would really break their legs. No one thought that one of their legs could be as important as the reputation of the aristocrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing his subordinates frowning, Hudson didn't have the heart to advise them. The more this kind of time, the more able to exercise a person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is a talent or a fool can be seen as soon as the follow-up land reclamation project starts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is trash, then kick it down as soon as possible. In the entrepreneurial stage, the destructive power brought by a waste entering the management team is not a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At any rate, there are more than 20,000 people in the territory. Slowly screening, you can always find potential stocks suitable for cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Collar, watching the neighbor next door enthusiastically playing land reclamation, Baron Kettley almost drools with envy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously everyone started their business together, but as a result, other people's territories have entered the fast lane of rapid development, while their own family is still running wildly on the road of making ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley has completely sneered at the statement that \"Southern Xinjiang is rich, and the ground is full of gold. If you just sprinkle some seeds, you can get a big harvest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is indeed rich, and his own territory is indeed fertile, but these do not mean that he is rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make a fortune, you must at least develop the territory first. With the current development status of Maple Leaf Collar, it is difficult to maintain the balance of income and expenditure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, where is the slave sent by the family, and how long will it take to arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient labor force has become the most critical factor restricting the development of Maple Leaf Collar. Under the background of not being able to get enough livestock and serfs, he could only make orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Counting the days, it should be about to enter the border of the southeast province now, and it will be sent to the territory after ten days and a half at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just Kettler, these orc slaves are not so easy to manage. Without some training, it is difficult to make them obedient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, the slaves sent by the family this time are as many as dozens of races, and language communication alone is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the convenience of management, we must screen out the races suitable for farming as soon as possible, and find a way to deal with the rest! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a knight who came down from the battlefield, the most indispensable thing is to kill decisively. The conflict between the human race and the orcs has long been irreconcilable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having a large number of orc slaves in the territory is a high-risk thing in itself. Even if the lord is not afraid of these guys making trouble, the serfs below can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of turmoil, the Maple Leaf collar, which is already struggling to make ends meet, will get even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Holman. The extra slaves will not be wasted. If we can't use them, it doesn't mean the neighbors can't use them either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc slaves are indeed mostly horribly stupid, and they can mess up even the simplest things. But it is still possible to do some purely physical work that does not require brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are some suspicions of supporting the enemy in doing this, we don't do this kind of thing, and other people will do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Maple Leaf Territory has been short-lived for a long time, and the territories of other nobles are similar. In the two counties of Wright and Wyton, except for the rich and powerful mountain territories, almost all the territories are unable to make ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those local nobles are okay, the autumn plowing is finally completed, as long as they support the past few months, they can almost maintain the balance in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they can reduce expenses, give up unnecessary interpersonal expenses, and reduce their daily living standards. After a maximum of one or two years, you will be able to turn losses into profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we are different. The army is the foundation for us to go south, but it is also a mountain that weighs on our heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no military subsidy from the kingdom, no smuggling business to do, no objects to plunder, and only relying on the output of the territory, the pressure to feed so many soldiers is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But before the local nobles officially accept us, it is impossible not to maintain so many troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the territory cannot be developed as soon as possible, my savings will not last long. Even if I know that selling a slave to a mountain baron is a cup of poison with honey, I can only drink it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the finances will collapse before the territory fully resumes production, and it will be all over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not in charge of the family, you don't know the difficulty of the lord. Before the war, the Maple Leaf collar was rich in products and fat; but a war destroyed all of this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the same is to raise soldiers, a mature territory, and a semi-disabled territory, the cost of raising soldiers is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mature territory can be self-sufficient in food, cloth, meat, oil, etc. Even if the weapons and equipment are broken, they can repair them by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main expenditure of the lord to raise soldiers is to buy salt, update and replace weapons and equipment, and war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serf soldiers do not need to pay military salaries. Even if they are elites composed of practitioners, the lords only need to pay some subsidies in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to use coins or distribute food, cloth, and meat products depends on the mood of the lord, and the soldiers will not be picky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivate the fields during the busy farming period, and practice during the slack period. As long as there is no war, military spending can usually be maintained at a low figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Southern nobles like to cultivate cultivator guards, which is mainly determined by their environment. Generally speaking, the world is peaceful, and conflicts are mostly regional armed brawls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guard team composed of practitioners is obviously more dominant in daily fights. What's more, they want to imitate the northern Xinjiang nobles to train the army, and the small nobles do not have such conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In daily fights, only brave and ruthless fighters can be cultivated, while ordinary sergeants cannot become elites without experiencing fighting on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Battles like the suppression of the Skull and Bones rebellion are rarely seen in decades in the southeastern provinces, and it depends entirely on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, the cult rebellion was suppressed by the lord himself with his guards, and there were very few people who could make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although noble lords often engage in fights, they cannot fight each other to the death. The intensity of the conflict can only be regarded as an armed conflict, far less than a real war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After meeting the daily needs of armaments, most nobles in southern Xinjiang like to spend money on daily life, training younger generations and maintaining personal connections. There is also a contingency reserve if you have the means to spare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the different levels of investment in cultivation resources, even if they seldom go to the battlefield, the personal force of the southern aristocratic children is generally no worse than that of the northern Xinjiang aristocratic children. After all, actual combat ability can also be compensated by realm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production of the Maple Leaf Collar has not yet recovered, but it is in the embarrassing stage of transition from the northern nobility to the southern nobility. Baron Kettley's life is naturally sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to keep the territory's finances from going bankrupt and get through this lean period, he had to temporarily give up the resentment in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, it's best for you to think like this. In the world of nobles, there are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if you have noticed that the military strength of the southeastern native nobles in Wright and Wyton counties is constantly increasing, while the military strength of us northern nobles is constantly being weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Maple Leaf collar as an example, the 300 private troops who went south with us, because of the non-combat attrition caused by the previous battle and acclimatization, there are now 278 people left, which is almost a fifteenth reduction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other territories, although there is no detailed data, it is estimated that they are not much better. Some guys who love to toss may lose more than one-tenth of their staff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, we can still suppress a group of local nobles, but as time goes by, the strength of the two sides will still be gradually drawn closer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we cannot properly handle the relationship with our neighbors, our life will be very sad in the future, and we may even be excluded. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the reminder from Holman, Baron Kettley's expression became more serious. Although he also found that something was wrong, he didn't expect the problem to be so serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the battle between the nobles, winning is the long-term future, and a temporary win or loss does not mean anything. Only the winner who survives to the end is the real winner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't beat the other party to death with a stick, so if you can't form a deadly feud, it's best not to form a deadly feud; the grievances that can be resolved must be resolved as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes turning an enemy into a friend is also a strategic victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that selling slaves to neighbors was just to make up for the financial deficit, but now it seems that this is not only a business, but also a starting point for breaking the ice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how other noble lords of northern Xinjiang choose, there is no choice for the Maple Leaf leader anyway. The neighbors are too powerful, there is really no chance of winning if they are reckless, and the only one who will suffer if they continue to be hostile can only be themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a real grudge, you can keep it in your heart first, and then slowly settle it when you have an opportunity later. If there is no chance, just keep it in your heart. Kettley is not the master of the city without a plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, thank you for your reminder, I know what to do next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can sell us the means of production of iron products for profit, why can't I sell slaves to these southern Xinjiang nobles for profit?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This business must not only be done, but also must be made a lot of money. Send someone to find out which families are transporting slaves to the south. If they don't need that much, try to find a way to take them over at a low price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the best example. If you want to earn more, you can only make your business a monopoly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is now winter, and it is impossible to go deep into the orc empire to catch slaves in the short term. Even if they recover after the beginning of spring, sending the slaves over will be a matter of next summer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that in the next half a year, this group of slaves will be the only orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I hope that the number of slaves transported by each family will not be too many this time, otherwise our family will not be able to eat, and this business will not be easy to do! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 108": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 108: One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 108 One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Salam Mountains, looking at the busy land reclamation crowd from a distance, Master Hudson nodded in satisfaction, and the cub squatting on his shoulders also followed suit with great interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The progress of land reclamation has greatly increased, and the plan to reclaim 20,000 mu of land before spring plowing has a high probability of being overfulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His subordinates are working so hard, and Lord Hudson, as the lord, is naturally very happy. It just made him wonder why the cub was so excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inquiry, it is Mr. Bear Stearns who is happy; further questioning, it is that Uncle Xiong likes it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, the brat can't guess what's on his mind. A guy who can be alone for several days with just a small gadget, obviously cannot be judged according to the thinking of normal people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The limits of people are not forced out. Since Hudson ordered to divide the area into units of security to open up wasteland independently, the following security groups quickly followed suit and divided the tasks into each group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One level suppresses one level. In this respect, it seems that everyone is self-taught, and the task is quickly disassembled and passed to the lowest level. The more clearly the task is down to the lowest level, the harder it is to be lazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are ten households in one family, and they know each other very well. Everyone knows who is what.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was about rations. Everyone stared at each other. It was clear at a glance who did more work and who did less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't get advanced and get the reward from the lord, you can't be punished at the bottom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chief security officer at the top was afraid of being punished, the chief armorer in the middle was also afraid, and the serfs at the bottom were even more afraid. The taste of long-term hunger, as long as you experience it once, no one wants to try it for the second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to only cut five pounds of ration supply per month, but it is actually a change from barely full to hungry. Even if it adds another five pounds, everyone can still eat clean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of insufficient oil and water, everyone is a big eater. It seems that the young and strong have a daily supply of 1.5 pounds of grain, but in fact two-thirds of it is miscellaneous grains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is stingy, but that the living standards of serfs are like this these days. A lord with sufficient supplies like him is already the conscience of the lord's world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want more food, you can only do more work. For example: the daily supply of miners and blacksmiths in mines is 1.8 pounds, and other non-staple foods are also higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are skilled masters and soldiers, not only the daily ration supply has reached two pounds, but the proportion of staple food has also increased from one-third to two-thirds, and there is even a small amount of wheat supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the initial ration supply, it has now increased too much. After all, in the beginning, less people distributed cooked food, which seemed to be more in quantity, but in fact the food would expand during the cooking process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After adding some wild vegetables and leaves to one pound of rye, it is easy to make two pounds of rye bread. Three pounds of rye bread would not be impossible to make if more ingredients were added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other miscellaneous grains are slightly worse, but they are all used to fill the stomach, so there is nothing to be picky about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulties are temporary. Now the supply of oil and meat is tight, mainly because the breeding and planting industries have not developed. The meat brought by hunting alone is naturally a drop in the bucket in front of a five-figure population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expansion speed of the aquaculture industry is limited, but the accelerated development of the planting industry is very simple. Now the newly reclaimed land, Hudson is ready to use it to grow soybeans, peanuts, flax...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the oil extraction process will be carried out, and it is estimated that starting next year, the oil supply in the territory will improve significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, just watch from the sidelines. Speaking of the experience of opening up wasteland, the serfs at work are more experienced than Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farm tools and livestock are all equipped, and the task of the lord is completed. The rest of the work can be left to the serfs' free play. Anyway, Hudson only cares about the results in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Introduction is more productive, and it is now being proven. The unscrupulous Master Hudson is ready to expand and promote this experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Grain planting can also be divided into tasks, and then the output can be compared; the mine can also be grouped, and the output and scrap rate can be directly compared later...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A set of plans to guide his subordinates to involve is constantly taking shape in Hudson's mind, and it will be fully promoted in the territory as soon as the plan is perfected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, this month's iron production capacity data has been released. A total of 41 pairs of plate armor, 1,324 broadswords, and 1,300 hammers have been produced...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have followed your instructions and notified the nobles to come and receive the goods. It is estimated that half of the previous orders can be completed before the day of God's Descending, and the rest can be dispatched before the spring of next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, several new orders added recently have not been counted for the time being. According to your will, our production sequence has always followed the principle of first come, first served.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of newly added orders is not very large, and it can be completed in about half a month. If there are no accidents, the production task pressure in the mining area will gradually drop after the spring of next year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the old housekeeper made Hudson look serious. It is not a good thing that the pressure of production tasks has dropped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although redundant miners can be sent to land reclamation without wasting labor, land reclamation is a long-term investment, and it is difficult to see benefits in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the development of this situation, the income of the territory next year will inevitably drop significantly. For the heavily indebted Lord Hudson, lower earnings are undoubtedly dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although creditors will not come to collect collections for a while, borrowing with money and borrowing without money are two completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation tends to be stable, and there will be no more explosive market prices. Next, our own products must also be transformed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arms business cannot be given up, but the proportion must be reduced. The main reason is that its own strength is too weak, and it can only spin around in the low-end market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The market for serf soldiers seems huge, but in fact there are only a few nobles who are willing to pay the bill. Most of the orders were placed after they felt the danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the distribution of customers, we can see that the aristocrats of Wright and Wyton Counties, who are not rich in pockets, contributed 70% of the weapons orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Skeleton Society's toss in Arbor County, which frightened the local nobles to rush to strengthen their military strength, this ratio would be even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the sales of agricultural tools and daily necessities are more balanced. Generally speaking, the two counties of Wright and Wrighton are still the main ones, but this is mainly a matter of market development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the Skull and Bones rebellion, the Salam mining area stopped selling iron to the outside world. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the price of iron in the southeastern provinces began to skyrocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a doubling in the middle, and even if it fell back later, the price rose by 30% compared to before. Even so, the market is still out of stock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, direct purchase of finished iron products has gradually become a new choice for lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sit at home and wait for business to come to your door, and there are orders coming. If you take the initiative to distribute goods outside, the situation will only be better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to smoothly survive the decline in orders and the impact on the income of the territory, building a sales network and distributing goods throughout the province is undoubtedly the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that such a network is not so easy to build. Those who have a complete business network in the southeastern province are now selling salt from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How lucrative the profit is, Hudson does not know, anyway, the profit of any county is higher than the output of the entire mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, iron products can also be replaced by a series of tools such as bronze, pottery, wooden tools, etc., but salt is irreplaceable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the lord to the humblest slave, everyone needs salt. Not only do people have to eat it, but even livestock must be supplemented with a small amount of salt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    100% rigid-demand products plus monopoly operation, the final result will naturally generate huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sells iron products, and has to give discounts to big customers from time to time. The salt of the Dalton family never brings any profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only does it not give up profits, but it also often adds ingredients to the salt. The poor-quality coarse salt eaten by civilians is not only yellow in color, but also attaches such as sand, mud, and sawdust, etc. can be seen at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want high-quality table salt, there is no problem, just add money. Two silver coins a pound of refined salt, the color will be much better, not only the impurities are gone, even the color has become whiter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the price continues, one pound of magic salt for one gold coin, the appearance will be even better. It is said that the magic active factor is added, and after eating, it can slightly increase the affinity between oneself and magic elements, and has always been the favorite of mages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a pseudo-magician, Hudson can solemnly announce that these are false propaganda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, it can indeed improve the activity and affinity of elements, but that is when a large amount of food is consumed. If you can eat a few pounds of magic salt every day, it is estimated that you can increase the affinity by one or two, and it is only effective at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is how can salt be eaten in large quantities? Putting aside the issue of wallet injury, the body does not allow it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the IQ tax exists in every world. The only difference lies in the IQ tax on the continent of Aslante, which is only for the rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, with the wide distribution of Koslow family members, it is not difficult to establish a business network in China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that Hudson has always kept one truth in mind-not to do business with relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One or two transactions are fine, long-term business cooperation, interest friction is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not handled well once, not only will the business be damaged, but even relatives and friends will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatives and friends cannot be found, let alone other nobles. After all, this is a profitable business. If you give it to outsiders but not to your own people, what will your relatives and friends think?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if Hudson is willing to give up the bottom line, it will be very troublesome to find his own family to cooperate. Who made him have more relatives and friends?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is willing to join in a profitable business. No matter how you choose to give or not to whom, you will inevitably offend others in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to directly organize people to do it yourself. There is no doubt that playing direct sales in the feudal era is definitely challenging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Security is second, and the key lies in the staffing. With so many salespeople, they may deal with noble lords at any time, but not all cats and dogs are competent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, continue to organize production according to the plan. I will take care of other things.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For such a complicated event, there is no need to trouble the borrowed housekeeper. Identity determines position, if some information that should not be known is brought back, it will not be a good thing for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was immersed in the troubles of building a business network, Hudson still did not ignore the major changes in the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the Alpha Kingdom and the Holy See initially reached a settlement under the mediation of various countries. According to the information he inquired, Hudson directly summarized it in one sentence:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In the past, everyone will not hold each other accountable; in the future, everyone will go their own way, and no one should interfere with others.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such an agreement, whether the Alpha Kingdom will suffer or take advantage, Hudson, who has limited information, cannot make an accurate judgment for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is certain is: the two major forces will not fight in the near future, the peaceful years of the Alpha Kingdom can continue, and there is still time for farming in the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another big event, which is farther away than Hudson's life, but the impact is the most practical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Alex, under everyone's expectations, ascended to the position of Crown Prince of the Beamon Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really what everyone expects. Except for the fierce opposition within the Bimon Royal Court, everyone from the Orc Empire to the entire Alpha Kingdom is singing praises for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he came to power, Alex was a crown prince with such a strong appeal, and it was a historical precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good thing for all parties, including the mountainous land, that the Behemoth court ushered in a crown prince who spends his days and nights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, it is certain that after this man became the crown prince of Bimon, the balance of power between the main fighters and the main peace faction within the Orc Empire would not reverse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crown Prince\" does not only mean the heir, but also has great power and influence in the imperial court. Become the main combat faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is undoubtedly the best. The old Beamon the Great is unable to lead the army, and Crown Prince Alex, who is also in poor health, is also not the one who can lead the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neither of the two imperial court chiefs is suitable for leading the army, and the others are not of sufficient status to compete with the four imperial courts for leadership.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To start a war is to hand over the dominance of the orc empire. Driven by interests, it is difficult for the Bimon imperial court not to oppose the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether these two guys can persist for a few years, it is a rare farming time for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it's best to let these two guys live a long time...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's embarrassing. One of these two old guys is over 300 years old, and the other is almost 200 years old. It doesn't seem appropriate to talk about longevity based on their age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, Lord Hudson now needs them all alive to maintain the current structure of the orc empire. It is best to be able to live for more than ten or twenty years at a stretch, and extend the peaceful years to the development of the mountainous territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the backdrop of the two major events, it is nothing at all if a group of orc slaves went south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has never seen what an orc looks like, and wanted to see it, Hudson, who is rational online, finally held back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship with the nobles of Northern Xinjiang is very ordinary. It would be rude for them to come to watch the fun without an invitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, Baron Sith sent someone to invite you to participate in the commodity fair held in Dardir City next month.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the invitation card handed over by the servant, Hudson was also speechless. Is this giving pillows when you are sleepy, or is it a weasel giving a chicken a New Year greeting?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no direct conflict of interest, Hudson and Baron Sith are indeed hostile forces. The dispute that happened in Dadir City last time pushed both of them to the wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the Sith Baron was just having a hothead at the time, but the aristocratic world has no regrets to speak of. Once a choice is made, there must be consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City has a superior geographical location and convenient transportation. It has always been the commercial capital of the southern region of the Southeast Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any lord who takes root here and wants to make a fortune quickly must pay attention to business development. Being able to endure until now before taking action, Baron Sith can be considered calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just whether to support this field, but Hudson hesitated. Although he is now interested in what an orc slave looks like, he and the Sith Baron are hostile forces after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the representatives of the local nobles, Hudson has a lot of influence among the nobles of Wright and Wyton counties. Once a reaction is made, it will not only represent oneself, but also affect the choices of some local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, running to cheer for Baron Sith is undoubtedly endorsing the enemy. Even at a trade fair, it is possible to get a new order, and the one who will benefit the most is the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just by not participating, can you mess up this trade fair?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very skeptical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the two counties of Wright and Wyton, which are recovering, need a commodity trading place to provide transactions for the nobles in the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also wants to put the commodity trading venue on his own turf, if possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the mountainous area is too remote. Even the largest iron products production base in the southeast province does not have the possibility of becoming a commercial center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the relationship is, if you want to get customers to buy goods, you will have to travel a hundred miles, and no one will lose face!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already secretly scolded all his noble colleagues for being useless. The geographical location of Dardir City is indeed superior, but it does not mean that other people's territories are remote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, Dadir City was able to become the commercial center in the southern part of the province. The biggest reason was that the former lord was the most powerful nobleman in the southern region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the two counties, there are not a few areas that have the opportunity to compete with Dadir City for the commercial center. Although the reputation is not as loud as Dardir City, it does have the inherent conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, everyone is rebuilding now, and no one's foundation is much stronger than the other. As long as you plan carefully and are willing to spend money, you can definitely jump out and compete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether it is successful or not, as long as someone can jump out and do something, it is enough to cause a certain amount of trouble for that Sith Baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If force is insufficient, Master Hudson is willing to help stand on the platform. He is willing to provide all verbal support without involving his own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers, and the small Wright County is destined not to accommodate two mighty dragons. The strong rise of any one is bound to crowd out the political resources of the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Hudson is in a competitive relationship with Baron Sith. Especially in the last conflict, everyone directly put the contradiction on the bright side, so there is no need to talk about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the other nobles in the county, although each of them has a lot of ambitions, they are limited by their own strength and are simply unable to participate in the competition in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 109": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 109: involuntarily\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Looking at the hanging map, Hudson shook his head helplessly. Ambitious nobles are everywhere, but there are very few capable ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best positions in the two counties were taken by the nobles of northern Xinjiang. Although the Governor's Mansion made a wave of enclaves flying all over the sky to make trouble, it still failed to change this fact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the local nobles, the geographical location is slightly better, and they are still a few small nobles who inherited their ancestors. Whether the family business can be preserved is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that it was Hudson who supported them. Even if the local nobles in the two counties supported them together, they would not be able to compete with Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the world of nobles still depends on themselves after all, and the support of outsiders is only support, and cannot fundamentally change the gap in strength between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Baron Sith and the father of a grand duke. Although I don't know how much support there is, the 800 elite soldiers who followed southward are enough to dispel many people's minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson, after falling out with Baron Sith, did not rush to take action, because he was worried that the Grand Duke who was thousands of miles away would intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the status and strength gap between the two parties is too great, and they are not on the same level at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to push the flames secretly, and directly confront the conflict. What if the old guy doesn't abide by the rules and directly sends someone over to kill him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting on the Dalton family to succeed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accepted Earl Pierce's solicitation before, you can still look forward to it. Now, His Excellency the Governor did not retaliate against him, that is generous enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back on the smooth sailing of the previous development, Hudson gradually realized that something was wrong. It is the instinct of the big nobles to suppress the rise of the small and medium nobles within their own sphere of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory is developing so rapidly, and everyone can see the rising trend. The Dalton family did not respond at all, which is obviously unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the Sith Baron who was in the limelight, Hudson instantly understood. The smooth development of the relationship before, still delayed the great fortune of this uncle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Governor's Mansion has used many small tricks, it is far from enough to squeeze out the noble children of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Dalton family could take action against them, then Earl Pierce would not have intervened in the dispute between the two counties so early. You only need to watch the situation escalate, and after ten or eight nobles die, come out to clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the tense situation in the mainland before, can those old guys still see that both sides are bluffing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a turmoil, with the strength of the Dalton family, the unstable factors can be eliminated before the chaos breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of continuing to fuel the flames, they took the opportunity to beat the Northland nobles to death. It is estimated that the families behind the Northland nobles exerted pressure, or made deals with the Dalton family in other ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not convenient to go out in person, and you don't want all the children of the northern nobles to take root in your back garden, so you need to put the chess pieces on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that all the children of the local nobles in the two counties are pawns of the Dalton family, and Hudson is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was in Dardir City last time, Earl Pierce did not shy away from provoking the relationship between Hudson and Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this step, Hudson secretly complained. Sure enough, the more you know, the more troubles you will encounter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he doesn't know anything, he can fight Baron Sith, mobilize all his connections and slowly get him down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are the eight hundred elites amazing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as a few more neighborhood disputes are provoked, it will soon become seven hundred, six hundred, five hundred...Continuously winning battles, but the strength in hand is constantly weakening, until one day the advantages are exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless his grand duke father is willing to invest continuously, Hudson has a way to slowly bleed Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now that he knows Earl Pierce's calculations, Hudson can no longer play like that. It is necessary to fight with Baron Sith, and it is necessary for this man to make a movement to attract the attention of the Dalton family and strive for a relaxed development environment for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to let the Dalton family think that the two sides are fighting evenly, and it is difficult to tell the winner for a while, or that they are at a slight disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is a stalemate, the Dalton family will think that everything is under control and will not rush to suppress the development of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell the messenger that I will bring people to attend on time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to attend the party, but not to cheer, but to spoil the situation in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it seems a bit petty, and the means are not clever enough, but as a small nobleman who needs to live, the means don't need to be too clever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes the means are too clever, which is also a sin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobles, if the family strength is weak and the personal ability is too strong, it will often suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Collar, with a large number of orc slaves going south, Baron Kettley really picked up a lot of bargains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Monopolizing the orc slave trade\" and becoming \"the largest orc slave trader in the southeastern provinces\"... Baron Kettley has achieved all these ambitious goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, things got awkward. It's okay for him to lead soldiers to fight, but it's embarrassing for him to do business. The group of warriors under him are obviously not suitable for business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he also participated in the smuggling trade when he was in the Northland, that kind of business was dominated by the family, and he was only the executor in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The goods between the Alpha Kingdom and the Orc Empire are all rare and in short supply in the local area, and they have been booked early, so there is no need to find a market at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that as long as they monopolized the supply of orc slaves, customers would come to them by themselves. Facts have proved that he is completely overthinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles and local nobles are completely in two circles. The news that Baron Kettley has a large number of orc slaves is only passed on in their inner circle. The outside world does not even know that he has become the largest slave trader in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news is delivered slowly, it is not unacceptable. As long as a few days pass, other nobles will still receive the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crux of the problem is that he sent someone to notify some nobles nearby, clearly telling them that he had a large number of orc slaves in his hands, but they replied to him with three words—\"Got it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This gang of **** southern border nobles, for the sake of their pitiful face, they don't even care about their own interests!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the labor force in their territory is insufficient, they don't know how to buy some slaves to supplement. Just wait, there will be times when they will regret it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Silently greeted all the local noble families, Baron Kettley found helplessly that the problem still needs to be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slaves are not other commodities, they can be sold for a long time, and these guys have to eat. With tens of thousands more mouths, just eating and drinking every day is a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in order to monopolize the slave trade, Baron Kettley has put down all his net worth, and relied on the guarantee provided by the family to owe a large amount of foreign debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are only funds left to maintain the operation of the territory. If these slaves cannot be sold in time, the territory will be declared bankrupt next month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How about it, Uncle Holman? Has anyone ever made an offer?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley asked expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to find a guy to take the lead in purchasing, he had to send the most trusted Holman knight around him. After all, the threshold for aristocratic gentlemen is very high. It is not the nobles who visit in the past, and it is estimated that they will not even see them in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, prepare for the worst!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally everyone was excited when they heard that there were cheap slaves for sale, but when they learned that we were selling orc slaves, all of them changed their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the orc slaves we gave away were returned by them. The reason is: it is possible to frighten the residents of the territory, and they need to be responsible to all the people of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it's not completely deserted. Several nobles are interested in fox girl, cat girl, rabbit girl, leopard girl... If the price is cheap, they said they can take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a nobleman who said that his family has a relationship in the Colosseum. If we have orcs from the five royal families for sale, he can help to contact them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Knight Holman's explanation, Baron Kettley almost vomited blood. No one wants free slaves, how annoying this orc is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only for fox girls, cat girls, rabbit girls, leopard girls... Is he the kind of extravagant and lustful nobleman who has no conscience?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were indeed some beauties of different races among the acquired slaves, they were used to build relationships and expand contacts, not to sell them individually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is sold separately, no matter how high the price is, a beauty from a foreign race will only cost a hundred and eighty gold coins at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the beauty of the alien race is a nobleman among the orcs, or a member of the five royal families, it is possible to sell at a higher price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the question is, are orc nobles so easy to catch? Even if the slave hunting team's interests are swayed, they must first guarantee their lives before returning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contacting the Colosseum is even more nonsense, arresting the orcs of the five royal families as slaves, I really think that the bureaucrats of the orc empire are all dead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, when everyone is engaged in smuggling or arresting a few slaves, there is no big commotion. That is because the protection fee has been paid in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you keep your eyes open and don't provoke the big shots of the orc empire, if you happen to meet the orc army, there is a 70% to 80% chance of getting out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone in the slave hunting team acts recklessly, offends people who shouldn't be provoked, or does something that shouldn't be done, which will trigger a backlash from the orcs, and the slave hunting team that went deep into the orc empire at the same time will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the most serious, and even more serious can even set off a military conflict on the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why, that Baron Hudson is not interested either? His mines require a lot of labor. These stupid orc slaves are the best consumables.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley asked struggling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst plan is to select beautiful women from all the slaves and sell them to the nobles, and then sell the races with stronger force value to the Colosseum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Select slaves who are easy to manage and good at farming from the remaining slaves, and keep them for their own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining **** slaves can only beg for help. Please ask the nobles who have made friends to help digest some for the sake of past friendship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really can't deal with it, then sell it with tears in your eyes. If it is dealt with at a low price to an unscrupulous mine owner, every penny of the return is worth one penny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of slaves purchased by Baron Kettley in bulk is very low. Theoretically speaking, as long as the operation is done properly, there is a high probability that the cost can still be recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you succeed, you will earn blood, if you fail, you will keep your capital. Even if there is a loss, it will not be too serious. Such a transaction is naturally worth betting everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan is beautiful, but the reality is indeed skinny. For a monopoly business to make money, there must be a prerequisite - rigid demand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc slaves are obviously not just-needed products. Even if some aristocrats are interested in beauties from other races, but that is optional consumption, and no one is interested in paying high prices to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Colosseum, there are only three or five in the entire southeastern province. Even if they are willing to open up the acquisition, it is estimated that they will eat a few hundred people at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This has to be related before it can be sold. After all, they have fixed partners, and they will not change easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most valuable slaves cannot be sold at a high price, and it is impossible to earn money through monopoly blood. Even the difficulty of repayment has increased several times in an instant. On the contrary, the probability of losing money began to rise sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I haven't seen Baron Hudson himself. However, according to his butler, their orders have dropped sharply recently, and they will slowly reduce production after the spring begins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Messages should be reliable. Mountain collar has received a lot of big orders this year, and the total number of products sold in just half a year exceeds 50,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the situation is stabilizing, the junk weapons they produce are worthless except cheap, and they will definitely not be sold in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just selling farm tools and daily necessities, next year's orders will definitely not compare with this year's. If the Baron of Hudson continues to insist on not selling iron, the reduction of mine production is inevitable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman replied helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he, a salesman, doesn't work hard, it's precisely because he works so hard that he even inquired about the production situation of the mountain collar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with knowing yourself and your enemy. It's a pity that he only contacted a housekeeper who was borrowed from abroad, not the real decision-maker in the mountainous territory, and the news he inquired about was naturally only on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wrong news directly led Holman Knight to make a misjudgment, thinking that Master Hudson, who had reduced production in the mine, had a sharp drop in demand for labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the mountainous territory is constantly opening up wasteland, the outside world still does not think that this situation can continue forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most people believe that Hudson spent all his money on land reclamation just to achieve food self-sufficiency in the territory and reduce the financial expenditure of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current population of the mountain territory, the land reclamation operation should be over after a year or two. To continue to invest, even if Hudson is willing, his wallet must be able to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serfs who work and serfs who don't work, the consumption is not at the same level. Especially for heavy physical work like land reclamation, the body can't sustain it without the supply of nutrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The output of the newly opened land is low. In the past few years, it was mainly land cultivation, and the land income must not be expected in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson can toss his life, that is because he has made a lot of money selling weapons this year. But this kind of profiteering business is rare, and the mine's income cannot continue to be so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After pondering for a long time, Baron Kettley, who had experienced a fierce ideological struggle, said slowly: \"Foreign beauties should not be sold for the time being, these are cash cows, and it is not worthwhile to sell them all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrange for a businessman to open a brothel in his name. The location is placed in the territory, attracting those nobles to come to seek pleasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to arrange restaurants, casinos, and arenas. Now that the territory is not financially rich, I can only postpone it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining slaves can be sold as much as they can sell now, and the funds should be withdrawn first as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to visit Baron Hudson personally. Although orc slaves are not very useful, they can also be used as coolies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountains are not all plains. So much land has been reclaimed, so we can't rely on the sky for food, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that our neighbors have already started planning water conservancy projects, which is a bigger project than land reclamation. There are not enough lives to fill it in, I am afraid it will not be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The work hasn't started yet, so I guess he's not ready to take his life to fill it. Although serfs were worthless, excessive wear and tear would damage the reputation of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From what I understand, that profiteer is a fame-seeking master, and he will never let himself bear the notoriety of cruelty and tyranny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, he will probably construct part of the project every year to extend the construction period and reduce casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now there are slaves that are cheap and can be tossed at will, and this guy will not refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it goes well, we still have a chance to keep the principal this time. Even if it is a real loss, it will not lose too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our neighbor is a profiteer, we have to admit that he still has a bottom line in his work. I have done so many businesses, and I have never pushed people to a dead end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the autumn plowing, he sold a lot of farm tools on credit. Although the price is a bit high, it still solves the urgent needs of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that except for me, the unlucky guy who was tricked more miserably, most of the people who have traded with him are still thinking about him secretly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Baron Kettley is very unwilling. But there is no way, the nobles in the southeastern province really have no love for orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the specific reason? There is a high probability that he was not forced to a corner. As local snakes, it is far easier to obtain serfs than outsiders like them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are better human serfs available, why buy uncertain orc slaves?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, the language barrier is a big problem. Unless Baron Kettley sells slaves, he also equips them with translators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is obviously impossible. There are many races of orcs. Apart from the group of weird shamans, who would dare to speak the language of all the races of orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot solve the pain points of users, so Baron Kettley was doomed to fail from the very beginning of this business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What makes him most unacceptable is the hard tossing, which is obviously in the process of capitalizing on the enemy. In the end, he still has to expect the competitor to be virtuous in order to keep the principal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, the swift and swift Baron Kettley straddled out directly. He couldn't continue to procrastinate. Every extra day of delay would consume tens of thousands of pounds of food. He really couldn't stand it.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 110": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 110: dig a hole\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, watching a group of strange creatures appearing in front of him, Hudson found that his common sense of biology was completely subverted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the official history of the continent of Aslante, there were no orcs in ancient times. Until a guy who claimed to be a beast **** was born out of nowhere, leading the beasts to evolve into intelligent races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, under the inspiration of the gods, the mouse evolved into a rat man, the lion evolved into a lion man, the eagle evolved into an eagle man, and the cheetah evolved into a leopard man...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second senior brother is more powerful, and has evolved Pig and Wild Boar respectively. The former inherited his laziness, and the latter inherited his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the monsters that have not evolved, they are stubborn and unrepentant creatures, all abandoned by the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this statement, which was strongly opposed by Bear Stearns. According to Cubs, these guys who wrote history are unscrupulous people, and they are all groundless fabrications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of orcs is completely the product of some intelligent races tossing about and **** with wild beasts. Among them, the human race contributed the most, followed by the dragon race, dwarves, giants... These races also participated, including some gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you insist on saying that there are no related races, it is estimated that the elves with serious cleanliness may not have participated in the creation of the race. Perhaps this is also the reason why elves and orcs have always disliked each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evidence is very simple: the overall quality of orcs is far behind that of Warcraft. Not only is the strength weakened, but the wisdom of most orcs is also inferior to that of Warcraft. Only the best among them can stand shoulder to shoulder with similar monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wisdom and strength are both declining, so we can't just evolve claws, right? Such an evolution is not so much an evolution as a degeneration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the persuasiveness of this evidence needs to be strengthened. After all, the direction of evolution is uncontrollable, and it is not surprising that there are a bunch of failed products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to the problem lies in the \"inspiration of the gods\". If a lot of failed products are evolved under the leadership of the gods, it is really unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the **** theory is easier for Hudson to accept. After all, Orcs are deeply polarized, with horribly high upper and lower limits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it has something to do with the ancestors who created them, then it makes sense. They are all hybrids, and races that have been contaminated with the blood of the gods are likely to be much stronger than those produced by ordinary intelligent races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some powerful races in the orc empire firmly claim that they are descendants of gods. In addition to the unified belief in beast gods, there are also a bunch of racial gods, or totems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality template is Prince Alex of the Orc Empire. As the contemporary race, he has contributed the most to the Lord, and he has produced many wonderful descendants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few talents that are passable, the rest are weak chicken races, at least compared to pure-blooded Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sons and grandchildren added together, Alex created the descendants of the two regiments by himself. If these hybrid creatures continue to hybridize with other creatures, no one knows how many new species will be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of new races also confirmed the feasibility of the \"hybrid theory\" from the side. At least a considerable part of the orc races are all mixed blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After carefully looking at it and satisfying his curiosity, Hudson resolutely stopped his thoughts of continuing to explore the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things, it is better not to know too much. If you accidentally uncover the dust-laden secret for a long time, will life be over?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't know if Baron Kettley is here today, what's the matter?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For no reason, he didn't believe that his good neighbor would come here to give gifts. What's more, this group of grotesque orcs in front of them is not suitable as a gift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a gift, it is also a fox girl, a rabbit girl, a cat girl, a leopard girl... These beauties from other races are more likely to gain the favor of their masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a thought. The price of alien beauties is not cheap, and they are often far more than human women in the slave market, usually starting with dozens of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the friendship between the two, the generous Master Hudson is only willing to give away ten iron pots, how could Kettley give away dozens of beauties from different races?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I heard that Baron Hudson has been busy opening up wasteland recently. It just so happens that I have a batch of cheap and easy-to-use orc slaves in my hands. If you are interested, you can transfer them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler said straight to the point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the first time the two have done business, and he is very aware of Hudson's feces. If he didn't get straight to the point, the profiteer in front of him would be able to accompany him around for a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the idea that the sooner he strikes, the sooner he will be relieved, Baron Kettley really doesn't want to keep a large group of orc slaves in the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the group of orc slaves again, Hudson admitted that he was indeed tempted. Land reclamation is very manpower-intensive. Now the hilly area is fine, but once the tentacles are extended to the swamp area, it will be the hardest hit area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, there are countless strange creatures and dangerous places. No one knows what dangers will lie in the mysterious swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there were no such dangers, the price to be paid for developing the swamp would not be small. Without enough human lives to fill it, there would be no results at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no risk at all, the fertile swamp has already been occupied by people, how can Hudson get his turn?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson didn't believe it, and no one found the swamp outside his own territory. Even ordinary aristocrats wouldn't run around, and it's understandable if they didn't find out, but the griffin cavalry flying in the sky wouldn't be ignorant, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Filling it with your own serfs is very damaging to prestige. Once the casualties exceed the tolerance limit, the serfs will also make a fuss, which may cause a big scandal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, using orc slaves does not have such troubles. No matter how heavy the casualties are, the outside world will not pay attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson asked tentatively: \"Your Excellency needs to make a trip in person. I think there should be a lot of slaves here, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is purchasing orc slaves, it is definitely meaningless if the quantity is too small, it will only increase the management cost of the territory; if the quantity is too large, Master Hudson's wallet will not be able to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, Baron Kettley didn't pick the right date for his visit this time, and chose the time when Lord Hudson was the poorest to sell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The number is not too much. All kinds of orc slaves add up to only 20,000 to 30,000 people, and I have to keep some for myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Wright and Wyton counties are seriously short of labor force, the number of slaves is nothing at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler pretended to be confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, as long as the price is cheap enough, more than 20,000 slaves are definitely not enough for the nobles in the two counties. If you want to satisfy everyone's appetite, adding a zero at the end is almost the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only premise is that \"beastman\" cannot be added in front of the slave, otherwise the situation will be reversed. In particular, these orcs were divided into dozens of races, which made sales even more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, congratulations to Baron Kettley for making a fortune. If the price is right, I will keep the tauren and kobold.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether orcs are easy to use, he doesn't know. However, he has heard some stories and legends. Kobolds are good at digging holes and can be used for mining;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other races, Master Hudson said: either they look too rough, or they are not familiar with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pockets are not rich, in order to avoid pitfalls, it is better not to touch them. After all, the Baron Kettley in front of him really doesn't look like a fuel-efficient lamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Changed to someone else, and he was tricked in the transaction, and it is estimated that he will never come to the door. It doesn't look like this guy is able to maintain his sanity all the time, as if he is not affected by the previous transaction at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Baron Hudson. These slaves are not only sold, they can only be purchased in combination, and the number of purchases at a time must not be less than 10,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the quantity purchased is large enough, you can also get a discount. If you can buy it in a package, you can even get 30% off wholesale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that my communication skills are too weak, and I have no friendship with most of the nobles in the two counties, so I am embarrassed to come to sell. Otherwise, I would not find you for wholesale sales. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley replied pretending to be helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all learned from Hudson. High-quality slaves and low-quality slaves were mixed and sold, so as not to sell out the good ones and throw all the rest in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to convince Hudson that he was really tearing up the sale, he even did not hesitate to expose his shortcomings and bluntly said that he had a bad relationship with the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the result is doomed to disappoint him. After the poor Mr. Hudson heard that it was packaged and sold, he didn't even have the courage to ask the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the risk of capturing slaves from the Orc Empire, and sending them over thousands of miles, and changing hands many times along the way, the cost can still be roughly estimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't earn multiple times the profit, who will be a notorious slave trader if you are full? Even if it is really cheap to sell, where can it be cheap?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the price is only one-third of that of a human slave, Hudson, who is heavily in debt, can't afford it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if secondary distribution is possible, Hudson will not advance funds to do this high-risk transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, slaves were meant to eat. In case the market conditions are not good, a large backlog of slaves will end up in their own hands, and daily consumption can overwhelm people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since this is the case, then we can only look forward to the next cooperation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson finished speaking, Baron Kettley's expression turned ugly instantly. The only person in the two counties who could eat these slaves stopped playing. Isn't this killing him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Baron, don't refuse in such a hurry, you might as well listen to my quotation first, the price is definitely an unexpected discount. If you sell 24,000 slaves in a package, you only need to pay 55,000 gold coins...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for Baron Kettley to finish speaking, Hudson turned his head directly. The orc slaves who can walk out from the northern border are definitely strong laborers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The average unit price is less than 2.5 gold coins, and the price is indeed unimaginably low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same price, if you want to buy a human slave, you will probably be beaten out by the slave trader directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the serfs exchanged by Hudson before, we know that the quantity is less than half of this. After adding a batch of livestock and grain, the total price is almost the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that serfs are based on the family unit, but the old, women, old and young are packed together to calculate the population, and less than half of them are young and strong men and women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a price, everyone is still making friends, and they didn't intentionally kill him. According to the current slave market in the market, the price can be even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there will be cheaper slaves in another time, but the current market price is like this. Don't think about buying slaves in the southeastern provinces where supply and demand are seriously out of balance at prices in troubled times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"With all due respect, Lord Kettley. The price you gave is indeed good, but a good price does not mean a good product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Language communication alone is a big problem. What's more, these slaves are all recently captured raw slaves, and the difficulty of management will increase greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is sold separately, few nobles will be interested, let alone packaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, Dadir City will hold a trade fair. Your Excellency should bring the slaves over there, and ask Baron Sith for help! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively gave a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was worrying about how to bring down Baron Sith, and now the opportunity came to my door. It is the first time to hold a trade fair, what is needed is to make a name, and a large number of unsalable products will not work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this huge orc slave is a hot potato. As for the difficulty of management, that is purely an excuse for Hudson to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the small number of soldiers led by Maple Leaf, so many slaves can be guarded. The rebellious ones inside had been dealt with long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how Baron Sith will deal with this trouble, it has nothing to do with Hudson. Anyway, no matter what the final outcome is, the seeds of contradictions can be sold within the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, to tell you the truth. The relationship between me and Baron Sith has not been very good, and the matter can be traced back to an outing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inconvenient to discuss the specific process. Anyway, our relationship has never been great. Not long ago, he wanted to sneak attack on your territory, but I refused. I count on him to help, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't judge the authenticity of Baron Kettley's misfortune. But one thing is certain, that is, Master Hudson really has no money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is 10,000 to 20,000 gold coins, he can still grit his teeth and take it out, but 30,000 to 40,000 gold coins have to be borrowed. No matter how much it is, it is estimated that it will be difficult to borrow money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was deeply in debt, and it was basically an open secret among native aristocratic circles. When it comes to money, even relatives and friends have to weigh his repayment ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since this is the case, your Excellency should go there. Presumably, you have received the invitation letter. It clearly states that we hope that we will bring the goods to do business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even everyone's daily expenses, our Sith Baron proudly stated that he would be responsible. More than 20,000 slaves eat, drink and scatter every day, which is not a small sum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency only needs to bring all the slaves there, and in a short time, Baron Sith will be more worried than you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson urged hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he deliberately made trouble, it's that Baron Sith is too arrogant. In order to win the reputation of Dardir City, they even dared to provide board and lodging for the participants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't you force Master Hudson to do bad things this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson was going to invite a group of nobles, bring more people to eat and drink for free, and make some troubles by the way, so that the governor hundreds of miles away can see his efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is an extra knife of Baron Kettler, it is even more necessary to support Baron Sith. Not only to cheer, but also to set the stage high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, reality finally defeated everything. Even though he knew it would be immoral to do so, Baron Kettley still gritted his teeth and nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, offending Baron Sith alone is better than offending a group of wealthy families in the North. They are all vicious slave traders. If you don't pay their debts, you can imagine how terrible the consequences will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, seeing the day of the event approaching day by day, Baron Sith always feels restless. His intuition told him that something bad was about to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he took stock of all the preparatory work, and made corresponding arrangements for all possible omissions, and he really couldn't find any problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After the group of local nobles received the invitation, what is their reaction now? Will they collectively boycott this event?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the Northland have agreed, even if they had a petty quarrel with him on weekdays, they expressed their full support this time. Then it can only be the local nobles who do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, before planning this operation, he also carried out a lot of public relations activities, attracting a group of local neutral nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the entire local aristocratic group, there are only a few who are willing to accept his solicitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, young master. According to the information we have collected, the local nobles have indeed joined forces, but they are not boycotting participation in this event, but to bring more people over to increase our logistical pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that it was the mountain baron who initiated this operation behind the scenes. It is estimated that they want to take advantage of the crowd and create chaos for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is from a small family, so he cannot avoid being petty in his actions. The event lasts only a few days, even if they have more people, how much will they add to our expenses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where we should be prepared, we have taken precautions. Including the northern nobles who are close to the young master, we will have more than 1,500 troops to maintain order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to make trouble, we can respond in time. As long as the commercial status of Dardir City is re-established, the current efforts can be doubled in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the opponent was at the gold level, but he didn't expect it to be bronze, which really made him lose interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City has obvious regional geographical advantages. It is unrealistic to prevent it from becoming a commercial center. The best way to deal with it is to find a way to delay time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, everyone not participating in the event and boycotting transactions in Dadir City is the best way to delay the spread of its influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once people come, even if they don't make a transaction, the influence will still be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Businessmen are the most sensitive group, and they have their own set of logic for judging market potential. As long as the reputation of Dardir City is established, countless businesses will naturally come to take root.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the merchants come and the goods are abundant, the market will develop. At that time, the nobles nearby will not be able to resist it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't go to other cities hundreds of miles away to make transactions just to take a gamble, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's the best, but we can't ignore the small actions of the local nobles, otherwise they will cause us a big mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the mountain baron, you must focus on it. To be able to manage the territory impressively is definitely not a reckless man who only knows how to fight and kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also the baron from the Dalton family, who is said to be about to graduate from the Academy of Magic. Although the location of his territory is not as good as Dardir City, it is also the heartland of Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the background behind him, there are definitely a lot of resources that can be mobilized. If you jump out and compete with us for the commercial center of the southern region, there will still be many supporters. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

All the local nobles who could drop by along the way gathered here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not to mention that the soldiers are strong and the horses are strong, but the large number of people shows a bit. Eating Baron Beatsis is a joke, but demonstrations in the past were real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the efforts of Hudson, the military strength of the local nobles in the two counties has undergone a round of skyrocketing in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although we don't know how much the specific strength and combat effectiveness have increased, the number of troops has indeed increased. If the previous conflict happened again, it would at least cause more casualties to the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that it is the slack season for farming. Except for a certain lord who is working hard to open up wasteland, the people under his command are still busy, and everyone else is free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Select the strongest serfs, pick up the most elite weapons, hold an armed parade to strengthen their courage, and boost the morale of the local nobles, which is also one of the main purposes of this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome everyone from afar, my baron has prepared a banquet, all distinguished guests are invited to join me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entourage, please follow the guidance of the soldiers and go to the camp in the south of the city. Dinner is also prepared over there, and everyone can enjoy it to their heart's content. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the trembling eyebrows of the old man, it can be seen that although he knew that there would be many people coming this time, he obviously did not expect that the local nobles would bring so many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't it mean that the southern aristocrats are the most particular about food? Even if they want to make trouble, they should restrain themselves on the surface. Why don't they play cards according to common sense this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before I had time to think about it, the moment I stopped at the gate of the city, several teams came from behind, as if they had made an appointment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, everyone brought a large group of people over, as if there were fewer people, and it seemed that they had no face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Repeated what he said just now, before he had time to take everyone away, another team arrived one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't doubt it anymore, now the old man can be sure that this group of local nobles arrived together at the appointed time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to know, people came to participate in the event after receiving invitations, so you can't turn people away, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To become a commercial center, super inclusiveness is a must. If you drive guests out of the door for no reason, your reputation will be bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in twos and threes greeted each other, but turned a deaf ear to the old man's words, as if they regarded him as air. The old man was so angry that he was furious, but reason kept him calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where's your Sith Baron? So many of us have come from afar, shouldn't his master come out to greet him?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's voice broke the atmosphere of the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson has never bothered to do this kind of deliberate finding of faults and hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that people are in the rivers and lakes, and they can't help themselves. Don't look at the local nobles present talking and laughing together, as if everyone is united. If you really want them to confront Baron Sith head-on, I'm afraid few will have the guts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that Hudson can easily become the team leader is enough to explain everyone's position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow the wave of the flag and shout, and it is no problem to help the venue when the wind is down. It would be too embarrassing for them to stand up against Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is arrogance in the heart, it has been almost consumed in the previous conflict. It can be said that the previous strong prestige of the northern Xinjiang nobles was still very successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current commotion is actually a bluff, and by the way, he cheers himself up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you are still so impatient! It's just that I came a little late, but I don't mean to disrespect everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there are too many guests here today, and I am really too busy, so I am a little late. Please forgive me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, all distinguished guests, please join me in the table! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you carry a gun with a stick, it will make the scene even more embarrassing. It can be seen that this Sith Baron is not a master who swallows his anger. Even if it was their own home court, they didn't save face for the \"guests\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the local nobles stopped and waited for Hudson's reaction, as if preparing to advance and retreat together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know that the Baron Sith is proud, and he won't be rude about these details. Since the Baron Sith is ready, then we don't have to be polite, let's do as we please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a huge team suddenly appeared in the sky. All kinds of orcs appeared, instantly attracting everyone's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is the southeast province. If this scene happened in the north, everyone would have to think it was an army of orcs attacking the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Sith, I am not late, am I? In order to support you, I brought all the best slaves here, and I am going to sell them for a good price with precious land.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley's words instantly ignited everyone's laughter. Everywhere you look, there are ratmen, piggies, goblins, and other garbage slaves, and they still say they are \"good\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of selling slaves, this humble baron has recently \"raised fame\" among the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just not a good reputation, but was crowned \"the stupidest slave trader\". Contempt is contempt, but it does not affect everyone watching jokes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to everyone's laughter, Baron Sith finally forcibly suppressed his anger. No matter what, you can't make trouble with your \"little brother\" in front of outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Baron Kettley never thought of him as his younger brother, as the boss introduced by the nobles who traveled south and north, Baron Sith had already acquiesced that these people were all his younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not too late, Ketley, it's great if you can come. Since you're here, let's take a seat together! Steward Faerun, arrange for someone to build a barracks in the west of the city to house these orc slaves.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, Baron Sith turned around and walked at the front of the team, as if he was leading the way for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he was really **** off this wave. It was no secret in noble circles that Baron Kettley's slaves were unsalable, and Baron Sith had also heard of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the bad luck of the guy with whom he had a feud, he secretly rejoiced more than once. You know, it was only a little bit short, and the title of \"stupidest slave trader\" fell to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the experienced old butler stopped him in time and carefully analyzed the sales prospect of orc slaves for him. As expected, it was still unsalable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I escaped the first day of junior high school, but failed to escape the fifteenth day. After all, this trouble fell on him in another way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, a group of local nobles were placed in the south of the city, and the children of the northern Xinjiang nobles were placed in the north of the city, separating the two sides to reduce conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan is very good, now there are a group of slaves, and a new city has to be divided out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether they can't live, but the gap between the status of slaves and nobles is too great. If they were placed together forcibly, the nobles who felt insulted would have to turn against him on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just this little trouble, he, Baron Sith, will admit it. There are only a few hundred barracks on the left and right, and they are all lowly slaves anyway. If you just circle around and deal with them, you can't waste a few pieces of wood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these guys are allowed to eat and drink for nothing for three days, they will lose tens of thousands of pounds of food at most, which Baron Sith can afford.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, things can't be that simple. In the huge commodity exchange meeting, more than 20,000 slaves participated in the transaction, and the last slave was not traded. Just think about how embarrassing the scene can be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this expensive event is publicized by the guests, it will directly become a farce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who eat melons don't care why the slaves are unsalable, they will only take it for granted that the commercial market in Dadir City is not good. At that time, it will be \"open your mouth to spread rumors, and lose your legs when you refute them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the biggest trouble was caused by the local nobles headed by Hudson, but they did not expect that the real trouble was being stabbed in the back by \"my family\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to invite God, but it is even more difficult to send God off!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of a group of local nobles, he couldn't refuse the entry of Baron Kettley's team. It is even more impossible to drive people away now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his mind on his mind, Sith was out of state throughout the banquet. After a few polite words, he left the banquet hall on the pretext of feeling unwell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, the situation is not good! Looking at Baron Kettley's actions, it seems to be a bit of a pinch. Maybe he really colluded with the local nobles and deliberately came here to cause sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, so many slaves fall into the hands. If it can't be dealt with in time, the finances led by Maple Leaf won't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the family behind him is willing to provide support, but to fill the hole of 40,000 to 50,000 gold coins at one time, I am afraid it will attract opposition from many clansmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now those who have financial resources and need to eat these slaves are only a group of local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driven by interests, it is not impossible for Baron Kettley to choose to betray. This situation must be contained, otherwise the consequences will be unpredictable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun analyzed solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign enemies on the side, and internal strife again, for Baron Sith, it is definitely a big event that the sky is about to fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Betrayal is something that people are most afraid of setting a precedent. Once Baron Kettley is won over by the local nobles, there will definitely be more nobles who will choose to defect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, for most of the northern Xinjiang aristocratic children who went south, the most important thing for them is to gain a firm foothold in the local area and leave a way for the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the northern Xinjiang nobles or the local nobles will be in charge of the two counties in the future, they are actually insignificant in terms of survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you have taken root in the local area for three generations and married the local nobles a few times, you are considered your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar cases have been staged long ago in history. Including the Koslow family also originated from the North, but now everyone regards them as local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single tree cannot make a forest. If the younger brothers turn against each other, no matter how powerful he is, he will not be able to resist the general trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention that he is competing for the dominance of the two counties, and if he can not be squeezed out from the local area, it is his means!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'll talk to Baron Kettley, and if it doesn't work, I'll find a way to get everyone to pool a sum of money and lend him an emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for these slaves, help digest as much as they can!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you push people into a hurry, with this guy's style, betray us as traitors, he can really do it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he decided to help, but deep down he was already thinking about how to find a chance to get rid of Baron Kettley's shit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are horizontal are afraid of being stunned, and those who are stunned are afraid of dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Baron Kettley was forced to a dead end, and directly played the broken pot. Either help him out, or he'll drag everyone to hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Baron Sith promised to help store the goods. If the slaves in his hands cannot be disposed of for a long time, Kettley will be able to put more than 20,000 slaves here for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Baron Sith can let go of his previous plan, don't set up any commercial center, and hand over the geographical advantages of Dardir City to others. Otherwise, he would have to deal with this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the banquet hall, there is no host, and everyone's enthusiasm will not be affected at all. In particular, the singing and dancing full of exotic customs attracted the attention of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles even made requests to Baron Kettley to buy exotic beauties in front of him. It's just that in the end everyone was scared back by Keitele's conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is okay to buy alien beauties, but the prerequisite is that you must package and subscribe to a certain number of orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has experienced this kind of routine, but Hudson used to attach pots and pans and other daily necessities, so you won't suffer too much when you buy them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the orc slaves are different, everyone has no experience in raising this group of aliens. What if a slave riot occurs and these noble nobles are killed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the kingdom's hundreds of years of demonizing orc propaganda, in the deepest memory of many nobles, orcs are a group of super destructive and lunatics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much everyone is interested in beauties from other races, it is impossible to pack and buy a thousand for a woman and go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the gaffes of his colleagues, Hudson is much calmer. Isn't it just a hot dance? It's not like I haven't seen it before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the group of exotic beauties on the stage were indeed moving, his reason told him that he must remain reserved now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only Hudson, but all the unmarried noble children are trying to restrain their emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because others can be crazy doesn't mean they can be crazy too. If you lose your temper during the banquet and fall into the eyes of a group of people who may be the future father-in-law, it will be a big penalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the reputation of being greedy and lustful, it is almost impossible to find an ideal marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the noble children are restrained before marriage, and mess around after marriage. Including those noble ladies are no exception, very few people have **** before marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the couple's life after marriage is not harmonious, and the husband's family is not strong enough, then it is easy to have a green prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of fun, so the husband and wife can play separately, and no one will affect the other. In some areas with an open atmosphere, it is even possible to hold an open meeting to have fun together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching an old guy walk onto the stage without any scruples and flirt with those interracial beauties, Hudson silently chose his side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't stay here any longer, it's someone else's territory after all, if I accidentally get tricked and someone arranges an affair, it's hard to tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone observes carefully, he will find that Hudson will shake his sleeve near his sleeve every time he drinks or eats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For no other reason, he brought a master poison detector with him. The mini version of the bear is printed on the clothes like a pattern, and it is actually a cub that follows closely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous growth of strength, Bear Stearns has also unlocked many abilities. Whether it is transformation or poison recognition, it is one of its talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price, all the energy in Hudson's mysterious compass is exhausted. Now, one thousand gold coins of magic crystals have to be purchased every month to replenish energy for the compass, so as to guarantee the daily practice of one person and one bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that this was just the beginning. With the absorption capacity of a bear with a big stomach, the demand for energy will be even greater in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson was smart enough to arrange for himself the status of a magician in advance, which reasonably occupied the magic spar exchange quota of many relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave is free, and you won't be able to use it anyway, so just support the children of outstanding families. The quota was given to Hudson, but he still had to pay for the gold coins himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that Hudson has never figured out the specific strength of the cub. Anyway, according to Bear Stearns, the nobles around him are not enough to slap Mr. Xiong in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The division of specific strength levels is the product of human beings' refinement based on their own understanding and needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Earth Bear family never engage in those boring things, only the three stages of infancy, growth, and adulthood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength span of each stage is also very different. Because according to the understanding of the Earth Bear, combat power can usually be judged by looking at the size.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the cub is obviously an outlier. Although his strength is gradually rising, and his talent and supernatural powers are constantly being unlocked, but judging from his size, he is still in his infancy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Bear Stearns didn't cover up and showed his real body directly, anyone who saw it would probably think it was an unweaned brat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that it has not been weaned. Honey + animal milk has always been its necessary food, and it has to drink a pot of the same volume as its body every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be the lifeblood of Xiongsheng, whoever dares to wean it will be in a hurry with whoever. If this situation continues, it is estimated that Hudson will not see the bear weaned in his lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told Hudson that it was time to find a way to make money. You can't ignore your essential work just because you want to play against Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The cries of merchants can be heard endlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prosperous Dadir city in the past seems to be back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Baron Sith has done his homework. Among other things, it takes a lot of effort for a merchant like Guanghui.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like all the local nobles, Hudson only sees but does not buy. This is what everyone agreed in advance, no matter what products appear in the city, they will not be traded this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the future, let's talk about it in due course. The memory of nobles also has a time limit. Although emotionally speaking, everyone does not want to see the nobles in the northern border grow bigger, but the southern region really needs a business center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several Dardir cities become business centers, which can bring enough benefits to everyone, and it is estimated that everyone will not refuse this convenience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the funders don't make a move, the transaction volume will naturally not increase. The contributions of just a few dozen northern nobles are far from enough to support a commercial center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any surprise, none of Baron Kettley's orc slaves were sold. Not only did the local nobles not buy it, but all the northern nobles did not take care of the business either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Baron Sith greeted everyone, it is a pity that all the nobles of the North have a large number of orc slaves. If they didn't know that they couldn't make a move, they might have to sell some of them to cash out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, orc slaves are really hard to use. Apart from some simple menial work, nothing else can be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the language barrier, and it is difficult to carry out the training smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not every territory has endless hard work. When the number of slaves exceeds the demand, the lords will naturally not continue to buy slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though everyone sympathizes with Baron Kettley's experience, it's only in words. It's a bit close to wanting them to support with real money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, it's not that everyone didn't help. A group of nobles from northern Xinjiang also collected a few thousand gold coins and lent them to Baron Kettley for emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As entrepreneurs, the money is squeezed out from between the teeth. Being able to do this is already quite interesting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, although everyone is a nobleman in the northern border, the land of the northern border is also extremely vast, and most of them have never socialized before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for a chance, let them go south together in a group, it is estimated that they would not even have the current relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, it seems that these slaves are no longer wanted. There is no point in keeping them except for wasting food. Find a chance to dispose of them!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith suggested sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reputation of slaughtering slaves is not good, you can always find a way to cover it up. If you keep supporting this group of idlers, your reputation will not be damaged, but your wallet can't stand it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just helping to raise him for two days, Baron Sith felt the pressure. If Baron Kettley stayed here for a long time, he couldn't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Sith, this is really cruel. Otherwise, wait and see, no one wants these slaves now, because it is now the slack season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After staying for two months, spring plowing begins, and lords who need labor may buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can rest assured that the daily expenses of the slaves will be taken as my loan from you. As long as these slaves are sold, I will return them as soon as possible. Baron Kettley said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who didn't know thought that he valued the life and death of the slaves in front of him, but he was actually just fighting for interests. Anyway, the slave is now being raised by Baron Sith, and his pressure has been greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can wait until the spring plowing and sell these slaves, you will make a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is only a possibility. No one can guarantee whether the local nobles will be short of labor during the spring plowing season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least during autumn plowing, people rely on the help of relatives and friends to complete the sowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During spring plowing, it is not impossible to borrow again. Most nobles will sell this kind of favor that has no risk and does not require much price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these slaves still cannot be sold until the spring plowing, then not only Baron Kettley will be finished, but even Baron Sith will go crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor ghosts are unable to pay back the money. More than 20,000 slaves eat, drink and scatter every day, which is not a small expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if calculated according to the daily expenditure of three copper coins per person, 25,000 people would have to spend 75,000 copper coins a day, which is equivalent to 50 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After two months, at least three thousand gold coins will be in vain. This is just the most basic expenses, the military expenses of guarding the slaves, has it not been included?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an accident, a slave riot or something, I don't know how much loss will be incurred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more troublesome is that all the money has been taken out, and the big trouble of orc slaves still hasn't been solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to return the goods. Slave traders these days do not have the option to return the goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the unlucky Baron Kettley will be chased by creditors all over the world in the future, but Baron Sith, who took over the slave Ray, will inevitably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, if you insist on keeping these slaves, then take them home and raise them yourself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slave traders are not welcome in Dadir City, I will immediately make a set of laws to prohibit slave trading here. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a lord, he has the right to make laws in his own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the creditors are not too big, Baron Kettley can also make his own laws to keep all the creditors out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Sith, I don't want to do this either. But there is no way. If I deal with these slaves now, all my investment will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement, my debt period is only half a year. If you can't repay the debt owed within half a year, you can imagine the consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can come forward and get the creditors to agree to postpone the debt collection, I will immediately follow your will!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it, then you have no choice but to let you go first. You can do whatever you want, anyway, I won't take them away. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said in a broken can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he offends Baron Sith to death, it is better than being hunted down by creditors. Among the two counties of Wright and Wyton, Baron Sith has the strongest family background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley couldn't find a better way than relying on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's impossible! You have too many debts, and I don't have that face. If you have the time, you might as well beg your father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Viscount Hank Cage is willing to come forward, maybe everyone will give you another chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Territory is fertile. As long as you work hard, you can still pay off your debts within five years. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more he said, the lower his voice, obviously Baron Sith didn't believe this nonsense himself. No matter how fertile the land in the Maple Leaf Territory, the territory still has expenses!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating income alone without considering the wealth accumulation model of expenditure is pure hooliganism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many territories that earn tens of thousands of gold coins, or even tens of thousands of gold coins a year, but there are very few territories that can still have a balance of tens of thousands of gold coins after spending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the Maple Leaf leader, even if Dardir City is managed, Baron Sith can't guarantee that he can have a balance of tens of thousands of gold coins every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the territorial income is simply calculated, the five giants in northern Xinjiang each occupy more than one province, and their annual income is worth millions of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be maintained because the great nobles have other industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the Sith Baron who wants to build Dadir City into a commercial center in the south. On the surface, it is for tax purposes, but in fact it is to gather popularity and develop its own industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying solely on that little tax, I am afraid that it is not enough for daily expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really makes money is renting/selling shops and houses in the city, as well as selling food, vegetables, meat and some daily necessities produced in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar gameplay, Maple Leaf collar can't copy. It's just enough to earn income from farming, and it's okay to live a small life with peace of mind. It's impossible to get rich all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe because he thought the idea was too bad, after a pause, Baron Sith added again: \"Maybe you can go talk to that mountain baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one of the two counties has the greatest demand for labor, that guy is the one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With that guy's appetite, even if the population of the territory exceeds 20,000, it still cannot meet his needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, you have dealt with him before, so just sell the slave to him at a discount. As long as the price is cheap enough, he will not dislike it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, it's better to lose some money than to keep procrastinating. You must know that every day of delay like this now will increase your loss by nearly a hundred gold coins. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the truth, although Sith does not want to befriend the enemy. But compared to smashing a hot potato into one's own hands, it's better to let the enemy off the hook.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this period of contact, he found that Hudson's strengths lie in military and territorial development, but he really doesn't see how strong his political skills are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, he will not give compliments to his competitors if he is translocated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since political means cannot keep up, the degree of danger is also reduced. There is nothing wrong with developing the territory, but it would be a big failure if you focus on the development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's useless, that guy is also heavily in debt now. For the development of the territory, that idiot invested all his money in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation is stable, the junk produced by that guy can no longer be sold, only some farm tools and daily necessities can be sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the iron products produced can be used to pay off debts, his situation is not much better than mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I invested more than 60,000 gold coins in these slaves. Even if they sell at a loss, do you think that **** is capable of buying them? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said pretending to be helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Baron Sith, he can't say anything good about Hudson. What's more, he didn't have a good impression of Hudson in the first place, and what he said now was from his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Got an unexpected answer, and the Sith Baron was mixed. It is undoubtedly a good thing that competitors have financial problems, but the tragedy is that the troubles seem to be irreversible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, what do you want?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's a stupid thing to ask me to settle your debts for you, then it goes without saying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person, you should know how big the basket you poke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The investment of more than 60,000 gold coins collected a pile of garbage. Even if some of the high-quality slaves can be sold, the loss this time will not be less than 50,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can bear such a huge financial loss for you. Even if the plan fails because of this, it is impossible for me to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For your sake, I have done my best. All the colleagues in Northern Xinjiang have a large backlog of slaves in their hands, and it is impossible to take your order. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, he would have liked to immediately kill this annoying guy in front of him. Compared with this guy, he suddenly felt that the \"Hudson\" who was hostile to him was as cute as a little white rabbit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Among the more than 60,000 gold coins, there are more than 50,000 in arrears, and these must be resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among these slaves, the high-quality slaves who can be sold can probably return 10,000 gold coins, and there is still a huge funding gap of 40,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can probably borrow 10,000 gold coins from relatives, friends, and family members in the Northland, and the family can also lend 10,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of colleagues also lent me several thousand gold coins. The weapons and equipment and war horses in my hands can also be cashed in thousands of gold coins. Now I only need 10,000 gold coins to tide over this difficulty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So I hope that your Excellency will be generous and lend me 10,000 gold coins to help me tide over this difficulty. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of holes dropped from 50,000 to 10,000, and Baron Sith's complexion improved a lot. Just whether to lend the money, he was still beating drums in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that things would definitely not be that simple. If Baron Kettley asked to borrow money in normal times, there was a high probability that he could borrow money from relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's different now, everyone knows that he lost a lot of money. Before borrowing money, one has to consider his ability to repay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What if you know you can't fill in the hole and run away with the money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have never happened in the continent of Aslante. Everyone can only admit that they are unlucky when they encounter it, and they can only think about the cross-border recovery of arrears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If I don't agree, don't you want to lead someone to **** the caravan?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out to rob without money is perfectly normal for the nobles of the Northland. At other times, Baron Sith would not mind his own business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just not right now, before the word of mouth of Dadir City has been erected, the big news of merchants being robbed came out, and the story behind it couldn't go on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we really want to get to that point, I have nothing to do.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley spread his hands and directly admitted that he had that plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding the extorted gold coins, Kettley knew that he had offended the Baron Sith to death, and it might be difficult for everyone to maintain their apparent friendship in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prepare the car, we are going to visit Baron Hudson.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, I'm afraid it's not good to go now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really immoral to visit his opponent just after receiving money from Baron Sith, and it's still on his territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't look for him, what will I do with the slaves in my hands? Is it really necessary to deal with them, and then bear a cruel name?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith can lend me 10,000 gold coins, which is already very interesting, and I can't push him into a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But even with the 10,000 gold coins, what should I use to fill the remaining big hole?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Holman, don't you think that at this time, someone is really willing to lend me money?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even within the family, if they knew the news, they would probably complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of embarrassing everyone, it is better not to say this at all, so as not to hurt feelings. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler said in a self-deprecating manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't ask to borrow money, you will never know how popular you are. The aristocrats who had a good relationship with each other this time took out two or three hundred gold coins to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, everyone will still support each other, but now they are only willing to lend such a small amount of money. Then it is even more difficult to let relatives and friends who are far away in the north and have difficulty in socializing in the future pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, what the nobles pay attention to is mutual benefit and reciprocity. You can't let others pay unilaterally and see nothing in return!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, who had seen through all this, did not complain, but chose to respond positively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in the last conversation, he was sure that Hudson was interested in these orc slaves. Although this buyer may not necessarily be rich, he is still a buyer after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After going around in a circle and cheating Baron Sith, the two appeared on the negotiating table again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hasn't changed much, but Baron Kettley's mentality has changed. The cruel reality told him that the personal connections he had previously managed were not reliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last negotiation, he still had some confidence. I thought that the worst outcome would be nothing more than a loss, and with the help of relatives and friends, at worst, the territory could be kept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is very embarrassing. If it weren't for the strict fiefdom system of the kingdom, there might still be people wishing him to go bankrupt so that he could come and take over the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, I'm telling you the truth. I'm indeed interested in these slaves, but the mountain leader is currently short of financial resources, and the cash he can use is at most 20,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the transaction is made at this price, you may suffer a lot this time. Taking advantage of the fire like this is not in line with chivalry, so I didn't make an offer last time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, Baron Kettley secretly complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A profiteer talks about \"chivalry\", which is very funny, but now he can't laugh at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only buyer has insufficient financial resources, and keeps saying that he will not take advantage of the fire to rob, so he should take the initiative to send it up for others to rob!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typically standing upright at the same time, unwilling to bear moral pressure. Later, it was spread that it was not Master Hudson who took advantage of the fire to rob, but Master Hudson who helped the poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for him, Baron Kettley, he is naturally a gold medal supporting actor who is too stupid to be saved. Who made him now have the title of \"the stupidest slave trader\"?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, 30,000 gold coins! As long as 30,000 gold coins, these slaves will be packaged and sold to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the matter has come to this point, I will no longer hide it. In order to buy these slaves, I paid 60,000 gold coins for the cost alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's on sale at 50% off, and I have to rely on debt to settle the final payment. If the price is lowered again, I can only go bankrupt in place. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that he should be the most failed businessman in the whole continent. Others bargaining is to earn more and earn less, but he is different, just to not go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, don't worry. Even if I raise 30,000 gold coins to trade, I'm afraid your life will not be easy in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Territory development is very expensive. No matter how good the foundation of the Maple Leaf collar is, it will be difficult to achieve a balance of payments in the first two years, and it will not work if there is not enough liquidity on hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why don't we change the way of cooperation, I will buy these slaves at the original price. It's just that cash is not used for settlement, but iron products produced in the territory are traded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You take these iron products to talk to the gang of slave traders. They are some agricultural tools and daily necessities. There will also be a large market in the Northland, so you don't have to worry about selling them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson encouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this time he really didn't intend to cheat. After all, you can't catch a sheep and keep rolling wool, or else the sheep will be bald, and there will be no need to roll it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a tool man, Baron Kettley overfulfilled the task this time. Not only did Baron Sith cheat, but also the northern nobles were divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be a pity to throw away such a valuable chess piece.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happened that the family needed to expand the market, so they simply took this as an opportunity to try it out. It would be best if the market in the Northland could be opened up, and it didn't matter if they couldn't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a high value-added product, the cost of a commodity worth 60,000 gold coins is less than 30,000 gold coins!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it does not sell locally or compete with itself for the market, Hudson does not mind hitting the outside market at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, I'm afraid this is a little difficult, right? Unlike the southeastern provinces, the iron products market in the Northland is actually monopolized, and foreign products cannot be squeezed in at all...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Baron Kettley could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Your Excellency, I've thought too much. Can't you sell it, and you're not allowed to use it yourself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't use it yourself, you can still sell it to the Beastman Empire, maybe you can earn more. As long as it is not sold in the Northland, it will be able to explain the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, it was the group of slave traders who were responsible for the sales. You just hand over the product to them, and what happens later has nothing to do with you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem, whoever sells is responsible. Even if it really offends the interests of local snakes, it is impossible for them to travel thousands of miles to the southeastern province to find a middleman to settle accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"However, cash has become a commodity, can they agree?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately's heart is really uncertain, at least on him, it is unacceptable for cash to become a commodity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's up to them. Anyway, if you don't have any money now, they will either accept the goods to pay off the debt, or they will wait until you have money to collect. At most, they will beat you up and let out a bad breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they wish to kill you, for the sake of money, they still want you to live well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one of them is impulsive, others will help stop it. After all, if you really have an accident, the debt will be even more difficult to collect. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one who owes the debt is the uncle, and the same applies in the continent of Aslante. If creditors are irrational, it must be that you don't owe enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are few creditors who owe more than 50,000 gold coins like Baron Kettley can give up.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Baron Kettley came to the door that day, looking like a broken pot, obviously planning to kill the fish and kill the net.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is aristocrats, not actors. If there is a way out, that kind of despair is difficult to deduce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two hadn't colluded beforehand, they had colluded together afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is known without analysis—benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, Hudson is the most likely person in the southeastern province to buy those slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the price at which the transaction is made, it is a stop loss for Baron Kettley.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Created an established fact, even if Sith wanted to object, it was useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, you bastard!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How dare you play tricks on me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I remember you, let's see! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson, the leader of the mountain region, who kept instructing his subordinates to resettle the slaves, became busy again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many orc slaves added at once, the original territory development plan is bound to undergo major changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to manage these slaves, Hudson had to announce the expansion of an infantry regiment dedicated to monitoring the work of these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The output has not been seen, but the military expenditure has risen first. Fortunately, the weapons and equipment are all self-produced, which saves a lot of expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly became the nobleman with the most troops in the two counties, but Hudson still felt that he was understaffed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he wasn't worried about the rapid expansion of the troops, which would affect the combat effectiveness, he wouldn't mind forming two infantry regiments at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not about resorting to military action, it's a practical need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since slaves are to be used in large quantities, they must be prepared to suppress the rebellion at any time. It is absolutely impossible to have no soldiers in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous expansion of business, there are gradually more special customers who require door-to-door delivery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the donors are willing to add money, the demand for door-to-door delivery must be met, and it will be a matter of time before they provide armed **** services.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told Hudson that there is no rush to expand the army, and it can only be completed gradually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most urgent task is to adjust the development plan of the territory first, or to improve the original target requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, the expansion of mine capacity is necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether or not the market in the north can be opened up, the goods used to pay for slaves must be produced for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident, they are mainly daily necessities, pots and pans, and agricultural tools only account for a small part.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is to worry about those unscrupulous slave traders who really sold these goods to the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Day-to-day necessities are nothing more than a convenience to the orc's lifestyle, but it will not increase the overall national strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But farm tools are different. If a large number of farm tools flow into the orc empire, it can increase farming efficiency and production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a patriotic nobleman, Hudson still would not do this kind of unscrupulous business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether melting pots into swords will happen, Hudson said generously: Although the smelting is complete, he will lose if he can produce qualified weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least ordinary smelting methods will not work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find a few alchemists, or master blacksmiths of the dwarves, then there is no guarantee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of high-end talent, no matter where it is, is a minority. Even if high-quality weapons can be produced, they cannot be mass-produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, Hudson expanded several business lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hong Fu, Baron Tosis, invited many merchants in the southeastern provinces to Dardir City, which happened to create an opportunity for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was in Dardir City on the surface, he did not make any moves; but the small movements in the dark did not stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief contact, Hudson found several partners with certain financial strength who were willing to sell mountain collar products on an agency basis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Baron Sith knew the news, he would probably understand why Hudson didn't make trouble at the trade fair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with nobles, merchants are often at a disadvantage. Therefore, when looking for a partner, they always look for nobles who abide by the rules as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reassure everyone, Baron Sith chose to abide by the rules of the game knowing that he was cheated, and the same applies to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with developing agents and building your own business network, doing things in Dadir City is obviously not that important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shipping channels have been increased, and the next orders will definitely increase a lot. Production capacity must be prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Road planning must also be arranged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many coolies, it is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These one-brained guys are just right for cracking rocks. I'm so exhausted every day that I don't have the energy to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Developing transportation earlier will also help strengthen Master Hudson's control over the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not known whether orc slaves are competent for the technical work of opening up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it doesn't work, let them go to the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High-tech play Hudson doesn't and doesn't need to be that much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Play directly with the rough open channel drainage, and first remove the water that can be drained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Water that cannot be drained, and \"bamboo and wood fences\" are built to separate rivers and cultivated land in the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the abundant rain in the southeastern province, the salt brought by the sea was washed away. Judging from the plants growing in the swamp, the salt content in the swamp is not too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about wasting the excavated silt. It is a good fertilizer, which is just right for the newly opened raw land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for doing this, how much labor is required and how much loss must be endured, Hudson can't take care of it all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more than 20,000 more mouths, the daily expenses of the territory almost doubled. His wallet wouldn't hold up if he didn't get something done soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is the result of preparation in advance. If Hudson hadn't stored a large amount of grain in advance, he might have cried in the face of the high price of grain on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all the fault of the orc slaves. Although the Governor's Mansion promised to provide cheap food, it was only limited to the previously registered citizens. The orc slaves who came in later could only buy food from the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the southeast province is a major producer of grain. If it is left in some poor places, tens of thousands of mouths will pour into it when the crops are scarce, and even if they have money, they may not be able to buy enough grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, all the northern Xinjiang nobles were tricked again. Lord Ketterley had not been able to borrow enough money, not unrelated to the rise in food prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this kind of day will not last long. Winter has come to an end, and the day of harvesting new grain is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When new grains are put into storage, the price of grains in the market will inevitably drop. As for how much it can drop, Hudson is not clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this has nothing to do with him. Although the food in the territory is not enough, the food produced in the territory of several relatives of the family has been reserved by him early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price naturally follows the market price, but if you can't stand it, you can pay on credit! The foreign debt is getting more and more tiring, and Hudson is now numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is counted as the operating debt of undelivered goods, at this moment, Master Hudson's total foreign debt has exceeded the 120,000 mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a debt, even if it is placed in some middle-class aristocratic family, will cause scalp numbness and sleepless nights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I reckoned that selling Bear Stearns might fill in the hole!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, selling bears is impossible. I have never heard of contracted monsters that can be transferred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson is not someone who needs to sell bears to pay off his debts. Although the foreign debt is huge, the cash flow of the Mountain Territory is still sufficient, and there are 20,000 to 30,000 gold coins lying in the treasury at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the foreign debts as high as 120,000 gold coins, more than 80,000 gold coins are operating debts, including the \"60,000 gold coins\" expenditure for buying orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a debt of 30,000 gold coins, which is being continuously converted into operating debt. Those who really need to fill in real money only need more than 10,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's right, the last more than 10,000 gold coins are owed to my father, Baron Redman. Parents and sons also have to settle accounts clearly, and help can't be taken in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment, pots and pans, farm tools, everything that can be paid for, Hudson has paid for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is nothing in my hometown, and there is really no refill, so I can only pay in cash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for when to pay it back, it depends on the finances of the Mountain Territory, when will it be rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the funds in the account are concerned, Hudson does not dare to tamper with them. In case something unexpected happens one day, these are life-saving money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that there are too many debts, and Hudson, who owes huge debts, is also very popular in the aristocratic circle, and no one even thinks he is poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 20,000 citizens + more than 20,000 slaves, simply counting the population, have caught up with some fiefdom viscounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it settles for a few years, the operating debts will be settled. If hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land are opened up, the foundation of a middle-class nobleman will be established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, an advance payment of 2,000 gold coins has been entered into the account today. It is mainly a batch of agricultural tools and daily necessities sent to the three counties of Hansen, Kadar, and Warren, including a small amount of weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three agents are waiting outside, do you see...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the old butler finished speaking, Hudson interrupted directly: \"I won't show up. For such small matters, you will be responsible for receiving them from now on.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is Party B, it is also a domineering Party B who has mastered the core competitiveness. Being able to receive an advance payment and then organize production is enough to explain everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the disparity in the status of nobles and ticket merchants, Hudson has the capital of not showing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this kind of anonymity is good for everyone. Businessmen are profit-seeking, and they like to compare pennies and pennies, so it's just right for them to argue with the housekeeper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson came to negotiate in person, even if the negotiation can be reached, I am afraid that everyone will feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Operating debt increased again, and Hudson didn't bother to do the calculations. According to the existing operating model, for a long period of time in the future, Mountain Land will have to operate under high debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there are too few upstream suppliers, otherwise there will be more debts. Having deeply realized the benefits of using other people's money to develop his own territory, Hudson seemed to have opened Pandora's box.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the account sheet on the bamboo slips, Hudson deeply felt that the products in his territory were too single.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All revolve around \"iron\". If a few more iron mines are discovered in the southeastern province one day, his business, Mr. Hudson, may be shattered in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if it doesn't revolve around \"iron\", what else can you do to make a fortune these days?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, the feudal dynasties have made the most huge profits with \"salt\" and \"iron\". It is pure luck to be able to share a cup of \"iron\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Salt\", if Hudson dares to reach out. It is estimated that on a dark and windy night, the mountain leader was wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that, driven by huge profits, the Dalton family can definitely do this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to gossip, the profit from salt accounted for half of the Dalton family's income. Anyone who dares to touch this cake will be turned upside down in minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some nobles are not reconciled, at most they secretly instigate a few merchants to sell smuggled salt, and they have to be careful lest the slightest bit of news leak out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, the slightest sign of trouble scares them into killing people. As a result, more private salt dealers died in the hands of the mastermind behind the scenes than were wiped out by the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether these guys made money from it, Hudson thinks no, at least they didn't make huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is quite simple, salt sales are generally stable everywhere and have risen slightly over time. Once there is a decline in sales, it will immediately attract the attention of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, not to mention wanting to make money, and not being caught by others, that is the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the most lucrative industry cannot be reached, it can only settle for the second-best industry—\"tobacco and alcohol\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tobacco is ruled out first, there is no stuff in the continent of Aslante, even if Hudson can find tobacco leaves, he doesn't know who to sell it to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"wine\", it must be wine. At many of the banquets Hudson attended, wine was used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Southeast Province is located in the south of the Kingdom just by its name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is indeed plenty of rain, but as for the light, it can only depend on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a year with little rain like this year, the sunlight is sufficient, and the grapes grown will look good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it has been a rainy year, and it would be nice to see the fruit of the grapes. What do you expect from the quality of the grapes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main buyers of wine are nobles, although most of the nobles are old and rough, and cannot tell whether the wine is good or bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But some of them are \"people-oriented\", but they have studied this stuff deeply and have the right to speak in the industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson can produce it, it can only dawdle in the most competitive \"low-end wine\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of earning that hard-earned money, it's better to create liquor and slowly cultivate the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just imagination. Before finding users, the steady Hudson will not blindly develop products that run counter to the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these products, what else can you do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Matches\", it seems that it is difficult to produce. Pure manual work, just think about how high the production cost is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just easy to use, I am afraid it will be difficult to sell at a high price. After all, noble gentlemen don't need to live and cook by themselves, so is it important for servants to be convenient?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Soap\", a must-have product for travelers. But that smelly thing is mainly used for washing clothes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to stand out, unless you change the production process and produce new products without odor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, pure animal oil cannot be used as a raw material, otherwise the peculiar smell cannot be eliminated. It is no different from the stinky soap on the market, and Hudson doesn't think that there are huge profits in the rotten street stuff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vegetable oil substitute, it seems that you can try it. However, with the current production of vegetable oil, I am afraid that it will not be expected in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This new thing can only make a quick buck. Once the technology is deciphered by others, followers will appear soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aslante is not popular with patent protection. Even if there is patent protection, Hudson does not have the strength to fight piracy all over the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a fortune to make a fortune, and Hudson has decided to increase vegetable oil production. After accumulating enough raw materials, go out and make a wave of quick money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the technology leak, at least it can occupy a place in the market by relying on the name of the starter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People's hearts are full of meat. When the price is comparable, everyone still prefers to use genuine products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the quality of the original product is not as good as the pirated version, then there is nothing to say, and it deserves to be eliminated by the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to get involved in that, Hudson also admits it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The scars left by the war have faded from Wright and Wyton counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The joy of a good harvest is the most heart-warming. The spring grains are in storage, and the days of starvation are coming to an end, and the mountain leaders are also immersed in joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson, who was in a good mood, even generously invited the citizens to taste white bread once. Raised the conscience of the lord's world to a new height.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the hard-working slave finally enjoyed a lunch without eating dirt on this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a bad start by a group of northern nobles. Originally, Master Hudson never added soil to the bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since learning the rumor that orcs can eat soil, the poor-quality bread provided to these guys has increased by 10% saline soil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect is very good. The cost of salt in the territory has dropped by one-third. The expenditure on rations has also been reduced a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, it also shocked people's hearts and greatly improved the progress of land reclamation. Especially the few guarantors who are late in the progress, all of them are working hard, for fear that they will have to live on dirt after consecutive bottoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, Master Hudson is still kind, and he didn't let everyone eat dirt directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the \"Baobao\" who is at the bottom of the land reclamation is really having a hard time. It is a basic operation to replace the chief of staff. The rations can only get the lowest share of the people, and all kinds of benefits have to be paid later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also affected are the working groups with the slowest progress in the mining area. The final elimination system was obviously mastered by Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, he became the person he hated the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some tossing, the effect is also remarkable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production capacity of the mining area is rising steadily, and the monthly output value on the books directly exceeds the 15,000 gold coin mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this output value, the distance from paying off the debt is still far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by opening up new markets. Master Hudson, who is addicted to advance payment, couldn't stop at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the price of expanding production, the net profit of the product plummets. It is mainly the middleman channel, which takes away part of the profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is worthwhile, and the result of the profit sharing directly led to the Mountain Territory becoming the largest iron products trading center in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horse-drawn carriages that flow endlessly every day, it seems that it is a prosperous place. The booming business has greatly enhanced the confidence of creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to provide better services to business travelers, Master Hudson even stopped the construction team of the Lord's Mansion, and built hotels and taverns as quickly as possible...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the rising turnover, Hudson was not happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has never been a good business model to supplement the price with quantity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the excess profits brought by the production of weapons and equipment, making these ordinary daily necessities is completely incomparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the supporting service industry is included, the net income of the territory has dropped by 20% compared with the peak period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, it is not a listed company and does not need to release financial reports to the outside world, otherwise the stock price would have to plummet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prosperity can cover up all crises, and the scene of heavy traffic allows Hudson to successfully create a person who is not bad for money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the debt owed, as long as it does not need to be paid in real money, all of them can be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone comes to collect collections, it is evidence of a booming business. As long as the mine is not hollowed out, this scene can continue to sing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frantically accumulating money is finally reflected in the construction of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** road under construction has been completed for 7 miles and is still expanding at a rate of 3 miles per month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no mechanical equipment, it is done purely by hand, and the speed can be achieved because of the face of the terrain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the repair and widening of the original road, the total mileage of the avenue that can accommodate two carriages has directly exceeded eighteen miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of forked paths, that's more. It was not included in the statistical category just because it did not meet the high requirements of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results of land reclamation also exceeded expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of involution is remarkable. The original plan of 20,000 mu has been directly increased to 33,000 mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The data directly made Master Hudson abandon his uneasy conscience. Facts have proved that grinding foreign labor is indeed undesirable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the increase in labor force in the later period is also one of the reasons for exceeding expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that has not seen results is the swampland. After all, the development time is too short, and only a few hundred acres of land have been successfully isolated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson is the least anxious. The rows of ditches will not deceive people, once they are connected, they will become a water network.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raised land in the middle is just used to grow rice, and even the seed Hudson was bought back by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom does not have the habit of eating rice, this does not affect Hudson's decision in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't sell it, you can eat it at home, which is to improve everyone's living habits. Anyway, judging from the situation in the mountainous territories, there will be no food to sell for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind the remarkable achievements, there must be a dark scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serfs are alright. Although they are attrition, the population still increases slightly including those in the stomachs of pregnant women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of slaves is a bit big, it may be that they have no experience in managing slaves for the first time, and more than 500 people were lost in less than two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the swamp swallowed half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of them are stupid. When working, he is careless, sneaky and sneaky, and does not take safety production seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing this situation, the supervisors were also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reminder \"again and again, again and again\", despite the fact that everyone can't understand the language, it's all about playing the piano with cows, pigs, mice, and....\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he did not inherit the IQ of the second senior brother, Pig's casualty rate directly occupied the top spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make up for the loss, you only need to lock the male and female piggies together and let them mate freely, and a new litter can be added in a few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, as an orthodox nobleman, Hudson would definitely not do this kind of expansion of the orc group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What can you do? The race that eats first is obviously not the labor force that Master Hudson needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Survival of the fittest is a natural law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of these slave races in the Orc Empire, and they are far from the point where they need to protect endangered species.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous region is booming, and other nobles are not idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, who has been cheated many times by Hudson, finally managed to catch up with this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Benefiting from the increase in business travel to and from the Mountain Territory, the casinos and entertainment venues in the Maple Leaf Territory have also boosted their business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not popular, it is finally profitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the hot performances of interracial beauties can attract a lot of attention every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Baron Kettley has regulations. These women usually only receive nobles for the night, and do not accept business from merchants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only exception is the monthly auction, where the highest bidder wins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical self-inflated prices, but everyone still likes it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Baron Kettler could earn more, but unfortunately, Baron Sith followed suit in Dadir City and stole a large number of noble customers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for Hudson to do something, the conflict of interests made the relationship between the two worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of money is destined to not last long. If there are no accidents, there will be many northern nobles following up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even some jealous guys who are not qualified to follow suit will directly sell beauties of different races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These two are not the only nobles in the north who have developed well. One side of water and soil has the characteristics of one side of water and soil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some smart nobles have already sold some special products of the Northland locally. The business is not very good, but it is profitable after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can make money by doing business, so why fight and kill?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The days of Liwei are over, what is needed now is integration. Smart people have adjusted their mentality early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this kind of peaceful life lasts for a hundred or eighty years, it is estimated that the label of \"Northern Nobility\" will gradually fade from people's sight, leaving only a folktale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the reality is cruel. Just as the spring plowing was arranged, Hudson received an unexpected letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Miss Melissa, who was studying in the capital, suddenly sent a letter telling him that Kayo Dalton graduated early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This familiar yet unfamiliar name quickly awakened Hudson's memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord of Fallen Leaf Town in Wyton County, who has not arrived for a long time, happens to be called by this name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just this identity, it's not enough to move Hudson. A baron in the area, he has long ignored him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is this guy's last name—Dalton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has used his family connections to inquire. This guy is the nephew of the current owner, Earl Pierce, and he is also the only nephew.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for being big enough, he wouldn't be named in the kingdom's mage group. After a few credits, he got a rich fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reincarnation is such a technical job, I can't envy you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no one there, but the development of Luoye Town is not slow at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is just a steward who is in charge of the territory, relying on the name of the Dalton family, it will still be smooth sailing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a strong background and developing within his own sphere of influence, as long as Baron Cayo is not an idiot, there is basically no suspense about the position of Sheriff of Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in Wyton County are far less active than the nobles in Wright County, and it is estimated that this is also the reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that they can't compete, naturally no one will take the lead easily and arouse the hostility of the future county guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike Wright County, from the beginning of a pack of heroes, it has developed into a duo now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the final result comes out, no one dares to say who will have the last laugh, Hudson or Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of Hudson, I naturally hope that this guy will spend a few more years in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo is not here, Hudson is the most eye-catching boy among the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few active representatives at the beginning had been taught by the nobles of the Northlands in the previous struggles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loser has no right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only Hudson who has fought against the nobles of the Northland many times and has not been beaten by society has naturally become a spiritual leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This identity does not have any substantial power, but it has great influence among the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The smooth development of the mountainous territory is also strongly related to this invisible influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the military strength and financial resources of the Mountain Territory, even if you go outside, you can still be looked at.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all of these things add up to a surname of \"Dalton\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that all the local nobles will be pulled over, but it is inevitable that Hudson's right to speak among the local nobles will be diverted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that soft power will be weakened, Hudson can't do anything about the perpetrator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Replying a letter as quickly as possible, arranging a gift, and asking someone to bring it over as a token of gratitude, Hudson immediately threw himself into the response.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although members of the Koslow family are widely distributed, most of them are concentrated in the lower layers of the aristocratic group, and the penetration into the middle and upper layers is really too weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, with Kayo's status, he should have been noticed by the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it was Miss Melissa who first notified Hudson of the important news of graduating early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it because the family members in the imperial capital deliberately slack off, or is there really nothing they can do. Hudson prefers to believe it's the latter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stalking at the Academy of Magic is obviously not something ordinary people can do. As far as the size of the Koslow family is concerned, it's just too tiring to get close to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of being caught by others, it will be +1 for the magic test subject.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gentle mages, who seem to be gentle and elegant, are never soft when they are tossing people. Running around in front of people and sneaking around is simply tired of work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letters one after another kept flying out from the mountains, as if the parchment was free of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the spread of the letter, a **** storm that is about to unfold around the two counties of Wyton and Wright began to brew secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, Baron Cayo, who has completed the graduation ceremony, is looking at the campus with the last nostalgia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, it's time to get on the road.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The housekeeper's words pulled Kayo out of his memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, let's go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Baron Cayo turned and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to inheriting the territory, he is more willing to become a great magician, to explore the true meaning of life, and wait for one day to become a saint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that magician is a profession that requires talent. The Magic Academy has gathered magic elites from the entire kingdom, but in the end there are very few who are qualified to explore in depth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is almost 30 years old and has not yet been able to become a senior mage. Kayo's path as a magician has basically been declared dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Noble children can have ideals, but they are never allowed to be divorced from reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After encountering a bottleneck and being unable to break through for a long time, Kayo also had to change his path.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A magician is much more expensive than a knight gold, but just an intermediate magician is still dispensable to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless he can become a wizard, Kayo won't have much say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the current title, there are many interested children in the family. If his uncle was not the head of the family, such a good job would not have fallen on him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he got into the carriage, Kayo kept looking through the documents, which not only showed the development of Fallen Leaf Town, but also clearly recorded everything that happened in the two counties of Wyton and Wright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The background of the big nobles is not comparable to that of the small nobles. Not long after Baron Cayo's convoy left the capital, Sith received the exact news, and even the route they took was marked out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the information, this Baron Cayo is a magic madman. I really don't know what the Dalton family thinks about letting such a person be the lord of the Fallen Leaf Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think our Baron Hudson will have a common topic with him, after all, they are all magicians! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith said contemptuously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he looks down on people on purpose. In fact, they are both magicians, and they are also divided into three, six, and nine classes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, a wild mage who relies on luck, has always been the most despised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others have worked hard for decades, but in the end they become magicians with the guys who are talented in Warcraft, and normal people will feel unbalanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially a lucky guy like Hudson, who got the talent of the Earth Bear, is even more hated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the same level of cultivation, an orthodox mage who works hard will most likely not be able to beat a wild mage who came out. Who will not have a broken mind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for students who were dismissed from the Magic Academy due to lack of talent, it was even more exciting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that Kayo and Hudson are still competitors. If there is a little jealousy mixed in with the interests, the scene will be even better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the two quarrel, the local nobles will be divided. For all the nobles of the Northlands, this is a very good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, these materials may not be true. What the Dalton family wants is not just a fallen leaf collar, their appetite is much greater than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whitton County seems to be at peace. That's because Baron Cayo, the main character, is not around. Everyone deliberately restrained their desire to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this guy's performance falls short of expectations, I'm afraid it will not be so peaceful in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the competition is so fierce, no matter how willful the Dalton family is, it is impossible to help a pig to the position of sheriff. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun's words made Baron Sith's face darken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world of great contention, all families continue to allocate resources to the best children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was in the peaceful years, it would be fine if he was an illegitimate child who was incompetent. If he really wanted extraordinary ability, that would be the way to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the illegitimate children can all share part of the resources because of their own abilities, which is enough to prove that it is a harbinger of the coming storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, it is obviously illogical for the Dalton family to throw precious resources on a waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are right, indeed no one should be underestimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although on the bright side, the Hudson guy will be affected by Kayo's arrival, but the two are not in the same county after all, and the probability of a conflict breaking out in a short time is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, because of the arrival of Kayo, some nobles who were suppressed by us will become active again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that Kayo also needs to build up his prestige, so he may take advantage of the trend and point the finger at my northern Xinjiang children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern nobles in Wyton County have been hit, and it is difficult for Dadir City to survive alone. Once the turmoil expands, I'm afraid I will have to face it in the end. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have once again proved that it is not easy to be the boss. Obviously it has nothing to do with him, but he has no choice but to stand up for the younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, I'm afraid this is not a 'maybe', but a 'definitely'.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the first time, this Baron Cayo only has the surname of Dalton, and it is difficult to suppress the mountain baron in terms of prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Promptly provoking internal disputes will not only disappoint the nobles who want revenge, but also push many originally neutral local nobles to his opposite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Baron Cayo can give up the leadership dispute among the local nobles, even if he doesn't want to turn against us, I'm afraid he won't be able to help himself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After doing such a big thing, he didn't even have the thought of taking the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a miracle that such a character can be born in a small noble family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Pereira who hoarded supplies and made a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a businessman's style, but his control of the timing is just right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the economy is involved, but the political aspect is also considered.

The key is that he is shameless enough and able to stop just right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A nobleman can put down his face and know how to advance and retreat, no matter where he is, he will not mess up too badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Loser Baron Ezekiel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Organized the local nobles to join hands with the northern nobles, and ended in a disastrous defeat. The outside world thinks he lost, but I don't think so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From obscurity, he has become a well-known existence among the local nobles. Fame is his greatest achievement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, being able to organize more than 20 nobles with different interests under the situation of absolute disadvantage is a remarkable achievement in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most surprising mountain baron is simply the chosen one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only has an amazing talent for archery, but he can meet the bear of the earth to recognize his master as soon as he leaves the house. Watching plays and paddling all the way on the battlefield, military achievements will be delivered to your door by yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose a remote territory, not only fortunately avoided the most intense aristocratic battle in the early stage, but also made him a fortune in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development speed of the territory is even more unexpected. It seems that he hasn't done anything, and there are cheap offers coming to him constantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his political performance is immature, his invincible luck is enough to cover up all his shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, when encountering this kind of opponent, it is best not to confront him head-on before his luck runs out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many heroes, squeezed together. Provoking a dispute rashly, I am not sure that it will end according to my own will. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo analyzed calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he wants salted fish, it's because there are too many local elves in the two counties of Wright and Wyton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a latecomer, it loses its first-mover advantage. Noble birth is an advantage, but this advantage is not without cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the toss is too strong, there is a high probability that a group of ambitious people will join forces to kick him out first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the analysis can now be done clearly and logically, it is only based on the after-the-fact results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Family background and extraordinary knowledge do not mean that they can have an advantage in actual operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The analysis is good. It seems that your life in the capital was not in vain, and you still learned some wisdom from those old foxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As big nobles, we are different from the minor nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have limited family resources, so they can only continue to fight, fight, and take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they have succeeded countless times before and their foundations are unstable, as long as they fail once, everything they own will be returned to their original form.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    伱 is also familiar with history books. Throughout the past and present, countless smart people have fallen on the way, but some not so smart people have made it to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason is that they are too smart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things obtained by calculation are too easy, and people will gradually get lost in it, thinking that they can calculate everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same is true in the current two counties. Those who like to calculate the most seem to be very powerful, but in fact they are destined to be eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Baron Ezekiel. His organizational skills and ability to control people's hearts are very strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another time and place might be able to stir up some troubles. Unfortunately, he was unlucky and met a group of northern nobles who believed in strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has gained a lot of fame, the question is, can you tolerate his rise, or will the mountain baron leave him a chance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competitors locked the way forward. After all, fame is just fame, and fame that cannot be transformed into strength is actually worthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also that Baron Kettley, look through his resume, you will find that this guy is more powerful than the above guys, and his name is also on the wanted document of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about the final result?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountered an enemy of luck, every calculation he made was paving the way for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, what we see may not be true, and it may be what these guys want us to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each of them seems to have shown their abilities, but they all tend to one side. Even if it is to seek profit, it is just right to make a quick profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are biased towards one side, isn't there a balanced type? A coincidence may be a coincidence, but if a bunch of coincidences come together, there must be a conspiracy behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Temporary success or failure does not mean anything. Many things that seem simple to us may also have countless calculations behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, I don't think that the little guy Hudson can rise, it's all luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are really lucky, Kettley will suffer a loss once or twice at most, and will never send it to your door all the time to be manipulated by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe, I'm being tricked and I don't even know it. After all, designing a person doesn't need to be aimed at himself, starting from the cronies around him can also achieve the goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to fool a smart person, but it's very easy to fool a bunch of idiots. It just so happens that there will always be a group of idiots following around these middle and small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the noble children in the north, the army under his command is really elite. The elite army under our Divine Bow Knight is mainly obtained by blowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What surprised me was that after being bragged for a long time by everyone, the gang of mobs under his command really became elites in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the second 1,000-man infantry regiment is completed, the military strength of the Mountain Territory will surpass that of Dadir City, and it will become the noble with the strongest military strength in the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other nobles can only be envious and jealous. Even if they want to be militaristic, no territory can support two infantry regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not something that can be done by luck alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Koslow family behind him was not too weak to provide him with too much support, I am afraid that Baron Sith would have been tossed down long ago. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Father, like son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing in the position of Earl Pierce, many things no longer need evidence, and the answer can be obtained only by inferring the results after the event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you cover it up, the final result cannot be covered up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, why didn't uncle stop it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you give him some stumbling blocks, the Mountain Territory will not develop at all. Even just needing to let out a little bit of wind, the creditors will give him a lot of trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, you're wrong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that I don't want to trip him up, but that I can't trip him up. Although I don't like that lucky boy, the Dalton family needs a strong mountain baron right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful Hudson is, he is only the son of a baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing I can rely on is myself. After tossing so far, the family's help has been minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only relying on his own strength, a Salam mountain range is enough for him to toss for many years, and it can't threaten us at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Sith Baron had a Grand Duke father. Leaking any resources at will will allow him to gain a firm foothold in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the Felix family is still far above the family. Leaving this nail in the backyard, I can hardly sleep or eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things are more complicated than what you see. The position of Sheriff, which seems to be hotly contested, has been decided early in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sheriff of Wright County is the Baron Sith, no matter how hard Hudson works, the final result has already been set.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not announced to the outside world. It was because Grand Duke Kavadia wanted to sharpen his son and deliberately indulged their fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no one to check and balance, let Wright County fall into the hands of the Felix family. If the situation changes in the future and the Dalton family suffers setbacks, who can guarantee that they will not turn against customers and seize our foundation? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Previous convictions are very important, and the Felix family has too many dark histories. With such a neighbor behind him, it is difficult to be careful and vigilant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for \"fairness\", that is only theoretical. Class solidification has long since penetrated into every corner of the Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is not bad, but with the threat of the Orc Empire, the nobles dare not go too far. On the bright side, the fig leaf of \"fairness\" has been maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the interests involved are large enough, this fig leaf is not enough. In the end, it was still - father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The mainland is going to be in chaos!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the experience of history. Whenever there are a large number of talents, it is the starting point of chaos in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When these elites find that there is no room for them to improve in this world, they will inevitably stir up the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The simplest operation is to start a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One radish, one pit. Only after the original radish is pulled out, can some radish be inserted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is not up to you to decide whether the mainland is chaotic or not. The Felix family has appointed the Sheriff of Wright County by default, which does not mean that your position as Sheriff of Wyton County will be stable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many eyes on it, the kingdom needs to cover up. So it's very unfortunate that you have to fight for the position of Sheriff of Wyton on your own merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that those guys in the North didn't dare to fight with the Felix family doesn't mean they didn't dare to fight with us. Don't look at these nobles who are very disciplined now, it's just that no one wants to be a leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it is launched, you are likely to be targeted by their joint efforts. The Fallen Leaf Town you went to this time is not as peaceful as it seems on the surface. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the anger on his brows, it can be seen that Earl Pierce is very dissatisfied with the results of this bullying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the arms can't hold the thighs. The Dalton family is only the overlord of the southeastern province. Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, it is just an ordinary family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the governor has a high position and authority, it does not mean that the appointment of the main officials in the province can be made by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to promote your cronies, you have to ask the king to agree. The most basic principle of checks and balances, every monarch with a passing ability knows how to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III happened to be a man of great power, with top-notch skills in mixing sand and playing checks and balances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As strong as the five giants in the Northland, isn't the old nest being checked and balanced by the kingdom's garrison? The criss-crossing and mutual checks and balances are the essence of the political balance of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't know that the fruits of victory had been picked long ago, is still busy making connections at this moment. Whether or not Baron Cayo is going to take the stage, the stage has to be set.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First stir up public opinion, even if Baron Cayo does not buy it, at least he can guarantee that the three fires brought by the new lord will not be burned on his own head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson didn't lead everyone to start a fight with the northern nobles, it was because the local nobles were not strong enough, and there was no chance of winning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he was a little bit cowardly, except for the victim, other nobles supported him. No one is willing to use their hard-earned family fortune to participate in a gamble with no chance of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cocayo is different. As a direct descendant of the Dalton family, he represents the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impulsive ones in the early stage happened to be mostly the younger brothers of the Dalton family. It's perfectly fine for a little brother who has been wronged to seek out his boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether he is in his early years or not, Baron Cayo is busy. People who are busy don't have time to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to deliver this pair of golden horses to Baron Sith.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests. With one more competitor entering the arena, this farce should be performed in a different way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all smart people, and many things don't need to be explained too clearly, just a little hint is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The confrontation must continue, but we must pay attention to the scale. Can't make a real fire, lest it can't end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he lost to Hudson, Baron Sith is still the lord of Dardir City, and he can make a comeback after being silent for a while at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they lost to the one representing the Dalton family, they might pack up and leave, and bid farewell to Wright County forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of Hudson is the same, the battle with Baron Sith for the sheriff is not fatal. Even if the post of sheriff is gone, the titles of administrative officer, judicial officer, and military officer can always be obtained, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Alpha Kingdom, there is no saying that you are the sheriff, and all the officials in the county are appointed by you. On the contrary, there is a high probability that these officials will be your opponents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the result of the above and below, and the king uses this method to check and balance the governors of various places. The governor's mansion learned it logically, and tossed the county mansion below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing the position of county guard does not mean that the right to speak is completely lost. It is mainly the income from taxes, which is eaten up by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, the income of 10,000 to 20,000 gold coins is not a big problem. Anyway, no matter how much Baron Sith can search, it is impossible to get the excess showdown on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in a hurry, you can still resist taxes. According to incomplete statistics, there are dozens of anti-tax movements in the Kingdom every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It usually happens when the officials in charge of tax collection are not strong enough to suppress the local nobles. There are also a small number of officials who are too greedy, exceeding the tolerance limit of local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The latter is less likely to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Exploiting nobles is not a good choice. After being treated unfairly, relatives and friends come here to ask for an explanation, but it doesn't end so well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the popularity is extremely poor, nobles are rarely bullied in this regard. Adding a little bit is fine, but if you cross the line, something big will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the nobles involved will call their friends and make trouble, but also nobles who have received news from nearby will join in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, if others are bullied today, you don't stand up; if you are bullied tomorrow, who will stand up to help?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter got serious, and the Kingdom will not spare the officials who caused the trouble lightly after they are investigated. In case of serious consequences, it may even be directly deprived of the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if they lost to the Dalton family, it would be different. Not only is the position of the county magistrate useless, but he has no place in the county official position, and he may still be excluded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the southeastern province, no matter which noble it is, it cannot stand the sanctions of the Dalton family. Once caught, it is impossible to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the current rapid development of mountainous areas mainly depends on playing with financial leverage. Many things were fooled by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once there is a conflict with the Dalton family, no one can guarantee whether the creditors can sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In fact, from the beginning to the end, he just built a stage, and the rest of the performance was left to everyone to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The less involved, the less exposed problems will naturally be. If it weren't for someone with a heart, it is estimated that Hudson would not have been involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to adding the \"Swamp Brand\" fertilizer, Hudson has never done any new tricks. The main reason is that they are not familiar with farming techniques, so they dare not command blindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having eaten a wave of fertilizer dividends, Hudson is obviously ready to continue. You must know that the last time the spring grain was put into storage, the average yield of rye per mu reached an astonishing 203 pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This figure, in an era when the average yield per mu was only 145 pounds, was simply a bumper crop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the serfs' limited knowledge reserves, they only knew about the abundant grain harvest in the territory, but didn't know the specific output, and if it was spread out, it would be able to cause a sensation in the entire Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spring grain production was originally low, but it actually broke the record. If it wasn't blessed by the gods, who would believe it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just make a fortune in silence, Hudson will not do such a showy thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone's grain harvests are increased together, it will not be a good thing for the nobles in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, those guys in northern Xinjiang will get rid of the shackles of food, and the balance of the kingdom will be broken, which will inevitably set off a new round of political struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order of the kingdom is in chaos, without the protection of the rule system, the immature mountain territory cannot withstand the wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only two infantry regiments in the area, and it is okay to dominate the county. Putting it in the vortex of the storm, it will be smashed to pieces in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plains grow staple food rye, potatoes, and a small amount of wheat. The difference is limited to this year's seeds, but the selected large particles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too difficult to breed fine breeds, which is completely beyond the scope of Hudson's cognition, and can only be screened in the most stupid way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much effect it can have depends on the blessing of the Lord of Dawn. Hudson's expectations are not high, and an increase of three to five pounds per acre is considered to be earned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly reclaimed wasteland is all used to grow peanuts, soybeans, flax... and other oil crops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the use of marsh brand fertilizers, Hudson still has no production requirements for the newly reclaimed land, and it counts as much as it can collect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current population and arable land area of ​​the mountainous areas are seriously out of balance. In the next few years, they will have to rely on large-scale purchased food for supplementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The annual plan for this year is to increase the food self-sufficiency rate to one-third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that it can't be higher, it's mainly that it's not worth it. Hudson originally wanted to rely on fertilizers and give up the land fallow, but after weighing the pros and cons, he was forced to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grain output is a little bit higher, and you can find a way to hide it. Even if everyone is aware of it, no one will care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Southeast Province is a well-known grain-producing province. Except for Hudson, as long as the other territories are cultivated normally, there will be no shortage of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a large amount of grain is sold to the North every year, after the remaining grain is satisfied for self-use, everyone still has a lot of surplus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have long been accustomed to a good harvest of grain, and I don't care if the neighbors charged three or five pounds more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fallow system can be broken, and that would be different. It will attract countless eyes in an instant. Once someone finds out that there is a way to maintain production without a fallow, Hudson can't even imagine the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sowing work went very smoothly. Everyone's focus was on their own fields, and no one had time to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Baron Cayo entered the fallen leaf collar during the spring plowing, it did not cause disturbance to the outside world, as if everything was logical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After busy tossing and tossing for more than ten days, and smoothing out the affairs in the territory, everyone's attention was focused on Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, guests gathered, and there was an endless stream of nobles who visited every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of this has nothing to do with Hudson. The other people's territories are all busy, and the busyness of the mountain territory has just begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mining area is busy all year round, and ordinary workers only have two or three days off a month, basically every ten days off, and they have to take turns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the busiest spring plowing did not affect the production of the mining area. Master Hudson, who has enough labor, has no idea of ​​letting workers go to the fields to plow the fields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest change is land reclamation. It took several months last year to open up 33,000 mu of mountain land, which obviously couldn't satisfy Master Hudson's appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This year's goal is much more ambitious than last year. As early as the beginning of the year, Hudson shouted the slogan of \"reclaiming 100,000 acres of wasteland\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the noble lord shouted, the people below were about to lose their legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to let the land reclamation of 100,000 acres become a joke, Hudson also made corresponding plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to split the task into each insurance. After a few months of tossing, the serfs are used to assigning tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the task reward for exceeding the quota. In order to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, Hudson generously announced that one-third of the over-reclaimed land will be used as \"public land\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The property rights naturally belong to Lord Hudson, but the income generated by this part of the \"public land\" can be shared by the serfs who should be \"protected\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specifically, that part of the land will be used as public land, and it will definitely not be allocated. Master Hudson of the chicken thief, how could it be possible to treat them differently?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking care of one's own land is definitely more attentive than taking care of other people's land. If it is really divided, it is certain that the grain production in the public land area is absolutely leveraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So the income of the public land is calculated based on the average yield of all mountain lands. After deducting the cultivation costs, the extra income will be distributed to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a complicated calculation method is obviously a bit embarrassing for the serfs. However, as the bottom of the society, everyone still understands one thing - they can share more food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that this is not an extra share, but a part of the food that can be distributed in addition to the daily ration at the time of harvest every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Work hard for a year, and share food for a lifetime. Such a good thing is rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that Master Hudson was the most greedy vampire guy, and instantly lowered his head in shame. It's really inappropriate, how can you criticize the most generous lord in the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although after following Master Hudson, everyone is busy all year round, but the food standard is also rising!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially, Master Hudson never adds stones, sawdust, soil...these are difficult to swallow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eat well, and the cost will naturally be high. Do a little more work, that's what you should do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the work in the field is limited after all. Land reclamation is nothing new, and the memory passed down by word of mouth from the older generation is something that everyone has heard of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the noble lord is not unlimited. Anyway, he will only be busy for a few years. When the land is reclaimed, he will naturally be able to relax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People yearn for a better life, and Hudson, who succeeded in drawing cakes, quickly calmed down the restless hearts of the serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is thinking about a better life in the future. It's just that they subconsciously forgot that Master Hudson's territory is obviously abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems, and the extra food will be distributed later, which will be enough to appease everyone's dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson will definitely not be stingy. The more he distributes to the younger brothers, the more he, the boss, will get.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did the serfs draw cakes, but even the miners and blacksmiths on the mountain received similar incentives \"big cakes\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the task is overfulfilled, the rewards will be great. As for the difficulty of the task, as long as there are enough \"cakes\", is that still a problem?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only person who can't draw cakes is probably the gang of orc slaves. Even after several months of training, only a few orcs have mastered a few simple words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eat\", \"Work\", \"Sleep\", \"Wake up\"...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To communicate, play the piano to a group of animals. His IQ is not necessarily better than...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to give an example. Although the IQ of an animal is not very good, once it becomes a monster, its IQ will go up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the bears raised at home, you can tell that the IQ is definitely far higher than that of humans of the same age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little bear, who is less than three years old, can actually direct people to milk cows and sheep, and can also fake Hudson's order to ask soldiers to find honey for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, there was no other way. In order to meet the rations of the cubs, the mountain leaders had to start beekeeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any experience and technical reserves, he ran to raise bees. Hudson admired his courage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there is no need to do it yourself, otherwise the honey will not be seen, and the bees will be extinct first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the situation is similar. Master Hudson is inexperienced, and the serfs below are also inexperienced. Everyone is used to eating wild honey, and there is no thought of beekeeping at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just because of the cub's appetite, I had to start from scratch and slowly accumulate experience through practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it succeeds, a new industry will be added; if it fails, it will just waste a few labors, and the salary will be paid by \"Xiong\" anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a special cooperation model that Hudson explored after summing up countless experiences through constant contact with the cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns worked for him and had to pay wages; on the other hand, Xiong had to be responsible for Xiong's daily expenses and training needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one suffers, and no one takes advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, Uncle Xiong has owed Hudson a huge five-figure debt. And, this number is still rising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules agreed by the two parties, Uncle Xiong charged one gold coin per slap, and he would have to slap tens of thousands of bear paws to pay off the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no continuous war, it is estimated that this debt will probably evolve into a lifetime series.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Bear Stearns is not worried at all. The price is low now because he is underage. When you become an adult, the charging standard is different again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, although the strength of the cubs is rising, their physical development is still at the normal bear level. But the unscrupulous Master Hudson is also the master who accepts death, and everything follows the rules of the Earth Bear family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Body size represents strength, and any excess will not be recognized. Anyway, after so many thousands of years, there is only Bear Stearns as an exception, so there is no need to specialize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on a great trick, the dizzy Bear Stearns signed a new cooperation agreement in a daze, and has since become a working bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for losing face, Uncle Xiong would have quit. According to the mutual aid agreement signed at the beginning, the degree of freedom is high, including food and housing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the relationship between the two parties is really equal. It's just that everything for food and clothing has to be calculated, and it is still calculated according to the prevailing price standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the ultimate reason why there is no repentance is that Xiongsheng has not changed much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should eat, drink, and sleep. As long as you don't think about it so much, debt is just a bunch of numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to work part-time to pay off debts. It Bear Stearns is not a hardworking bear, providing security protection for creditors is its greatest contribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no matter how the debt changes, it is impossible to abuse the bodyguards, and the bear's standard of living is guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft all know the pros and cons, choose the most beneficial way of life. In contrast, the IQ of the orcs is really worrying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also the same as Hudson's subordinates are full of garbage orcs, which represents the lower limit of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-intelligence race representing the upper limit among the orcs is no less inferior to humans. It's a pity that these high-intelligence orc races are not only easy to use their brains, but also very strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Dardir City, Baron Sith, who was busy with the affairs of the territory, was free to think about how to deal with the relationship with the Mountain Territory next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing with a pair of golden horses in his hands, he accidentally exerted too much force, and the golden horses showed their true colors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that it was only plated with gold on the outside, but it was made of pig iron inside. No wonder he felt something wrong when holding it in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you stingy and vicious ghost! You don't know how to be generous when giving gifts, and you are not afraid of embarrassing yourself with such junk...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The furious Baron Sith couldn't help but cursed. It's really bullying, even if you wrap a layer of gold skin on the iron, you dare to give it as a gift, it's clear that you don't take him seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, take a closer look to see if there are any organs or handwriting on the golden horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson is not a boring man. Whether it is to show your favor or to provoke you, you will not give this kind of golden horse that represents nothing. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the experiences accumulated over the years. Hudson and Sith each represent the interests of different camps, and the identities of the two parties are not suitable for making friends in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you want to ease the relationship or make trouble. It should also give something symbolic, at least it should be understandable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is it to send a pair of golden horses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it a gold and iron horse?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking carefully at the iron horse in his hand, Baron Sith finally found a few lines of small characters under the horse's belly. The gloomy expression on his face finally eased slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You guessed it right, Hudson really wants to ease the relationship with us. It's just that it's not an ordinary relationship relaxation, but to tighten the outside and loosen the inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to his intention, on the surface, our two families will continue to quarrel. It's just that to control the scale of the conflict, it's best to keep the conflict on the lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the arrival of the Baron Cayo has really brought him a lot of pressure. Otherwise, he would never have thought of acting with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, this should have been a good thing. But now I am hesitating whether to cooperate with him or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many smart people in the two counties, and after so many months of trouble, the only one who has never suffered is this mountain baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at every shot he makes, it seems that he is forced to do it, but in fact, isn't he deliberately guiding?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although easing the relationship between the two now can greatly reduce our pressure. But he has been leading me by the nose, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Sith lacks determination, but that he has suffered too much in the past, and now facing Hudson, he can't help but keep an extra eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, it doesn't matter whether Baron Hudson has other calculations. The key is whether the easing of relations at this moment is really beneficial to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is in our interests, even if he has other calculations, we don't need to go into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of Baron Cayo has weakened his appeal to the local nobles. Perhaps this has little effect on Hudson's military strength, but the political impact is enough for him to bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking counterattacks is also a matter of course. As for the Baron Cayo, the origin of the Dalton family makes us doomed to be two-way people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man analyzed calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he has been with the Grand Duke of Kavadia. Maybe his ability is not very outstanding, but his vision is not comparable to that of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People's hearts are the most unpredictable. It is really too difficult to fully understand the other party's calculations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than guessing blindly, it is better not to bother. As long as it is in their own interests, they can cooperate, otherwise they will be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not making decisions based on one's own preferences is an essential quality for a mature nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment of silence, Baron Sith nodded slowly: \"You're right, I really shouldn't think too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this time I went south, I came to the right place. If I hadn't met so many opponents and suffered so many boring losses, I haven't discovered that I have so many shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This mountain baron is not simple!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, he had a quarrel with us, but now that the situation has changed, he can come over to show his friendship as if nothing had happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just this face-changing skill alone makes me ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this disposition, coupled with his terrifying luck, it might be difficult to suppress this person. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deep fear is palpable, which is the aftermath of the orc slave incident. Although Hudson lowered his sense of existence as much as possible, so many serfs entered the mountain territory, but they couldn't deceive people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without spending a single gold coin, a new market was opened, and the desired labor force was obtained, which divided the noble camp in northern Xinjiang. With such an opponent, it is impossible for Baron Sith not to be afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, if you can't hold back, then don't hold back! Luck can't be with you all the time, and some things are destined not to be rushed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few years, look back. You will find that most of the influential figures in the past have been reduced to the dust of history, but a group of seemingly ordinary guys stood at the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar opponents, the Grand Duke also encountered in the past. But these lucky ones can be successful for ten or twenty years, but it is difficult for them to be successful for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To deal with this kind of person, you need to make a layout slowly. If the young master is willing, we can arrange it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the rise of the small nobles, the most lacking thing is talent. Within their circle, it is simply impossible to recruit enough talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So after the development reaches a certain level, foreign talents will inevitably be introduced, and we can arrange them there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the short term, it is difficult for these people to gain trust. But after stretching the time to ten years, twenty years...the situation is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is the easiest to deceive people, continuous success is the easiest to get lost. When all luck is exhausted, the foundation will be overturned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The chaotic two counties suddenly fell silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noisy days have passed for a long time, and the sudden silence will always make people feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the two counties of Wyton and Wright have such a mentality at the moment. Fearing that this is the last peace before the storm, everyone lives in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some aristocratic lords who are weak and unable to withstand the toss have already started their activities, asking around to find out what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the influential figures, Master Hudson naturally has no shortage of guests here. Just want to ask about the development of the situation, it is obviously the wrong person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson was well prepared to meet the chaos. While actively expanding his armaments, he was easing relations with his opponents, and he did not forget to connect and pull people around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The preparations were well done, but the situation suddenly changed. The new Baron Cayo didn't know what was going on, and he just stood still while letting everyone fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this leader, the nobles who originally wanted revenge were naturally disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People speak lightly, no matter how disappointed they are, as losers, they don't have the capital to make a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tiger skin of the Dalton family can't be involved, and more local nobles can't be dragged into the water. Only their own strength and a group of northern Xinjiang nobles will only repeat the fiasco of last year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing once is bad enough, another toss, no one can stand it. As a last resort, he could only forcefully suppress the anger in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bystander, Hudson can only roughly infer the purpose of Baron Cayo in doing this. It is nothing more than kingdom politics, and it is inconvenient for the Dalton family to drive out the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles want to do it, and they are very supportive, but they can't participate in it in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves family interests and it is inconvenient to make a move, so we can only keep silent for now. After all, the play of small fights can't do anything to the nobles of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things, you just need to know. If it is revealed, it is making the Dalton family unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the back garden of my own home, a tentacle was stretched out by others. It was obvious that I was temporarily at a disadvantage in the high-level political struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this kind of bad news spreads, it will not only be embarrassing for the Dalton family, but it will also reduce their power over the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guys in Northern Xinjiang didn't publicize it to the outside world. It's not that they don't know. It's more likely that they are worried that the Dalton family will be caught off guard and will be hit by a thunderbolt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guys with backgrounds should restrain themselves. Hudson, who has no political backing, should be even more cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing everyone's anxious faces, Hudson was also helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship is good, give a reassuring look; if the relationship is average, send a few words of comfort at will, and then send them away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only so much you can do, whether you can understand the deep meaning depends on your ability. If the political mind is not bright enough, it can only be feared as it should be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, Baron Cayo-Dalton is visiting! He is in the living room at the moment, so hurry up and receive him!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the excited expression on the old butler's face, Hudson was speechless. Everyone's a baron, it's necessary to make it so...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I complained in my heart, I walked out physically and honestly. A baron is nothing, and Lord Hudson is also one of the most important figures among the barons in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when the baronet has \"Dalton\" in his surname, it becomes different. At least in the entire southeastern province, everyone has to save some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, people have taken the initiative to visit, and they must give enough face. Otherwise, if it gets out, it will be said that Hudson does not understand etiquette.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the person holding the magic wand, Hudson felt a bit like \"Li Gui met Li Kui\", and his intuition told him that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I've heard about Baron Cayo's name for a long time, and I'm sure he's very handsome when I saw him today. I was busy with the affairs of the territory a few days ago, so I didn't get to visit...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of excuses that he didn't even believe, Hudson felt hypocritical, but the enthusiasm on his face did not diminish in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other nobles, they went to visit Baron Cayo, it was to hug their thighs and flatter them. With a view to building a good relationship, you can get care in the days to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These hidden benefits are neither rare nor used by Hudson, so naturally there is no need to make yourself unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there are people, there is a circle, and now Hudson is also the leader of a small circle. When doing things, you must also consider the impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, going to visit Baron Cayo may be interpreted politically as bowing your head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this kind of thing must not be done. As the most famous existence among the local nobles, Hudson also has another duty-to check and balance Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not a question of willingness or not, but a group of local nobles want this kind of check and balance relationship to exist, and it is also what other noble factions in the province want to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there is no benefit on the surface, but there is definitely a lot of support that can be obtained secretly. At the very least, when something happens, someone can stand up and help speak out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the task is completed well, then at a suitable time point, someone will throw an olive branch, and there is a high probability that Hudson will join a certain noble faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the power of these aristocratic factions is slightly weaker, they can play a role in checking and balancing Dalton in the southeastern province. There must be someone in the central government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \" Baron Hudson is polite. I came here this time mainly to exchange magic. The great magician Camboy once said: Communication makes people progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic is not flourishing in the southeast province. Wright and Wyton counties, and there are only two magicians, you and me, so we will have to get close in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Baron Cayo's words, Hudson could only complain secretly. What should come will come after all, but I didn't expect it to come so soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson thought he was knowledgeable (after reading the books in his own collection), even if his professional knowledge was limited, he could fool around by rambling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of theoretical knowledge, there is a little flaw, and it can be pushed to the lack of systematic study.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the last time I communicated with Miss Melissa, I was fooled and learned a lot of basic common sense about magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't expect the slap in the face to come so quickly. \"Camboy\" - the greatest alchemist in the history of mankind, is known to all the nobles in the whole continent, and everyone knows it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But his own history book only emphasizes his contribution to alchemy, and doesn't mention magic at all. Never thought that this guy is actually a great magician.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sorrow of the little nobles, the ancestors accidentally recorded it, and what was left was a common-sense error.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Cayo is being polite. Compared with your orthodox mages, mages like me who rely on luck are far behind in all aspects of knowledge reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to exchange magic knowledge with you is a good learning opportunity for me, please don't hold it against me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't understand, you don't understand. Hudson keeps his posture very low. Although bears can be used to cheat, the magic concept of the Earth Bears does not mean that it is also applicable to humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least after staying together for so long, he didn't find that the cub had used a spell. When fighting, it is usually a slap in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic attacks have always appeared without God's knowledge or Hudson's awareness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is placed on the human race, if there is no spell, it would be a dream to cast magic so smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps a high-level magician can do it by casting low-level magic. But if you want to be like a cub, you can output all the magic you know at will, so let's go to sleep!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in talent cannot be made up by hard work. The same theory that applies to genius, in the hands of a fool, plays the harp to a beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Discussed the knowledge of magic, Baron Cayo pointed out the country with high spirits, and Hudson occasionally put forward an opinion, and then he was sprayed bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves a battle of ideas, which has never been warm. It was only a short conversation, and Hudson knew that there was also a fierce dispute of ideas among the magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can tell who is right and who is wrong. Anyway, everyone insists that their own ideas are correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no fight over ideas, mainly because there were too many factions of magic ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of different philosophies, I quarreled with this person today, and quarreled with another partner tomorrow. There are so many people who have quarreled, and I will gradually forget it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost every time a sanctuary mage is born, a new genre will be born, and there will never be any repetition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magisters and grand magisters below basically have their own magic concepts, and no one can convince anyone else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are masters and apprentices, when it comes to the concept of magic, they still disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different road non-phase plan. After each parting ways, a new magic concept was born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, before the magicians form their own ideas, they all listen to their teachers. Once they have their own ideas, then there is nothing to say—stand on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one thinks it's wrong. Since the birth of magic, everyone has been having so much fun!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the interior was too scattered to carry out effective integration, it wouldn't have been suppressed so badly by the Holy See hundreds of years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also because of the dispersion that magicians have received support from all countries in the mainland. How could the ruler not like a high-level thug who did not threaten his own core interests?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conversation lasted all morning, and even the lunch was brought by the servants, and was eliminated during the discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Cayo, we have discussed it for so long, but it is all theoretical. To judge whether it is correct or not, it still depends on the effect of the spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, let's change places and cast magic according to our own ideas, and see what the specific effect is? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be calm and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's great to be able to learn magic knowledge, but it's boring to be sprayed all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an in-depth discussion, it has to be conducted with the beautiful mage lady! The same mage, what is there to talk about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I heard that there is a swamp in Baron Hudson's territory. I just learned a reinforcement technique recently. How about trying the effect?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Baron Cayo's words, Hudson scolded himself for being stupid for actually believing that the other party came to discuss magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now he can't refuse, and the refusal to conceal it will only arouse deeper suspicions in the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't cover it up, then simply show it to the other party openly. Anyway, the progress of the development of the swamp is hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The open channel drainage that was first adopted failed within a month. The surrounding terrain is higher than the swamp, and after the dug ponds are filled with water, they can only give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result is not in vain, at least the pool water can raise fish. If there is a drought, there will be a few more water reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The progress of the bamboo and wood fence is not very smooth. The silt in the swamp is too deep. After excavating to a certain depth, landslides will occur on both sides, and great efforts must be made to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just took Baron Cayo to see the difficulty of swamp development and dispel the doubts of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, something is wrong! Lizards appeared in the swamp, and several slaves were accidentally dragged into the mud by them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving the bad news from the housekeeper, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but secretly happy. It's too late to explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traces of lizard beasts have been discovered long ago. It's just that the land reclamation team is only active in the edge of the swamp, and has never encountered it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't prepared in advance, they wouldn't just sacrifice a few orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Calm down the slave, I'll be there right away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson glanced at Baron Cayo, and gave up the choice of whether to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's go and have a look together! Lizard beasts are also a relatively rare magic material. If you can meet the Lizard King who became a monster, then this trip will be worthwhile.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the casualties of the slaves were directly ignored by Baron Cayo. The focus of his attention is only on whether he can harvest some magic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a bow and arrow on his back, a magic wand, and a knight sword at his waist, the weird combination of equipment, anyone can't help complaining about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson doesn't care. If it wasn't for the consideration that the lizard monster lives in the swamp and there is no room for a knight gun, a knight gun should be added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who has been on the battlefield knows that in the face of safety, demeanor is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just an ordinary lizard monster, it's okay, if a few monsters appear, don't prepare more equipment, and then do it, wouldn't it be a big loss?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that there was an extra crispy mage by my side, so I needed to slow down. Unexpectedly, the gentle and gentle Baron Cayo was actually a knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts once again proved that folk rumors are not credible. A pure mage's body is indeed relatively fragile, but no one stipulates that a mage cannot become a knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavaliers like Hudson can be transferred to a mage sub-class, and magicians can also be a knight sub-class. As long as the family has the resources, none of this is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the messy scene, Hudson was so angry that he untied his bow and arrow and greeted the playing lizards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrows shot out of the air, and the outcropping lizard beasts had an arrow mark on their foreheads. If you observe carefully, these arrows all pierced the throat from the skull.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Aw, ow...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a scream, and the lizard beast with tenacious vitality continued to struggle. The lizard beast companion who was awakened by the scream rolled over the mud and came towards Hudson, as if to avenge his companion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, be careful! These lizards are the most vengeful. Once they are stained, they will never die.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally reminded, Hudson was quite grateful. It's just that at some point, this guy has distanced himself from him, as if he was avoiding the plague god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a group of beasts, how fierce can it be, as for being so timid? Even if you want to dodge people, you have to wait for the monsters to appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tucao return to Tucao, Hudson still performed a unique trick - release the bear!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Swamp is also land, as long as it is on the ground, it is the home ground of the Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Woke up from sleep, the cub rubbed his two big eyes with his paw, glared at Hudson dissatisfied, and then transformed into a three-meter-high giant bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It rushed directly into the swamp, facing the charging lizards one by one, without any pause, as if they were dancing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the crackling sound of broken bones coming from the swamp, I'm afraid they wouldn't have known it was a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him not only shocked Baron Cayo who was about to cast a spell, but even Hudson was shocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is easy to know that the cub is bullying the lizard, which is not even a monster, it is too easy in front of it. After all, it was a huge beast weighing hundreds of pounds, and it didn't even have room to struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A huge figure appeared faintly in the distance, like a lizard beast king. It's just that this guy just turned around and ran away as soon as he showed up, without any thought of revenge for the lizard boys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who played the head-stomping game, seemed to be addicted, and continued to kick the lizard beast one by one, without any thought of chasing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kayo on the side is eager to try, but looking at the endless swamp in front of him, he really dare not take a step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bear can gallop in the swamp because of talent. Humans don't have racial talent, and the result of rashly rushing in is the question of how long they can struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, it's a pity to let the Beastmaster go like this! Now let the Earth Bear chase it, there should be time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Baron Kayo's encouragement, Hudson pretended to be calm and replied: \"It's useless, this lizard beast king is too vigilant. When he found something wrong, he immediately ran away without pausing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swamp is its home field, and the speed is far beyond our imagination. Missed the best time, and now it is difficult to catch up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for next time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you live in this swamp, you will meet again sooner or later. If this beast is caught, I will send someone to notify you as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can capture a lizard beast king, Hudson is also very happy. Buyers are all ready-made, and as far as the importance of Baron Cayo is concerned, there is no need to worry about not being able to sell for a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that Uncle Xiong, who is addicted to playing, loves to play, and the bear's head turns, which is not bad at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling the Lizard Beastmaster in front of it, and Hudson wants to make a difference from it, that is simply insulting the bear's IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although everyone is hundreds of meters apart now, this distance does not affect Uncle Xiong's eavesdropping in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make the price difference is just a small problem, and Master Hudson is not a person who is short of three melons and two dates. But a bear in debt and a bear without debt are two completely different states.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Bear Stearns, although he has been avoiding the debt problem, can eat people with a short mouth after all. In the face of Hudson's orders, complaining is nothing but complaints, but it is still done well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this guy turns over, if you want Uncle Xiong to do something again, it depends on your mood. After all, this is an extremely lazy bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can sit, never stand; can lie down, never sit. There are only two daily hobbies: eating and sleeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when you have eaten enough and slept enough, will you come out for activities. This time is usually no more than two hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    work?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too embarrassing for the lazy Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the huge debts and worrying that the **** shovel officer would cut off its support, Uncle Xiong wouldn't be as easy to talk to as he is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay then! If Baron Hudson captures the Lizard Beastmaster, please contact me immediately regardless of life or death. You can rest assured that the reward will definitely not make you suffer!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo said regretfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking Warcraft as an experiment is not something that a little mage like him can play with. Willing to spend a lot of money to buy the lizard beast king, it is because a magister in the magic academy is asking for this thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if it's money or not, the key is favor. As long as he can get a favor with that magister and buy the money for the monster, the Dalton family will reimburse him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These connections are useless to a large family, but they are really useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no one is short of one or two strong players. But when the time comes, it will be too late to make a relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make connections, not for fighting. In other aspects, we also have the possibility of cooperation. For example: exploring ruins, interpreting hidden ancient texts, customizing some special magic circles...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After being salvaged, all of them were wholesaled to Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can play magic, none of them are poor ghosts, and some are capital toss. Magic materials have never been short of sales.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than forty lizards were sold for 800 gold coins, and Hudson was very satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Baron Kayo hadn't happened to appear, these ugly, foul-smelling monsters would most likely enter the stomachs of orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I forgot to ask Bear Stearns to keep the live ones. According to Baron Cayo, the price of live lizards can triple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be sold at such a price, mainly because the swamp is a restricted area for humans. Even if you organize people to go deep into the swamp, it will be difficult to pull these guys out from the depths of the quagmire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extravagant magical research, Hudson has no interest in participating. If you have this spare time, you might as well learn bear magic from Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Does not require instant casting of spells, which is much more efficient than human magic. Anyway, they are all open and hung, so naturally they should be opened a little bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is not too young, with this instant magic, he can go out and pretend to be a magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What restricts the improvement of Hudson's spellcasting level is mainly the lack of mental power. The magic power can be cheated, but the spiritual power is your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, if you don't have enough mental power to control the magic power, you can forcefully release more powerful magic, but you need to bear the backlash caused by the out-of-control magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is timid, since he accidentally burned his clothes when he released Mantian Huowu last time, he stopped all attempts to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Man Tian Huo Wu's level is not high. If the unknown learner releases the forbidden spell, it is estimated that he will become \"another\" person who killed himself by playing magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mental power of an intermediate magician, then the intermediate magician is fine. There is only one life, there is no need to risk your own life just to pretend to be aggressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Intermediate knight + intermediate magician + sharpshooter\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such strength, Hudson can be regarded as the top-notch genius among his peers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not no more powerful geniuses, but they all exist in myths and legends. In the real world, there is still a bit of \"logic\" to be said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the talent is, it will take time to accumulate in order to transform it into strength. The strong are honed in blood and fire, and the flowers in the greenhouse cannot withstand the wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off Baron Cayo, Hudson secretly calculated the gains and losses of this meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of land reclamation cannot be kept secret, and if it is exposed, it will be exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family has no shortage of land, and the tens of thousands of acres of mountainous land are not in the eyes of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is just a plan to increase food production, which must be temporarily interrupted. Especially the land in the plain area, the marsh brand fertilizer can no longer be used in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the bumper grain harvest in one year is accidental. Every year, grain production has increased greatly, which cannot be explained by chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as people with a heart continue to pay attention, they will eventually increase food production and connect with Marsh brand fertilizers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the newly opened mountainous areas can be used continuously. As long as the amount is limited and the grain production is slightly lower than that in the plain areas, there will be no major problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land in the hilly area is not static, and the soil quality is different in different regions. If fertile soil happened to be developed, then the grain output would be a little lower than that of the plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps we should plant more crops such as soybeans, flax, potatoes, etc. that do not pick the ground. Even if it is charged a little more, it will not arouse suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what crops are planted, they will not be wasted. In the huge mountainous land, except for Hudson, the lord who is qualified to be picky eaters, everyone else eats whatever they want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Potatoes serve as a staple food, and it's no big deal. As long as you can fill your stomach, it's not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more vegetable oil, the better. Whether increasing the oil and water in the stomachs of the residents, or processing soap, they are all oil-consuming, and no amount of soybeans can be consumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the residue left over from oil extraction can be fed to livestock, and some orc races with good stomachs can digest it without any waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grasp the speed of it, even if it is spread, people will only lament that Baron Hudson is lucky, and he can encounter fertile soil even when opening up wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people found the use of swamp mud, it can also be inferred that the newly reclaimed wasteland soil layer is too thin and needs to be thickened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the rest of the content, someone will naturally help to make up the brain. Even if there are some unreasonable things, others will find ways to help rationalize them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the \"good luck\" hat is easy to envy and hate, the benefits brought by this thing are also amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing many things, everyone will get used to it. No matter what good things happen, if Hudson meets him, everyone will feel normal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't believe it, go back and look through the history books left by your ancestors. The above \"legendary characters\" started their careers, each one is more magical than the other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, Hudson has deliberately deepened the imprint of \"good luck\", which has caused many people to attribute his success to luck and prevented many unnecessary troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to ask for trouble. When encountering a particularly lucky guy, even if a normal person does not take the initiative to make friends, he will not deliberately offend him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Baron Cayo is a magician, and the focus of his attention is always involuntarily associated with magic, and he is not interested in the worldly level of technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if you go to participate in the steelmaking furnace, the biggest secret of the mountain leader will be exposed. For a long time to come, the mining area will be the most important industry in the mountainous area, and the technology must not be leaked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are still too few talents, not even one who can discuss major issues. Even if Hudson mobilized all his contacts and asked everyone to help search for some management talents, it still had little effect in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truly talented people are basically monopolized by the big nobles. Occasionally a few are born, and that is also among the noble children. Unless the family completely declines, it will not be able to dig at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core reason is that mountainous areas are not attractive enough to talents. With Hudson's current family background, it is not as useful as the \"good luck\" hat on his head if he wants to recruit talents to join him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Good luck is a prerequisite for a successful counterattack by the bottom nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For those down-and-out aristocratic children who are in a desperate situation and want to turn against the wind, it is also a good choice to choose potential stocks that have not yet appeared to bet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kayo, who was on the road with a group of lizard corpses, turned gloomy as soon as he left the mountain territory. It's as if the previous happy conversations were all intentional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, but what's wrong?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accompanying butler asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although acting is the basic skill of nobles, there are not many times when such hard work is required. In theory, Hudson, who is in the stage of primitive accumulation of capital, should not be worthy of his treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's nothing, it's just that someone put it together, and I feel a little uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Baron Hudson is not simple, we have to re-evaluate, his real ability is much more terrifying than the data.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After returning, send someone to tell the earl: I suspect that the earth bear is about to reach adulthood, or has already grown up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ability and luck coexist, this kind of existence is not easy to deal with. From now on, raise the level of attention to the Mountain Territory to the highest level, and focus on this person's suspicious behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, place as many spies as possible in the mountains, so that he cannot escape our sight. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    seeing is believing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After personal contact, he discovered that the description in the information was not only not exaggerated, but even underestimated in some places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The basic skills of dealing with people and dealing with others seem very simple, but not many people can use them freely before being honed by society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this trip to the Mountain Territory, it seemed that he saw everything, but Baron Cayo actually saw nothing of value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything that comes into contact with is what the other party wants him to see. There are many difficulties in opening up wasteland, the development of swampland is dangerous, and road construction is difficult...all of them are difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary people are likely to be fooled, but after experiencing the baptism of the old foxes in the capital, Baron Cayo is no longer a simple youth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is difficult, why should we spend a lot of money to develop it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The manpower, material resources, and financial resources consumed by the development of the territory were invested in the battle for the county guards, and the mountain leaders had long suppressed the Sith Baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before knowing that the position of sheriff is determined by default, normal people will choose the position of sheriff who can see benefits in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development of the territory should be done slowly, anyway, where the land is lying, it will not be able to run with long legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of abnormalities fell into the eyes of Baron Cayo, and he came to a conclusion: Hudson predicted in advance that the battle for the sheriff would fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any specific information, only based on the apparent political situation of the kingdom, one can predict the outcome of the game of all parties and the final decision of the king's capital. How can this be a political novice?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including that Hudson did not let the bear hunt down the lizard beast king, it also fell into his eyes: restraining desires and being good at hiding one's own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is full of strengths all over his body. If he becomes an enemy, it must be the most terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the southeast province, it is natural to be vigilant when such a person appears in his sphere of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, there is no need to worry too much. In fact, the Earl has already made arrangements. Next, we can send him to Qingyun, and we can also push him down the cliff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a pawn, if you don't have any strength, how can you destroy the Felix family's plan for us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County is still too small after all, even if this Baron Hudson has seen through everything, he has to fight with that Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are able to exercise restraint, it is just your presence that makes them feel the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The calm is temporary. When the young master's plan in Wyton County is launched, they will definitely take the opportunity to decide a winner. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf leader, Baron Kettley felt his scalp tingling when he saw the crowd of creditors approaching menacingly. It seems that this business is really not easy to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he still failed to show the aura of being a master in debt. Kettley could only smile and cry while explaining how difficult it is to sell orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the opposite is a group of slave traders. People who do this kind of unconscionable business can have everything, but they can't have sympathy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, it's almost over. We generally understand who you are. It's useless to perform these things, who do you want to fool!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there wasn't enough benefit, would you take the deal?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he accepted the deal, he naturally had to bear the risks involved. No matter whether you use the slaves for your own use or sell them, the agreed amount cannot be less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to play tricks on me here, you don't have to give me money. For the sake of your father, as long as one arm is removed, I will let you go. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged man's grinning words made Keitele feel as if he had fallen into an ice cave. A creditor asked him for an arm, and with so many creditors in front of him, wouldn't it be necessary to remove all the parts from his body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these guys are not the masters of joking. If you say you want to remove an arm, you will really remove the arm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for his father's face, it does play a role. But the premise is that it cannot involve interests, otherwise the face of a nodding acquaintance will not be enough at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Roman Knight, my arm is not worth that much money. You have been busy and ventured deep into the Orc Empire to catch slaves. You have paid such a high price, you can't just give it a sigh of relief, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I can't pay in cash, what I used to cover my debts were ironware. These things are hard goods no matter where they are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you transport things back to the Northland, whether you keep them at home for your own use or take them out for sale, you don't have to worry about throwing them into your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the quantity is a bit large, it can still be smuggled to the Orc Empire. I've been there too, so I know how profitable it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't do such a profitable business, if you want to take off one of my arms, this business will be a big loss. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smuggling iron products to the orc empire is indeed profitable enough, but the hidden risks are directly proportional to the profits that can be reaped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom may not care about the smuggling of some ordinary commodities, but the supervision of strategic materials such as ironware still exists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once caught, not to mention implicating the whole family to die together, the participants will definitely be cool anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"So, we still have to thank you for your care?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it's all about taking care of, then you should just take care of it to the end!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You personally **** these iron artifacts into the Orc Empire, and give us the profits in return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, we won't treat you badly, and you will get a share of the increased profits. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Roman Knight said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Roman is right. Kettley, you want to take care of us so much, so please go and take care of us yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry, we will help take care of your territory. During your days out, there is absolutely no chance of chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to doing business, you are still a skinny beast. Even if you leave the Northland, you still have your name in the Beastman Empire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eagle-eyed old man on the side made up the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the word \"Skinless Beast\", Baron Kettley just wanted to cry. Didn't he just save a little bit, so he was given this title by a group of unscrupulous guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks like a profiteer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that he, Ketley, does business in the Orc Empire, and it has always been a business without capital. Completely followed the rules, never had a…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Purple Mountain Knight, this joke is not funny. If I were to take these iron weapons deep into the orc empire, I am afraid that everyone will really have nothing to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many tribes on the border of the orcs, which one doesn't have my arrest warrant?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is really door-to-door business, I am afraid people will not believe it. If you fight on someone else's territory, it will be difficult to get out of your body. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by youth and ignorance. In order to complete the primitive accumulation in the orc empire as soon as possible, Baron Kettley resorted to cruel means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlucky, and offended someone who shouldn't be offended. Going south this time is not only to seek a piece of foundation, but also to avoid disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, you two don't tease him. Look, scare our skinning beast, as if we are going to skin him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come on, Kettley. As long as you introduce the mountain baron who provided the goods to us, and help us broker a big business, we will accept the goods. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A gentle voice sounded, and the cold sweat broke out on Baron Kettley's forehead. Obviously, the man who spoke now is the most terrifying existence among the creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Longxi, I can introduce the Mountain Baron to you. But I can't guarantee whether the next business can be negotiated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This guy is difficult to deal with, he only has interests in his eyes, and I am not very familiar with him, so I cannot influence his decision...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you don't know each other well, can you cooperate so many times? If you don't have a good relationship, can he help you pick up that batch of garbage at a par price?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately, you should know that I hate cheating the most. Things have come to this point, you kid don't want to play tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    contributed to this big deal, then hello, hello, hello everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case you screw up this deal, I can guarantee you kid will regret coming into this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't blame us for being ruthless, it's really you who delivered it to your door. If it weren't for your greedy brat, you wouldn't be in this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was prepared for you to run away and collect debts from your father, but I didn't expect that you still have a bit of luck, and you can still survive checkmates! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Longxi's words completely cut off Ketley's thoughts of struggling. After working for a long time, people are already prepared, but he is just a pawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling that before he came up with the idea of ​​monopolizing orc slaves, it seems that he heard people say more than once: how does monopoly business make money, and how high the price of human slaves is...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time I heard it by accident, I thought it was a coincidence, but now it seems that it was arranged by others, just waiting for him to fall into the trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he was blinded by the interests at the time, thinking that as long as he monopolized the orc slaves, he would not worry about making a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the constant persuasion of the cronies around him, he didn't care about it, and directly gambled all his wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In retrospect, how stupid that was. Actually only saw benefits, even the word \"risk\" was ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have come to this point, it's too late to regret. The other party has set up such a big game, it is obviously impossible for him to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Longxi, Kettley doesn't know what he can do, but he is honored to trouble you so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you just want to make a deal with the Mountain Baron, you can go directly to him. As far as I know, that guy will dare to do any business as long as he has enough money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    like…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Kettler finished speaking, Long Xi interrupted: \"Alright kid, don't waste time probing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The layout is specially for you, your face is too big. It's just an idle move, you kid jumped into it by yourself because of greed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the mountain baron is much smarter. Seemingly greedy, but always sticking to the bottom line. If you don't deserve your own profits, people can resist not earning a penny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Designed that guy several times, but unfortunately they all avoided him. Now I don't have time to continue, so I can only find you, a guy with a little connection, as a middleman. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

One of the important means is to reduce the expenses in all aspects and reduce the number of banquets held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was the first time Hudson hosted a banquet, the number of guests attending the banquet was still small. It's not that there is a lack of people attending the banquet, the main reason is that Hudson only invited the twenty or so people in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without exception, all of them are not far away, and have some kind of friendship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An accident happened, and everyone can take care of each other. Mutual benefit is the core reason for the establishment of this emerging interest group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is in a good mood, and several friends have recommended talents to him. Although the timing was too coincidental, Master Hudson, who was seriously short of people, couldn't care less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more people and more things. Compared with other village chief lords with only a thousand people, the mountain leader is still the size of a big town.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a large town with a population of tens of thousands, there are only seven managers, all of whom are borrowed from outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small number of people, Hudson can maintain the normal operation of the territory, and Hudson admires his management ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that with the continuous development of the territory, there are more and more specific things that need to be planned and managed, and the number of people becomes insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson didn't cultivate talents by himself. The following chiefs and security chiefs are the “key talents” he cultivated painstakingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy for a group of purely illiterate people to do a good job at the grassroots level. It is obviously unrealistic to expect them to grow up immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited cronies must also be placed in the army. Compared with administrative management, Hudson still pays more attention to the control of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This can be seen from the talents recruited. All the targets were administrative personnel, and no matter how talented the military commanders were, Master Hudson would not dare to use them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are not many history books in the family, some experiences and lessons are still recorded. Countless heroes have failed in starting their own businesses, and the reason behind them is the betrayal of their subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In troubled times, the army is the lifeline. The army is not chaotic, and everything has room for maneuver. Once there is a problem with the army, it can only rely on the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ability can be cultivated slowly, but loyalty must not be compromised. Anyway, there are only so few soldiers in total, as long as they can execute orders without compromise, that's enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to military command ability, Hudson feels that his level of \"talking about soldiers on paper\" ranks high among a group of colleagues who only know how to charge stupidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go to the battlefield a few more times and accumulate some actual combat experience, you might become a famous general in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He can only lead troops to charge in a stupid way. Hudson feels that recruiting these guys into the army is irresponsible to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the down-and-out aristocrats living abroad, there may be outstanding military talents, but Hudson doesn't think that he, a little baron, can recruit these great gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is easy to recruit administrators. As long as they have the level of those housekeepers, they can make do with it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, there will be more suitable candidates for replacement. If there are not enough talents, then wait until the elderly officers in the army retire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made Master Hudson afraid to promote compulsory education in the territory, so he could only secretly teach some officers to read and write in the army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of knowledge dissemination, a tacit agreement has been reached within the aristocratic group, which only allows circulation in a small area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only serfs have no chance to learn knowledge, but also free people outside. Including many businessmen, also illiterate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the worst. As far as Hudson knows, some down-and-out aristocratic lords have also become illiterate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no one to help, if you want to regain knowledge, you will have to pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, do you really want to fight the Sith?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian Knight deliberate question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether to support or not. They belong to the same family. On this issue, Adrian was divided into camps from the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising his glass and taking a sip, Hudson said with great enjoyment, \"Whether you want to fight with him or not is actually not about me, but whether everyone needs me to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being pushed all the way to the present, it is no longer possible for me to quit just by saying quit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farce in Wright County, this is a small episode in the big screen, and there must be more good dramas behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to be overturned by the storm, then find a way to increase your strength!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much time left for us, and we will try to accumulate as much as possible before the storm comes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The further you get to the back, the lower the voice, even if the people nearby are considered \"our own people\", there are some words that Hudson still dare not say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This meeting seemed to be just an ordinary exchange, but in fact it was the formation of a new interest group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the group looks weak, Wright County is already considered a big force. Excluding other influences, it has barely been able to compete with the northern nobles in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What a **** life!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know whether to envy you or pity you. But it can be seen that you are enjoying everything now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So can I understand that you are ready to deal with Baron Sith, or you have found a way to intervene in the face of the Felix family? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian Knight looking forward to the question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing on the standpoint of the Koslow family, I naturally hope that Hudson can win this dispute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Hudson seizes the position of sheriff and with the support of all the family lines, it won't take long for Hudson to gain a firm foothold among the middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking this step, the Koslow family can be regarded as the number one in the southeastern province. Even if you look at the entire kingdom, you have the most basic right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The threshold for the kingdom's noble council is to start with a viscount, and you must have real power to be eligible to join.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the right to speak is actually limited, nominally this is the highest authority of the Alpha Kingdom, capable of making decisions about the kingdom's major affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct manifestation is that the safety is more secure. In case of being suppressed by the big nobles, you can still shout twice in the Kingdom Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is uncertain how much it can play, but as long as things are brought to the table, many things must be done according to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why the Dalton family, although powerful, cannot cover the sky with one hand in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't guess, I didn't say these words. If it spreads out and causes any bad influence, I won't admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is only one thing I want to do, and that is to continuously enhance my own strength. Don't expect anything else, as long as the training of these two infantry regiments is completed, do you think it is important who is the county guard? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidence is all compared. The weakness of his colleagues made Hudson more and more confident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What about strategizing, strategic layout... It's all nonsense. Most noble lords don't have any plans, just like ordinary people, they are purely day-to-day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The teammates selected by Hudson are basically this kind of stuff, and Adrian Cavaliers is considered the most thoughtful among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those powerful characters are unfortunately not within the scope of Master Hudson's wooing. To put it simply, don't take them to play together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ability is not equal to strength. Before completing the original accumulation, no matter how awesome a guy is, he is no different from an ordinary person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put them out of the circle and don't give them the opportunity to complete primitive accumulation. The general trend will soon teach them how to behave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in Wright County is still unclear, but the pattern of confrontation between the two powers in Wright County is already very obvious. Whoever wants to become the third pole will be jointly attacked by the two major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has observed a moment of silence for the Baron Ezekiel. The ability is indeed very good, but it is a pity that his own strength cannot support his ambition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a grassroots tragedy. If you don't give it a go, it is estimated that everyone will not know that there is someone like him in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Painful planning, careful preparation, and dozens of times of effort, choosing the most appropriate time to give it a go, but in the end it was inevitable that he would be \"destroyed ten times with one force\" by Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All calculations outside the battlefield are all victories, and all battles on the battlefield are all defeats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strenuous resistance just made the story more tragic. Perhaps wandering poets love tragic heroes, but the aristocratic world does not sympathize with losers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, Hudson is much more wretched. In the early stage, he knew that his strength was not enough, so he stayed in the territory and ignored the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only big thing he did was trying to brag. Instead of going out to blow it out by yourself, but with the help of former colleagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stories of \"true and false, false and true\" are interspersed together, but they have deceived many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until the initial accumulation was completed and fame turned into strength that he slowly moved to the foreground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the two infantry regiments cannot fight, but this does not affect the eyes of the outside world, these two infantry regiments are elite divisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People always like to believe what their eyes see, so Hudson let everyone see \"two elite infantry regiments\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, how can the aristocratic gentlemen who are high above care about the transfer of personnel below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first troupe has performed a long time ago, and now it is the second troupe that often shows up outside. In everyone's inherent cognition, the first group formed last year is more powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As everyone knows, Hudson just played a word game. The current first regiment is the recruit regiment. Except for a small number of personnel changes in the second regiment outside, 90% of the soldiers are from the original first regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first regiment nests deep in the territory every day, conducting military training while guarding the orc slaves at work. They will not show up until they have trained a famous figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once again, the bluff succeeded, directly establishing the confrontation between the two strong teams in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson didn't have two \"elite infantry regiments\" in his hands, the group of allies in the hall alone would not be able to compete with the northern nobles in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to have such a good time, the biggest reason is naturally the tacit understanding reached with Baron Sith. Anyway, it's all a war of words, whoever coaxes who is the grandson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if something is wrong, Hudson doesn't think Baron Sith dares to take risks. Who made him an illegitimate child?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of a wrong judgment, it will be a direct blow to both sides. Even if Grand Duke Kavadia loves his son and wants to increase investment, his half-brothers and sisters will work hard to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Banquet, unprecedented success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the guests who witnessed Hudson's military strength with their own eyes, the confidence that had been blown away by the group of Northern Xinjiang seemed to be regained overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone believes that as long as everyone unites, they will have the strength to oppose the northern nobles in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although with the addition of Wyton County, the local nobles are still at a disadvantage. But that doesn't matter, there is a baron from the Dalton family on the opposite side?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within the family's sphere of influence, any support from the family would be enough to turn things around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the aristocrats who were forced to change their land before, they had accumulated a lot of anger and wanted to let it out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rush directly, everyone is not so impulsive, but the confidence to speak louder is still there all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Longxi, you see that the Mountain Baron doesn't even invite me to a banquet. I really have no status as a neighbor on his side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, you can find an entry point from other places, find a nobleman who has weight in his mind as a lobbyist, maybe the effect will be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When things came to an end, Baron Kettley, who was unwilling to be reduced to a pawn, struggled with his last effort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he doesn't know what kind of big business it is, based on his understanding of this group of people, it is definitely not a serious business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting involved in it would definitely do him a lot of harm, but not a single benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case you know something you shouldn't know, it's not impossible to be silenced by these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's enough boy, lead the way honestly. Say one more nonsense, and I'll break your third leg first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a good thing you have the face to say it. We have been neighbors for less than half a year, and we have done business with each other several times, but I can't even get a banquet invitation, I feel ashamed for you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi reprimanded indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first I thought it was an important chess piece, but I didn't expect to find out that it was actually a useless chess piece.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looked like a \"car\", and after picking it up for a closer look, it turned out that it was a \"pawn\" faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the murderous eyes of everyone, Kelette bit his head and led a group of people into the mountain area. All the bitterness and tears in my heart can only be swallowed in my stomach alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the living room, the atmosphere was suddenly suppressed to the extreme, as if the sky was about to fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The visitor is a customer. I thought that Kelette brought a group of people over to discuss the delivery of the goods, but Hudson entertained them very warmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after a brief contact, he soon discovered that this was not the case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially Baron Kelette, who seemed to be serving his ancestors at the moment, followed a man in purple carefully, which made him realize that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear guests, you are not like me from the southeast. I don't know what you are here for?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending to be surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Baron Kelette, he was directly ignored by Hudson from his wonderful performance at the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that what he brought this time was not business, but trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone \"has no grievances in the past, and no grievances in the near future\", and Hudson can't figure out what troubles will come to him at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Koslow family had been in the North, it was hundreds of years ago. No matter how much hatred can be drawn, it won't be a hundred years before someone sends someone to retaliate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you're being polite, so many of us came here today to bother you, mainly because we want to negotiate a big deal with you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A big deal of more than 300,000 gold coins, as long as this order is completed, all the economic difficulties you are facing now will be solved. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what the man in purple said, Hudson's face instantly became ugly. The news that he was heavily in debt spread from the southeast province to the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without thinking about it, he knew that someone had leaked the secret, and gave Baron Kelette a hard look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the dozen or so people present, he was the only one who knew the news, and he happened to know the news that the mountain leader was heavily in debt, so he was the number one suspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three hundred thousand gold coins is indeed a big deal. It's just that such a good deal, why can it be cheaper for me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only things that the mountain leaders can afford are ironware.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, whether it is iron production capacity or iron quality, they are not ranked high. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really likes big business, but it's all serious business. Although he also took over such transactions with unknown origins, they were all small orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are some problems, the overall risk is still controllable. The situation is obviously different this time. The large order of 300,000 gold coins is estimated to cause a big commotion as soon as the order is delivered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few people staring at the Mountain Territory. Hudson doesn't think he can complete this huge deal without knowing it, under the eyes of a group of interested people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, don't get too excited. It's normal for you to worry about risks when you encounter such a big business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for finding you is very simple, we need to order a large number of weapons. Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, the weapons produced in the mountainous region are of the worst quality! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing this explanation, Hudson almost spat out a mouthful of old blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you meet, you will reveal your shortcomings. Can you still communicate happily?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it because he doesn't want to sell good weapons?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just dare not!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously better quality iron can be produced, but for the sake of safety, Master Hudson still chooses to earn a little less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for his selfless dedication, it would be a dream for all the serf soldiers in the southeastern province to use iron weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without weapons, how can you realize your dreams of gold and iron horses?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is important to know that serf soldiers were excluded from the previous fighting with weapons. Even if there is participation, it can only be regarded as a gang fight at best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ask for tickets at the end of the month! !\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I dare not expect extravagant rankings, as long as I can see it at a glance on the monthly ticket list of new books. Please readers, I love you Haiyue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But reason tells Hudson that he should restrain himself when it is time to restrain himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case these guys use these weapons to make a big deal, and the kingdom finds out that it was sold by the mountain leader, it may not be reasonable for the big man to vent his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, don't rush to refuse. Since ancient times, if you want to make huge profits, there is no one who does not take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency only needs to sell the weapon to Baron Kelette. You and us don't have to know each other at all, or we have never met. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a better choice, Long Xi doesn't want to go all the way to the southeast province to make this deal. In fact, most of the weapons production in the kingdom is in the hands of big forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are a lot of iron ore scattered in the hands of small and medium-sized nobles, the production capacity is extremely limited. Even if there are occasional large mines, no one dares to get involved in the arms business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, purely an alternative. In addition to the original munitions, a hole was torn again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the poor quality, it seems that the arms business in the Mountain Territory is booming, but it has little impact on the traditional weapons market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serf soldiers can use it because they have weak physical strength and do not have high performance requirements for weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a knight charged into battle with an inferior weapon produced by a mountain leader, he would definitely be irresponsible for his own life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One violent collision may cause gaps and cracks, and after a few more rounds of confrontation, it will be scrapped directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arms trade in the mountainous region has been able to continue until now without deeply touching the interests of vested interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So that now in the Alpha Kingdom, apart from those big forces, the only one that has mass-produced weapons and equipment is Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm sorry, this kind of business is not something I can accept. If you really want to buy it, you'd better find those companies!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred thousand gold coins is a huge deal for me. On their side, it was just an ordinary transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An accident happened, and they were able to handle it. Unlike my small body, I have to think twice before buying or selling more than 3,000 gold coins. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has never been able to resist a profitable business. An order of 300,000 gold coins if you can move, he is really cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone is willing to split into small orders, Hudson doesn't mind taking a share of it. The production capacity of the mining area is still expanding, and a few small orders are completed secretly, and they can still cover up the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those engaged in this kind of business must pay great attention to confidentiality work, and the possibility of exposure in a short period of time is unlikely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future has been discovered, and Baron Kelette is also responsible for that. For a small order of a few thousand gold coins, it is completely reasonable not to trace the identity of the buyer behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since your Excellency is so worried, let's consider it an order of 3,000 gold coins. If there are 100 orders like this, how long will it take Baron Hudson to complete it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi asked blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you split it, you will split it. At worst, arrange more vests. As long as the goal can be achieved, he doesn't care how the transaction is carried out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One year!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is the most ideal state. If there is a year with a lot of rain, the construction period may be delayed to one and a half years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering other factors, the actual construction period will be longer. In order not to cause unnecessary complications, this order may take three to five years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in a hurry and don't want to cause trouble, I suggest you split the order into small pieces and place orders with different suppliers at the same time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pushing out the orders for home delivery, and being able to consider this for customers, Hudson himself was almost moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he can't do it alone, but his reason tells him that it's better not to eat alone for such a big business with unknown origin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the arms dealers in the kingdom have a share, it means that all major forces have been dragged into the water. No matter how big the trouble is, no one dares to make a blind comparison on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too slow, can you speed up? If Baron Hudson can complete the order within half a year, we can give you an additional 10,000 slaves...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Long Xi finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Unfortunately, this is an impossible task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to cast so many weapons within half a year, you have to gather all the iron ore in the southeastern province, and I don't have the ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, it is impossible for any weapon manufacturer to produce so many weapons and equipment within half a year. Unless you have the ability to persuade several companies to join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the slave giveaway, that's not needed. There is no shortage of labor in the mountain collars, and only cash transactions are accepted. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson's tone gradually became cold. From the secretive behavior of the people, it can be seen that there is definitely something wrong with this transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern accent + huge purchase orders for weapons, but also choose low-quality weapons to buy. With such an obvious flaw, I almost told him directly, does anyone want to do something in northern Xinjiang?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why, in such a hurry?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delay for ten or twenty years, and when Master Hudson is ready, come over to discuss this deal without any hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting now, Hudson is not sure of getting out. Under the general trend, the weak mountain leader simply cannot withstand the impact of the huge waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words are not speculative, half a sentence is too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing the purpose of the visitor, the following negotiations soon ended in a disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one point, Hudson had the idea of ​​reporting these guys, but he finally suppressed it. If there is no benevolence and righteousness in business, how can we do such unrighteous things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way back, Baron Kelette's legs were shaking constantly. He would prefer to be led in the mountains if possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson is annoying, these guys obviously haven't had time to infiltrate the newly rising mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike the unlucky guy like him, his subordinates buried so many nails, and they were obviously in their own territory, so they didn't have the confidence to turn against these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by youth and recklessness. If I had kept a low profile and done fewer major things when I was in the Northland, I would not have been targeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, kid. Don't expect to pretend to be a fool in front of me, just try to fool me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that things are not done, the original agreement will naturally be voided. You are given two options:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either join us to overthrow this dark order and shape an era that belongs to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or you can solve it yourself, save us from doing it, you can't bear the pain. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from that sharp gaze that he wants to kill someone at this moment. Although killing a nobleman would cause a lot of trouble, it was nothing compared to what they were going to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are chaos...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the words came to his lips, Baron Kelette swallowed them back hastily. Under the murderous eyes of everyone, he quickly remedied: \"I'll join!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who walk on the edge of life and death know the value of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the great cause of this mysterious organization in front of me seems to have no \"bright\" future at first glance, at least it can still be alive now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the future, that is something that living people need to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Very well, I like smart people the most. I believe you will not do stupid things, but the process still has to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Voting the certificate is very simple. I don't care if you steal, rob, or buy. In short, according to the above requirements, one-third of the armaments will be raised within half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can reimburse you the expenses, but the task must be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will be rewarded and punished in July, and I will be rewarded for overfulfilling the task. Many rare things on the market can be exchanged within the organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should have heard about the consequences of failing to complete the task! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi laughed loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The face-changing speed was so fast, as if it was a different person. Just thinking of this person's nickname of \"Laughing Lion\", Kelette couldn't be happy, and immediately asked tentatively:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, let the mountain leader let it go?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rumors about the mysterious organization \"July Meeting\" are very familiar to Kelette. It is said that once they are targeted by this organization, they will never give up until they achieve their goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the great nobles are afraid of this mysterious organization. It's not that they can't beat these guys, the main reason is that they hide too deeply and no one knows their true identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like now, if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Baron Kelette would not have believed that a group of slave traders were actually members of this organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that these guys are not without background, they are all the children of nobles in the Northland. According to common sense, it is impossible for them to join an evil organization that tries to subvert the rule of the aristocracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't let it go, what else can I do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lead people to kill them and kill them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just the few soldiers under your command are not enough for others to fight!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, this guy is also a smart person. He seemed to reject us, but actually gave us an idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was a bit troublesome, I could still get things together by scraping around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not necessary to purchase weapons directly, it is also fine to buy some pig iron and go back to arrange manual forging. Anyway, it is for those animals, so there is no need to consider the quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he doesn't report it, the relationship will continue to be maintained, and it may be useful at some point. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi said rather apprehensively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is not the Northland, not their home field. Baron Kelette was mainly intimidated by their prestige in the Northland, and was bluffed for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they really turned their faces directly, they might not be able to please the three hundred elite soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to deal with stronger mountain leaders, it will be even more troublesome. If the July Society has the ability to mobilize its troops to wipe out the mountainous territory quietly, then there is no need to hide in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, since Hudson sent away the uninvited guests, Hudson has stepped up the guard in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to extensive drills on the two standing regiments, they often use Baojia as a unit to transfer young and strong for military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For these reserve forces, Hudson adopted the standard feudal system training mode-one exercise per ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the work and rest schedule set by Hudson, reserve soldiers work eight days out of ten, rest one day, and practice one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, the practice day is also a meat day, and meat can only be eaten on this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the better the performance in training, the more meat you can eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You need to roll up at work, so naturally you should roll up during training. Except during the break, everyone was not allowed to roll, and they rolled wherever they could.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the results of the training make Master Hudson happy, it would be a trivial matter to slaughter one or two more sheep for everyone to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number of livestock in the territory is still small compared to the population, Master Hudson is willing to spend money to buy them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to food standards, who dares to compare with the mountains for hundreds of miles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conscience of the lord is not only reflected in the quality of bread, but also in the meat rationing, the mountain collar is also the only standardized one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other territories, if the serfs want to eat meat, it all depends on the mood of the nobles. Even if the prey is occasionally hunted, the nobles must nod to eat it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standard quantitative supply is also accompanied by serious polarization. The minimum meat supply in the territory is still at 0.5 pounds per month, but the highest standard has climbed to 10 pounds per month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A disparity of 20 times, the former is still happy for a bowl of broth, and the latter has realized the freedom to eat meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no good way to deal with this kind of polarization. The lord made the rules, and if he chose the involutional development model, this scene was bound to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, human nature is \"easy to go from thrift to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they are used to living a hard life. Although the mountain leaders have a lot of work, they can fill their stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Well-behaved role models, even meat-free. Numerous real-life cases continue to stimulate everyone's nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, Hudson is very suspicious, and the serfs will defect on a large scale. In the era of great land reclamation, there was never a shortage of escaped slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, the orders for weapons have suddenly increased in recent days. Many customers are unfamiliar faces, and their accents are not even locals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was not going to take these orders from unknown sources, but because the amount of each order was not large, and they paid generously and were willing to pay in advance, so I still took it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But gradually I discovered that something was wrong. In less than five days, the total sales of weapon orders totaled more than 30,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many orders are crowded together, it is definitely not simple behind this. Perhaps the outside world has changed, and the news has not yet been transmitted. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the analysis of the middle-aged man in charge, Hudson nodded slightly. It's not easy. After more than half a year of starting a business, I finally have talents who can use their brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was placed on the previous confidant, it is estimated that he is coming over to ask for credit with an excited face at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to accurately add up the order amounts without major mistakes is the result of 12 points of hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the fact that there are too many orders, it is a pity that there may be changes outside, which is beyond the scope of people's brain capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, Nick. The business will continue as usual, but we will increase the price by 20% for unfamiliar customers, as our risk tolerance fee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify Tom and let him arrange for someone to report the news to the nobles who have made friends with us. By the way, I also sent someone to inquire about what happened outside. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Nick in front of him performed well, he was a newcomer after all. Regarding his past, Hudson only heard a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the lack of talent in the mountainous territory, and the heavy administrative burden that made him physically and mentally exhausted, Hudson would not have used this kind of person of unknown origin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, the so-called \"do not use the suspect, but do not suspect the employing\" is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of \"suspect not using it\" is that no one is available. It is impossible for anyone to let their subordinates be filled with 100% trusted talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Employers are not suspicious\", then wait for an untimely death and grass on the grave!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't know anything, just met a few times, and you want someone to work for you, that's too simple a talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this kind of talent who can change their minds, they are the most thoughtful. The smarter people are, the more they know how to weigh the pros and cons. It is simply as difficult as heaven to gain the loyalty of these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without experiencing the test of wind and rain, no one can determine the degree of loyalty. In many cases, even the parties themselves do not know whether they can be 100% loyal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the source is, the prerequisite for betrayal is: enough chips. The best way to get along is not to give the other party this opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, now, Hudson will reuse several talents recruited, but all of them must be used with caution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Help with government affairs, participate in the formulation of the rules of the territory, and analyze some situational issues, all of which can be arranged. If you want to participate in the final decision-making, then go to sleep!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, sir.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nick responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to communicate with smart people. Knowing that Hudson does not want to delve into this issue, it is enough to stop immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one point, Hudson had the idea of ​​focusing on training, but he was overwhelmed by reason. There is no way, who made him read too many history books?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early days of entrepreneurship, recruiting talents is not qualified to require loyalty from the other party. Only when it has developed to a certain level and can provide the other party with what it wants in exchange, can it be qualified to ask for loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Equivalent exchange\" is implanted in the bone marrow of every noble child in the continent of Aslante. In the world of nobles, there has never been love and hate for no reason, there is only exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Acquiesced to the order, and Hudson didn't know whether he chose right or wrong. The only thing that is certain is that if you don't do this business, others will do the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the other party is willing to break up the order, no one will take the order. Even if it is discovered by someone with a heart, there is a high probability that they will turn a blind eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I have been suppressed for too long, and there are too many people who want to change the world. Including the collateral members of some big forces, they also want to change the existing profit distribution model.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, these guys have some bottom line, know what sells and what doesn't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inferior weapons are consumables. No matter who they are in, they will be scrapped after a few battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hazards are relatively controllable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
