The main reason was that the orcs were ready to make a move and Hudson couldn't get away.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Everyone knew it was just an excuse, but no one broke it. The defense of the Near East could not be without a leader. Once Hudson led his troops south, he would have to step down as the commander-in-chief of the front.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Compared with the position of commander on the front line, helping the Kingdom of Hessen to suppress the rebellion this time is really too low-class.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The most core issue is still: military power!\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     As the supreme commander on the Near East front, Hudson commanded the kingdom's most elite border troops and the private armies of the nobles in the seven provinces of the Near East. During wartime, he was also able to control the private armies of the nobles in the twelve provinces in the northern border.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In the Near East, the power was unimaginable. The fact that Hudson had to be invited to every important meeting of the kingdom was enough to illustrate the problem.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In comparison, the expeditionary force to the Kingdom of Hesse was of a much lower standard. Not only was the total force limited to 80,000, but the three standing armies sent were also second-line legions.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In non-wartime, this second-line army is usually not fully staffed, usually ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 people. The number of troops depends entirely on which army corps are drawn.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The rest were all private armies of the nobles. Although their combat effectiveness had been greatly improved after so many years of training, they were still not as good as the regular army.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Of course, the military instructors sent to the Kingdom of Hesse all believed that the combat effectiveness of the private army of the kingdom's nobles could catch up with the level of the regular army of the Kingdom of Hesse.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     There is no doubt that this evaluation is biased. Although they are all private armies of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom, the difference in combat effectiveness among them is greater than the difference between humans and dogs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If it were Hudson's own private army, this evaluation would definitely be a bit conservative. The three elite legions in the territory are also top-notch in the kingdom's standing army.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     As for the combat effectiveness of the private army of any small noble, it depends on the military quality of the noble lord.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Although everyone has been training frantically in recent years, there is still a gap between people.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Some people are able to train serfs into elite soldiers; while others, after training, the serfs remain serfs.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Perhaps they were stronger than ordinary serfs, but their overall level was just that, and they had never reached the threshold of elite troops.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     However, no matter how weak they are, they have received military training after all, and their combat effectiveness is much stronger than that of the rebels who have just taken up arms.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     If the training of the Hessian standing army was a little worse, and there were more nobles who lived a life of idleness, perhaps both sides would be on the same level.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     The more he understood, the more he despised the Kingdom of Hessen. Such a rich family fortune wasted.

The three countries that were once considered as the three great powers, after digging into the inside story, were all just superficial.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Just because Hudson disdains the position of commander-in-chief of the Southern Expedition Army doesn't mean that others don't either.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     All major factions in the court were eyeing the situation covetously, and the local noble lords were also ready to make a move.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     These have little to do with Hudson. Now he is just a spectator.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Politics requires balance. He already controls half of the kingdom's military power.
