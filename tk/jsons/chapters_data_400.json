Do you want to stop it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Antonio asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The work efficiency of orc slaves is definitely not as good as that of serfs. It is also a trouble to manage, otherwise it would have been popularized long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No need! It's too deliberate to block them on such a trivial matter, and the influence of spreading it is not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, they notified us when the Korubians left a few days ago. Although the final harvest is very average, we have to respond to people's gestures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all orc slaves anyway, and Earl Hudson would not feel bad if some died, so he arranged them in the most dangerous place. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an overt conspiracy, even if Hudson knew that he was wearing shoes, he couldn't say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slaves have no human rights, and orc slaves have even less human rights. It is only natural to arrange dirty work for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the original construction technology, some projects in dangerous areas are destined to be filled with life. It is better to fill it with the life of a beast than to fill it with the life of a human.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, I heard that Earl Hudson will be the honorary headmaster of the Arcane Academy under construction in the kingdom. Do you think this will affect us?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo asked worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just from the importance of all parties, it can be judged that the Arcane Academy under construction is not easy. Referring to the magic academy in the capital, Kayo knew that this thing would definitely affect the future political structure of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competitor is not only the founder of the Arcane Academy, but also the honorary principal, but they just installed an ordinary teacher in it. The influence of the two parties on the academy is obviously not at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the Arcane Academy has just been born, and it is the time when credibility is needed, and no one will make trouble at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's character is still guaranteed. In all the time we've had with him, have you ever seen him play tricks?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the current Arcane Academy is not in his turn to make decisions. From the establishment of the college to the present, Hudson has done nothing except to hang a name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't want to do it, but that those old guys hold the Arcane Academy too tightly. Even if Hudson, the honorary principal, doesn't have much say in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's just watch, Hudson will definitely reach out to the Arcane Academy after those old guys are killed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to what Governor Pierce said, Viscount Cayo was very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson's character is good?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back at his memory, he really didn't find any black spots. At least from the standpoint of the nobles of the human race, what Hudson has done is commendable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially on the battlefield of the orcs, they obviously had the opportunity to attack them, but in the end, not only did they not make trouble, but they helped them at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened under the watchful eyes of the public cannot be blamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that at the post-war noble meeting, the proposal on the Koslow family's entry into the circle of great nobles was directly passed by unanimous votes, including the Dalton family who bravely voted for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this guy with good character, he made him miserable! Thinking of my previous sad experience, it was all tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these things cannot be said to people yet. It is not clear how much impact it will have on Hudson's reputation, anyway, Viscount Cayo himself will definitely die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Louis Vuitton III doesn't care about oil and salt. No matter what we say, he doesn't care.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Krasner said with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally this was a trouble for the military, but the shrewd Marquis Lelian took the opportunity to blame it on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The reason is very simple: these reckless people are only suitable for fighting and killing, and the negotiations should be left to professionals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to this kind of talk, even if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to shirk, there is no way to speak up, so it can only accept this trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perseverance, Louis Vuitton III is more difficult than they expected. Not only did coercion and lure not work, the officials sent out to negotiate were actually depressed by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is a prisoner, the king is still full of style. Coordination is impossible, now Louis Vuitton III only do one thing - eat, drink and have fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the palace is the Hessian army, and inside the palace is still the territory of Louis Vuitton III. The treatment that the king deserves is not at all deducted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't want to engage in petty tricks, but there are too many people staring at them. Everyone is smart, if Louis Vuitton III doesn't cooperate, it's just a little more trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If drastic measures are used, something unexpected happens to Louis Vuitton III, and the charges of regicide will fall on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of selective issue, not to mention the pressure of international public opinion, even their own king can't help but kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the Louis Vuitton **** that if he cooperates, he will be the fief earl of the kingdom. If he behaves well, I can give him a rich county as a fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he continues to resist stubbornly, let him take his family out into exile and live a life of being dependent on others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't persuade them, then mobilize the members of the Korubia royal family to persuade them. His queen, prince, and princess were all sent over to let them go to work together! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This action against the Counties of Colombia has gone beyond the mark. If the aftermath is not dealt with properly, the international reputation of the Kingdom of Hesse will be negative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is never easy to annex a country legally. Especially for a country like the Counties of Colombia, which has not fought a single battle, there are many hidden dangers in its future rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't swallow it raw, you can only increase the technical content. For example: the merger of the two countries proposed by Louis Vuitton III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a precedent for this kind of thing in the continent of Aslante. At present, several powerful countries on the mainland were formerly formed by a group of noble lords after the collapse of the empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many great nobles with ancient inheritance, most of their ancestors have given birth to kings. Even if it has been independent for a short time, it has had a glorious history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, don't be angry. Louis Vuitton III really wanted to commit suicide, he was already dead. No matter how fast we act, we can't stop a person from committing suicide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current performance is nothing more than a bargain, wanting to fight for better treatment. We wanted a decent ending, so why didn't he?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the real trouble for us to annex the Counties of Korubia is the scattered noble lords. If these people are not removed, the kingdom's local rule will never be peaceful! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Milton said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just a loud clamor, but when it came time to deal with it, the situation changed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the nobles is sacred and inviolable. Without a suitable reason, even the king has no right to deprive them of their titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal rhythm of seizing titles, the king or governments at all levels have caught the major criminal evidence of the parties and submitted it to the noble council for confirmation before they can officially deprive them of titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of game rule obviously does not apply to the Counties of Colombia. If you want to deprive one or two nobles of their titles, maybe you can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is no wonder that the local nobles can agree to the collective seizure of titles! I'm afraid that if the knives are put on the necks of the councilors, it is impossible for the local aristocratic council to pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the non-war period, Alexander V did not dare to order the execution of nobles, even nobles from other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's even worse to keep these people. The Kingdom of Hesse took great risks to take military action in order to eat meat in the past, not a nominal ruling power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of domestic interest groups are all sharpening their knives and waiting to share the cake. If you suddenly say that the cake is gone, you can't explain it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think should be done?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V asked pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, to deal with diehards who cannot be attacked on the surface, they can only take extraordinary measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in this kind of thing, it is usually the people below who play their subjective initiative, and whether they succeed or fail, they must have nothing to do with the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the July Society has been entrenched in the Counties of Korubia for a long time and is plotting to launch a rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We used to help suppress the rebellion, but the nobles of Korubia didn't appreciate it. If the master does not agree, it is not good for us to forcefully enter their territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the matter is leaked, I am afraid that July will take the risk and launch a rebellion in advance to attack the king of the Counties of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the overall situation, please order the troops that entered the Counties of Colombia to gather in the capital to protect the safety of Louis Vuitton III. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Nicholas suggested with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this kind of thing, the military must stand up and take responsibility, and it cannot be related to the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the Marquis of Lelian figure it out! Everything is based on maintaining the long-term stability of Korubia.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Alexander V directly settled the matter. If you want long-term peace and stability in Korubia, you must first cleanse the unstable factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the July Society suffered a lot. Even though people were still active in the northern part of the Alpha Kingdom, a scapegoat fell from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And it's not enough if you don't memorize it, there will be countless evidence and black materials pointing to them, proving that they did all the bad things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, for the July Club, which is thousands of miles away, it is completely a matter of having too many lice and not itching, and taking the blame can only be regarded as a daily operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, they have resisted countless crimes, and this time is nothing more than adding another one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for cult organizations, no one is clean. Especially the cult organization that has made a name for itself, they are all scapegoats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holy Mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ruthenians have rejected our goodwill, they are only willing to lend a road, and they are not willing to declare war on the dwarf kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Sauron reported with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought it was a surefire thing, but I didn't expect to be rejected by others in the end. You must know that in order to win over the Kingdom of Ruthenia, they also paid a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Holy See was able to pull down and form an alliance with a declining kingdom, but it was still rejected, it is simply...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, Bishop Sauron was ashamed by this incident, and now he is very angry, wishing to send troops to send the Ruthenian king to the barbecue immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Expanding the living space of the human race is everyone's responsibility and obligation. How could the Ruthenians refuse it just by saying no!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to warn the Ruthenian king, telling him: colluding with other races will not end well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other plans remain unchanged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse, find an opportunity to plan several conflicts between the Dwarf Kingdom and the Ruthenian Kingdom. The bigger the matter, the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dark son planted in Ruthenia, this time should also be activated. Release the news: Some high-level people in the Kingdom of Ruthenia have colluded with the dwarves and betrayed the interests of our human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, similar things have happened more than once. His rich experience in political struggles allowed him to skillfully make decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Canglan City, after a simple renovation and renovation, the second arcane academy in mainland China with the mission of \"pursuing the truth\" has begun to enroll students.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The campus is contributed by the Liufeng family. It was originally their residence in the royal capital, but the persevering family has declined, and it is too eye-catching to continue to hold such a mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to normal circumstances, they are usually sold to emerging nobles. However, Duke Liufeng is not a simple person. Although he is a rookie in war, he still has political skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Overcome all opinions and blocked the proposal of family members to sell for cash. After mobilizing family connections, after a lot of hard work, I finally got the opportunity to donate to the Arcane Academy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is a very good investment. The Arcane Academy jointly established by all the powerful forces in the kingdom was destined to be extraordinary from its birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Living every day in the house donated by the Liufeng family, if the academy doesn't take care of them, it will be hard to justify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the declining Liufeng family, the favor invested can save their lives at critical moments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the public preparations to the completion of the college to recruit students, it took less than two months, and it was a proper alpha speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Attended the inauguration ceremony of the academy in person, Caesar IV felt very complicated. I thought I could be the protagonist, but there are too many elders present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disregarding distant uncles for the time being, but uncles, uncles, great-grandfathers, great-grandfathers... a bunch of old royal family antiques have appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The representatives sent by other great nobles in the Kingdom are also a group of old guys over a hundred years old. These guys all have common characteristics, not only powerful, but also surprisingly senior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of old guys over a hundred years old were busy reminiscing about the old days, and directly left the king Caesar IV aside, making him a king who had no reputation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this little depression is nothing. In the extraordinary world, the number of old and undead also means a deep foundation. In an era when the average life expectancy is thirty or forty, no one is weak if they can live to be more than one hundred years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Arcane Academy, but it is actually a display of strength to the outside world. Tell the outside world that the Alpha Kingdom is not in decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the foundation stone laying ceremony went smoothly. This is not the style of the Holy See!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the Frankish Kingdom's Arcane Academy opened, it was attacked many times. If the Franks hadn't suppressed it fast enough, the undead disaster would have almost erupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is claimed to be the work of a cult, but whoever is sitting here does not know that it is the work of the Holy See!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was so violent against the Frankish Kingdom, but it suddenly became milder when it came to the Alpha Kingdom, which is obviously unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps it was the failure last time that the Holy See learned a lesson and gave up this meaningless assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we still need to strengthen our vigilance. There are a bunch of lunatics in the Holy See, but they can do anything! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All unreasonable behaviors can become understandable when they have something to do with a lunatic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the quietness of the Holy See may have something to do with their next actions. There are indications that the Holy See is planning a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who the specific target is is yet to be determined. However, several major armies of the Holy See have entered the stage of preparations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Holy See, but the Kingdom of Dante in the middle, the Kingdom of the South Coast, the Kingdom of Frankish in the south, and the Kingdom of Iberia are all about to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hundred years have passed since the last continental war ended. According to past practice, the next continental war is just around the corner! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said anxiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In fact, the previous counterattack against the orcs has already revealed the true thoughts of several top forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of peace, countries have accumulated countless contradictions, and now it is time to vent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they didn't have a plan, they wouldn't have put in so much effort to help us defeat the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My father predicted before his death that a new round of continental war would break out within ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with a hundred years ago, the overall strength of our human race has increased by at least 30%, while the strength of foreign races has not increased but decreased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the decline of the orc empire, the advantage of the alien alliance over our human race has been minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous continental wars, the overall strength of the human race was obviously at a disadvantage, with more wins and fewer losses. Now that the strength of the two sides tends to be balanced, our chances of winning are even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race wins again in the new round of continental war, it can almost directly announce the end of the era of alien races. From now on, the continent of Aslante will be completely dominated by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are three main waves of alien races in the northern continent, orcs, elves, and ancient survivors. After the best war orc empire was crippled, the threat of the remaining two has actually dropped significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many races of the ancient survivors. Although the combat power is strong, they all fight on their own, and they can't make a difference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the elves is certainly strong, but it is a pity that their martial spirit was lost countless years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously unreliable to expect those guys who are addicted to art to come out to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the northern countries do not take the initiative to invade the elf kingdom, even if the continental war breaks out, they may not be able to make up their minds to fight us desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based solely on the war against foreign races, we are actually not in much danger in this continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that the foreign race will be disabled. Some people can't control their ambitions and want to continue to expand! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous continental wars, the main reason why the human race was able to win was the disunity of the alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two most powerful races among alien races, orcs and elves, are completely different extremes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The warlike orcs have always been the vanguards in launching continental wars. However, the biggest disadvantage of being the first to participate in the battle is that the strength is consumed too quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which stood in front of them, was also full of resilience. No matter how bravely and fearlessly they waged war, they were still held back by this nail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves, who are the champions of paddling, are another extreme. It's like being forcibly dragged onto the battlefield, most of the time it's a symbolic dispatch of troops to fight a few battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you lose a few thousand clansmen, you will feel pain immediately, and you simply don't have the courage to attack at all costs. The greatest significance of the participation of the elves in the war is to hold back a large number of troops of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien races in the northern continent are all scammers, and the alien races in other parts of the mainland can only be tragic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strongest can't be counted on, and the weaker races have met the strongest forces of the human race. It is considered powerful to keep the ancestral foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is a limit to everything. After defeats again and again, the overall strength of these races is also constantly declining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, if they continue to fail, even if they are not exterminated, they will be eliminated from the stage of the continental hegemony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the alien threat is gone, it will be time for the human race to fight among themselves. The final development of the situation, no one can tell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no need to worry too much. The strength of the foreign race is not weak, especially at this critical moment of life and death, it can burst out its potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the continental war breaks out, it will definitely not end in a short time. Perhaps when the war is over, we will also recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the ups and downs, in the future game, the Kingdom may not be at a disadvantage! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister of Newfoundland comforted me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ease on his lips and the worry on his brow still revealed his inner uneasiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no orc empire, it doesn't mean that the Alpha Kingdom can stay out of the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the Civil War of the Warhammer Kingdom, the strength of the Principality of Moxi was greatly reduced, and no one in the Northern Continent could stop the elves except the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the competition for the living space of the races, no one can guarantee that the elves will still paddle in the next continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the elves put in a little effort, those small countries will not be able to hold back, and the Alpha Kingdom will still be dragged into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the ancient survivors from the Ice and Snow World will come out to join in the fun, and the Alpha Kingdom will still be responsible for cleaning up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation were a little worse, the orcs who were huddled in a corner might also come out of the mountains and compete with the seven grassland kingdoms for the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Conduct our speculations and inform the great nobles everywhere so that they can prepare for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's standing army must restore its strength as soon as possible. Especially the Warcraft Legion, more attention should be paid to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Academy of Magic and the Academy of Arcane Arts, I would like to trouble the Prime Minister to go over there and ask them to increase the number of enrollments and focus on cultivating the combat effectiveness of the students.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the talent is good, it may come in handy ten years later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cultivation of magicians, arcanists, wizards, alchemists... These professional talents not only require high talents, but also take a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the many restrictions that knights have become the mainstream of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the son of a great nobleman is talented, it is not a strange thing to become a great knight before the age of twenty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But twenty-year-old great magicians are rare in the entire continent. Even if you have excellent talent and abundant resources, it still depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rare occupations such as Arcanist and Wizard, let alone. There are very few people who practice, and the probability of encountering a genius is even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Arcane Academy opened, under the influence of inherent concepts, noble children still prefer to become magicians and knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson is already busy arranging the autumn harvest. Compared with previous years, the biggest difference this autumn is that there is no need to buy food from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slaves were sent to the construction site, and there was no need for Hudson to continue exporting food. Tens of thousands of mouths were lost at once, and the food in the mountain territory became self-sufficient for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For territorial officials who have been plagued by fiscal deficits for a long time, this is the best medicine to heal their inner wounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cost of purchasing food was saved, and the expenditure of purchasing salt was also greatly reduced. The dying steel industry resumed production, and the fiscal deficit of the territory was quickly wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the estimate of the Ministry of Finance, the fiscal deficit of the territory this year is expected to be controlled within 50,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the shortfall of hundreds of thousands of gold coins in previous years, this is undoubtedly a huge improvement. As long as the stable development continues, there is hope to achieve a balance of payments next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balance of income and expenditure is an important sign of the maturity of a territory, and it means that it has truly gained a firm foothold after passing this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the rough yellow paper in his hand, Hudson very much doubted whether it could be used for writing. However, as the first paper produced without sheepskin, it is understandable that it has some shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the following people continue to try to improve the process, and strive to produce qualified paper in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane, you should go grab this job. Tell the people below not to be afraid of failure, but to be brave enough to try. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the specific papermaking process, and only rely on my smattering of memory, the development of the papermaking industry in the mountainous area is not smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the initial expectations, Hudson's expectations in his heart dropped again and again. When he was ready to fight the protracted war, the first piece of paper was finally born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the quality is good or bad, we have achieved a breakthrough from zero to one, and from one to one hundred in the later stage, we only need to continue to pile resources into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a feudal lord, raw materials and labor do not cost money, and the cost that Hudson needs to pay is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Lord Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kane readily agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the paper hadn't been made, he would have wondered if it was the lord's whimsy, but the first piece of paper had already been born, and the difficulty had already dropped by several grades in the later stage, only to improve the craftsmanship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, the awe of Hudson couldn't help but deepened again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the training of the first batch of fishermen has ended, and they are now engaged in fishing, and the results are even better than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fishery resources in this sea area are really rich. You can gain something by logging off the net almost at will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The average daily fish production is 38,000 pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second batch of fishermen also participated in the training. Once the training is completed, the daily fish output of the territory will exceed 100,000 pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the taste of these sea fish is very average, and they are not popular in the market. Unless there is a catastrophe, they will not be sold at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob said with mixed joy and sorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small market determines the limited sales of fish products. A large amount of fresh fish cannot be sold, so it can only be processed into dried fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the market for dried fish is even smaller, and the aristocratic lords with purchasing power simply don't like this stuff, and the pitifully small number of free citizens are the buyers of dried fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family failed to start this business, and encountered the same problem when they arrived in the mountainous area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you can't sell it, you can eat it yourself. The order will be passed down, and on the basis of the rations of the people, three pounds of dried fish will be added every month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Store the remaining dried fish first! As long as it is well marinated, it won't go bad for a while, and maybe it will come in handy in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long wanted to increase the meat supply of the citizens, but due to the low production of pork, beef and mutton, after prioritizing the needs of artisans, ordinary citizens could only get a one-pound quota per month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that there is fish supplementation, Hudson has also become generous. As for the taste, in the era when being able to fill one's stomach is happiness, there is no need to think so much for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson has also worked hard for the nutrition of the citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the supply of meat, the supply of vegetables is also specified. Many wild vegetables that taste good are widely planted in mountainous areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vegetable oil originally intended to produce soap ended up in everyone's stomachs. Now ordinary citizens can get a half-pound vegetable oil quota every month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is another practical factor behind this-soap is unsalable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's the wizarding world after all, and there are better alternatives to soap. The nobles thought it was for the untouchables, and directly labeled the soap as a low-end product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of face, the little nobles are also embarrassed to buy. Soap, which was a little hot just now, has become a product of the poor before it can be popularized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Constrained by the original traditional production process and the high price of raw materials, the production cost of soap remains high. If the price is reduced and the volume is reduced, it will be a blood loss, so we have to choose to stop production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The product was not produced, and Hudson did not let go of the planting of oil crops. The squeezed oil naturally entered the stomachs of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the improvement in nutrition supply, the long-term land reclamation work would have worn out people, and it simply couldn't last until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in addition to these regular rations, there will be opportunities to improve food during special festivals and major events.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to many territories in the Aslante continent, the living standards of the people in the mountainous territories are definitely at the top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest beneficiary is still the younger generation. Obtained a quota of oil and meat equivalent to that of an adult, without heavy physical labor, and his physical fitness has improved significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct manifestation is: the proportion of people suitable for joining the army is constantly rising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the youngsters who have the talent for cultivation and have been selected into the territorial reserves since they were young, and trained individually, that's not to mention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivation resources may not be guaranteed, but there is absolutely no shortage of meat supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, adding three pounds of dried fish at one time, will it be too much?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to increase the supply of dried fish by one pound first, and the rest will be distributed in the form of rewards according to the specific performance of the leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or when organizing collective labor, directly add it to the food standard in order to better mobilize everyone's enthusiasm for labor. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob said in pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stimulate productivity, although household contracting is not implemented, in specific agricultural production, tasks are still divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, the tasks were assigned with Baojia as the unit, and then gradually implemented to the family. There is a clear division of who is in charge of which field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the autumn harvest season, those with high output will receive material rewards, which can be meat products and oil, clothes and shoes, or daily necessities; those with low output can only get the basic material quota.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the living standards of ordinary people in the mountainous areas have gradually become divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life of the down-to-earth citizens is getting better and better; for those who steal, **** and play tricks, life is still so hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this can be regarded as an alternative distribution of production to households within the scope of the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the serf system and land property rights, Lord Hudson dare not touch it now. If these core issues are not involved, it is just the optimization of the management system, not the reform of the social system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The optimization of the management system, even if it is exposed, is nothing more than everyone learning together. If changes are made to the social system, it will stab a hornet's nest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the political fallout is far more serious than that. There are not many crimes that can cause a nobleman to be deprived of a title, but this is one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, let's do as you say! The Ministry of Government Affairs has formulated a specific standard and made it clear in the reward and punishment mechanism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The focus of the next step is to divert the citizens. Judging from the current situation, the food production capacity of the territory can already be self-sufficient, and the follow-up land reclamation efforts can be slightly slowed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next year's land reclamation goal, let's cut it by one-fifth! The vacated labor force is invested in other fields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Residents who are over 30 years old do not need to change their occupations. But the career arrangement of the younger generation must be carried out according to the actual needs of the territory, and not all of them can be sent to farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs must start work in this area early. We can't wait until the territory has excess food production capacity before considering this issue. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is relative, along with food self-sufficiency. The strategic planning of the mountain territory must also be adjusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land reclamation work still needs to continue, but the investment must be reduced. After all, other industries must also develop, and we cannot focus all our attention on farming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although more food is better, it also has a limit. In the absence of a market, blindly increasing grain production capacity will only drive down the price of grain to the point where cabbage can't even be sold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, it is still a population problem. If there are millions of people in the mountain territory, then all this will not be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there are only more than 300,000 people in the mountainous territory. Even if Hudson has introduced many policies to stimulate fertility, it still cannot quench the near thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, if we only reduce the wasteland reclamation goal by one-fifth, I am afraid that our food production capacity will soon be severely oversupplied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, starting next year we will have a food surplus. And the amount of this balance will be very considerable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to stop the land reclamation work first to reduce the burden on the territory. We have worked so hard for so many years, so we just took this opportunity to take a rest. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the Ministry of Government Affairs is not going to continue to open up wasteland. People's consumption of food is completely different during working hours and resting hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once land reclamation stops, the ration consumption of the citizens can be reduced by at least one-third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This part of the grain alone is enough to feed more than one hundred thousand people for a year. Coupled with the continuous increase in the grain output of the newly opened land, the final balance will only be more, so it is not surprising that the Ministry of Government Affairs stopped the land reclamation work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter, just build more granaries if there is excess production capacity. Once people are idle, they are prone to problems. The intensity of land reclamation can be reduced, but it must be gradually reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow-up, you can gradually reduce everyone's labor level and increase the rest time of the leaders, but you can't just relax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are not enough job placements, then organize people for military training. The world is not peaceful, and it is only a matter of time before a war breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from next year, the reserve training that was originally stopped will resume again. Except for special positions, all young people of the right age in the territory must participate in military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, I lowered the selection threshold for the youth camp. As long as the cultivation qualifications are adequate and the parents have no criminal records, I will recruit people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Set up a separate women's camp to select talented girls for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will personally be responsible for these two training camps, and the Ministry of Government Affairs will do the logistics work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, the food production capacity will be almost digested. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Looking at the tumbling wheat waves, Hudson, who was holding his son, couldn't help showing a happy smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this bumper harvest, the newly migrated serfs should feel at ease. For the people at the bottom, there is nothing more reassuring than a bumper harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grain output will not lie. After several years of hard work, the grain yield per mu of the territory has further increased, and the average yield per mu has exceeded 220 pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the effect of fertilizer, or the effect of selective breeding, or maybe both, Hudson is not sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is just a small problem, regardless of the specific reason, anyway, both hands must be grasped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seeds should be of the highest quality, the marsh brand chemical fertilizers should continue to be used, and the farm composting technology should not be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the yield per mu is also due to the low yield per mu of the newly developed mountainous areas, which hindered it. In the most fertile swamp farmland, the yield per mu even approached three hundred pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this data is only in the hands of the high-level people in the territory. Ordinary people only know that the mountainous areas have had a bumper harvest, but they really don't have a clear idea of ​​the extent of the bumper harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a spy spread the news, everyone would only think that this was a case of a local harvest. Similar things have not happened before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In a battlefield where two armies are fighting brutally, it will be easier to get a bumper harvest in the coming year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: when there is heavy snow in winter, the grain output in the coming year will be higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone hasn't done in-depth research, lacks knowledge in related fields, and more often attributes this extraordinary thing to God's blessing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson already has a lot of sacred aura, and he doesn't mind adding another one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"Blessed by the Gods\" doesn't need him to promote it, there are a bunch of tap fans to put it on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the status is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When such a thing happened during the period of the minor aristocrats, it was a matter of life and death, and a little carelessness would result in death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, at best, it will cause people who are interested in secretly peeping. You won't send people over to **** it just because of a rumor that's not sure whether it's true or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no shortage of food in the southeast province. The Dalton family may have turned against the Koslow family for other reasons, but it is absolutely impossible to start a noble war just to increase the grain yield by tens of catties per mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Blood Moon defense line that is currently being built, everyone has money to contribute money, and some people contribute people. What the Dalton family contributes is food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the power of one family to supply hundreds of thousands of laborers with daily food and drink, the fact that the Dalton family is still able to sell food to the outside world is enough to explain the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the publicly available data, the Dalton family controls more than 30,000 square kilometers of land, with a population of over one million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the actual data is doubled, it is not surprising. Hudson has not forgotten that the Dalton family still has islands overseas, and these sites are not under the jurisdiction of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a strong family background, it is naturally not a big problem to supply hundreds of thousands of workers with rations. It is nothing more than taking the food that originally supported northern Xinjiang and using it to build a defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the burden of supplying supplies to northern Xinjiang, the overall burden on the nobles in the southeastern provinces has been greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the sharp drop in food prices and the lack of enough buyers in the market, there wouldn't be so many minor nobles in financial crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you delve deeper, you can also have a relationship with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the military grain consumption in the northern border, the grain production capacity in the southeastern province is seriously overcapacitated. However, the mountainous region, which has always been the largest grain buyer in the southeastern province, suddenly stopped purchasing grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The double crises collided together, directly triggering the collapse of food prices. Don't say that it is compared with the war period, even before the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, Hudson is also to blame. Looking at it from another perspective, the land reclamation plan in the mountainous territory is purely an increase in food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of a slight decline in the overall population of the southeastern province, the continuous increase in food production capacity is undoubtedly the culprit of the crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know what you know, but Master Hudson didn't mean to worry about everyone. If it is unsalable, it will be unsalable, anyway, he has no food to sell now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current retail price of rye on the market is 2.5 copper coins per pound, which is 0.5 copper coins lower than the normal price before the war broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For food, such a price drop is already tragic. But this doesn't make any sense, only one-sixth of the price drop is far from being able to buy the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, with Hudson's personality, he is not allowed to do things like taking advantage of the fire. Even if you are purchasing grain reserves, you can only follow the market price, and you can't do things that deliberately lower the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then simply wait and discuss this issue when the warehouses of the nobles are full, it is often easier to achieve the goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reserve grain, reserve grain, and most importantly—reserve!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one stipulates that grain reserves must be piled up in their own warehouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If conditions permit, it is also a good choice to temporarily put it in the neighbor's warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core factor is caused by the immaturity of the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is excess grain production capacity in a mature commodity market, the downstream industrial chain can also be extended, for example: the development of aquaculture, wine making, food processing...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in these industries, the more they do, the more they lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a self-sufficient economy, everyone can produce these products by themselves. Except for those emerging nobles in the north who need to purchase, there is no market at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these products are transported from the southeastern provinces to northern Xinjiang. Not to mention the long distance, the tolls along the way can make people bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can go by sea, the situation may be better. You can do business in coastal cities, but unfortunately there are only two ports in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One port is on the prairie, which is controlled by the Farland Kingdom among the Seven Kingdoms of the prairie; the other port is in the hands of Duke Hiero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire southeastern province, only the Dalton family can do business, but it is only limited to the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply impossible to go deep into the inland to do business. The two major forces controlling the port are now counting on the monopoly to make huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the king has sent an official document.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom's words interrupted Hudson's family fun. He turned around and handed little Franz to Melissa, then took the official document and read it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's wrong with Hudson, did something happen again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the time the two got acquainted to now, there have not been a few days of peace. It's not fighting, it's preparing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after the war ended, there were a lot of problems, which made everyone feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No big deal!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs plans to station two legions in the southeastern province to prevent the Hessians from invading. This is asking for my opinion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was easy on the lips, but Hudson was not at all calm in his heart. Beware of the Hessians, this kind of excuse to fool children, he does not believe it ten thousand times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if war broke out immediately, if the Kingdom of Hesse wanted to invade the southeastern province, it had to open the road to the Blackstone Mountains first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a natural buffer zone, which is enough to buy time for the kingdom to dispatch troops, and there is no need to put two standing legions in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using this kind of low-end excuse, it is better to say: food prices in the southeastern province are cheap, and placing the standing army here can purchase nearby, which can save military expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you going to refuse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked curiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have heard and seen since I was a child, and I still have political sensitivities. It seems that it is nothing to put two standing corps in the southeastern province, but in fact it is the central government that is reaching out to the local government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easier to invite God than to send God away!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once these two legions are brought in, it will be very difficult to drive them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"They came at the wrong time, if it was half a year ago, I wouldn't mind them coming to muddy the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately not now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a lot of difficulty, we eased the relationship with the Dalton family and established a fragile balance. At this time, a strong dragon inserts, and the balance will definitely be broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family has long regarded the southeastern province as their back garden, and they will definitely not let people extend their tentacles in unless necessary. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earlier, Caesar IV also reminded the nobles in the country to abandon their prejudices and prepare for war wholeheartedly. In just a blink of an eye, the central government wanted to intervene in local affairs again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is not ruled out that this is really for the safety of the southeastern province, but the probability is too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, except for Count Carles and Count Martinez, everyone else has rejected the kingdom's garrison.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero frowned and reported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conscience of heaven and earth, this time the Ministry of Military Affairs wrote this article, sincerely in order to strengthen border defense and reduce military expenditure by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the major grain-producing provinces in the south, the price of grain in the royal capital, which needs to transfer grain from other places, is 70% to 80% higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of troops gathered near the capital is a burden to the kingdom. With limited military expenditures, the Ministry of Military Affairs had to find ways to cut costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the painstaking efforts, it was not understood at all. Except for the provinces of Kovasia and Obera, which were frightened by the Hessians, the other provinces in southern Xinjiang did not buy it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, let them go! They choose the road by themselves, and they have to bear the consequences themselves. In case a future war breaks out, they will cry.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles were worried that he, the king, would use the garrison to intervene in local affairs, but he had really restrained himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large provinces like the Southeast Province, with only two legions stationed, can at most gain some right to speak. How can they be qualified to compete for decision-making power in local affairs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no one will believe this word. After all, his political credibility as a king has not yet been established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the garrison is only a small problem. Since they can choose to refuse, it is naturally due to their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the great nobles in the north, the great nobles in the south are better at hiding their strength. It seems that they have put in all their strength in all previous wars, but no one knows how much they have actually hidden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the Liufeng family for example. Everyone thought that after the entire army was wiped out, the Liufeng family, whose vitality was greatly weakened, would be devastated, but their remaining strength still kept most of their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the political influence was not too bad and we needed to give everyone an explanation, I am afraid that Duke Liufeng would not even give up the position of governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, they have declined and become middle-class nobles, but the overall strength in their hands is still the No. 1 family in Fengyun Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Dalton family is similar. I thought that the Koslow family would challenge them after the war, but nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson's choice of silence is enough to prove the strength of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the military strength of these great nobles in southern Xinjiang is far inferior to the families in northern Xinjiang, but the real gap may not be as great as we imagined. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the nobles of northern Xinjiang are honest, but they have been beaten by orcs all year round, and they can't hide their strength at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the great nobles in the south are different. They have played the role of reinforcements in all previous wars, and the deeper they hide, the better it is for the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based solely on the apparent military strength, the strength of the Dalton family is only one-third of the weakest family among the five noble families in northern Xinjiang, and the Liufeng family is only half of the weakest family among the five major families in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, judging from the performance of the two major families, there is more than just this strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the apparent loss of the army, the organizational system can be restored immediately. Even if the combat power has declined, it is enough to prove that the family is strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the kingdom, the strength of the domestic nobles is undoubtedly a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the king, that may not be the case. No monarch likes to hide his strength from his subordinates, and this kind of concealment often means uncontrollable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Prime Minister, I am not a small-minded person. They have the confidence to stop the invasion of the Kingdom of Hesse, which is also a good thing for the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to mention the matter of the garrison. Next, the kingdom's strategic focus is to recuperate and recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the newly recovered seven provinces of the Northland, which still need time to develop, and there is no requirement, the other provinces must replenish the noble private army within three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for these border provinces, they must be urged to expand their armies and prepare for war. The Ministry of Military Affairs will focus on this aspect of work, and we must make everyone ready for war at any time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Caesar IV, who said he didn't care, was not really so generous. It can be seen from the content of the words that it is completely disgusting people under the banner of \"for your own good\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arms expansion and preparations for war are easy to say, but these preparations require money. Unlike the serf soldiers who served without pay, the official private army of the nobles also needed to be paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how economical you are, you have to be able to support your family. Otherwise, those wandering knights would not have come to seek refuge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the private army system be restored, and the big nobles don't care. Originally, their organizational systems were all complete, and the difference was only in the reduction of combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ones who were really injured were the little nobles below. Theoretically speaking, they should have recovered after two years of recuperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in the past two years, there has been an additional war repayment tax. This tax is not too much to be apportioned to individuals, but the tax is collected in pure cash and cannot be offset in kind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For nobles in areas with convenient transportation and well-developed commerce, there is not much pressure, just take the property and realize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for some aristocratic lords with blocked traffic, remote locations, and lack of means of monetization, this is a big trouble. If the nobles are stuck, the problem will be even more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life is already difficult, so where is the spare energy to expand the army and prepare for war! It's good that Wang Guo didn't mention this issue, but if he reminded him, it would be a heavy burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood Moon County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you sure you read correctly, the monsters in the Blackstone Mountains are gathering?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, cases of monsters attacking construction teams have been on the rise. In order to find out the situation, he had to send experts to go deep into the Blackstone Mountains to check the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a problem with this investigation. According to past experience, the gathering of a large number of monsters often means that a beast tide is about to break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I have witnessed this incident with my own eyes. If my crack beast was not fast enough, I almost couldn't come back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magister Yuli said with lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking among the monsters for a while, and being able to come back intact is definitely the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But whoever is unlucky and is targeted by a high-level monster in the Blackstone Mountains, the fate to meet him is to become poop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How big is the herd?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also three, six, nine grades of animal swarms, and some small animal swarms can be handled by small nobles in the countryside; it is not surprising that large animal swarms destroy counties and provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The largest beast horde in history, even had a record of destroying the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't know! Anyway, I saw hundreds of monsters, and there are monsters gathering here on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of high-level monsters living in the Blackstone Mountains, and ordinary people can't get close to them at all. If you want to know the specific situation, you should ask the Earl of Hudson to check it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magister Yuli suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he wants to throw the blame away, it's just that it's too dangerous to go deep into the Black Rock Mountains now. On the way back, he saw a lot of mercenary groups, which turned into snacks for monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that the magister was in danger in the past. Even the great magister can't guarantee that he can escape unscathed when encountering these high-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the legendary strong man in the sanctuary has to run away when he encounters a herd of beasts. Once surrounded, it is also possible to bury the bones in the green hills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, not one or two masters died in the Black Rock Mountain Range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Knight was able to check in the past, not only because of the powerful fighting power of the dragon, but also because of the fast running of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even high-level monsters rarely catch up with dragons. Being able to catch up does not mean being able to beat them. After all, Warcraft is not omnipotent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gaining an advantage in speed, there will inevitably be certain disadvantages in other aspects, and it is impossible to take up all the talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't bother the two masters with one thing. Magister Yuli has a lot to do with it. It is not appropriate to leak it now. I will trouble you to go to the mountains to lead the way.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said a little tiredly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am really tired. I thought I could take the opportunity of building the blood moon defense line to complete the further integration of the nobles in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan didn't change quickly, and the start of construction from the defense line has not been smooth. First, the kingdom's debt crisis broke out, and then the international situation became tense again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they are far away from the southeastern province, but none of them are related, and all of them require Governor Pierce to pay special attention to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He just rejected the kingdom's garrison, and now there are signs of a beast tide, and he is not given a chance to relax at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had known earlier that there was a wave of beasts waiting here, when the Ministry of Military Affairs proposed to garrison troops, he would not have refused so simply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the situation where the scale of the beast horde is uncertain, it is definitely a great thing to have two more standing legions to fill the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in politics, what is said cannot be undone. He just rejected the kingdom's garrison just now, and he can't change his position immediately and invite him back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, for the safety of millions of people in the southeast province, I'll make a trip!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After pretending to be forceful, Magister Yuli turned around and left the gate. Summoned the split sound beast, went straight to the mountain collar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

However, as the number one kingdom on the mainland, the Frankish Kingdom still needs a face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is to launch a war against a foreign race, it must be \"justified\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No direct answer, just a hint in the eyes, the Marquis Jesús, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who understood, immediately took over the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three days ago, the diplomatic envoy we sent was attacked in the border area. According to the assassin's body left at the scene, it can be determined that it was done by half-orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a note to the half-orc kingdom, asking them to hand over the murderer, but has not received a satisfactory answer so far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the deadline has passed, the kingdom's diplomatic efforts for peace on the continent have all ended in failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we can only take extraordinary measures to let the evil half-orcs know that my Frankish Kingdom cannot be humiliated! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the strange expressions on everyone's face, it can be seen that everyone is not aware of the \"assassination of envoys\", and it was obviously planned temporarily by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to create an excuse for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They don't know, so the orcs are confused. He received the diplomatic note in a daze, and it would be strange if he could hand over the murderer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether the half-orcs are confused or not. Now that the charges have been charged, whether they admit it or not, it will not affect the final result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it is aimed at aliens, an excuse is enough, there is no need to be so serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, after this war is over, the orc kingdom will be wiped off the map, and the dead cannot come out to reverse the case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn half-orcs, dare to attack the Kingdom Mission! Your Majesty, please order troops to severely punish this evil race that provokes the dignity of the Kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the prime minister, Duke Bergson finished speaking, all the ministers responded one after another. In the blink of an eye, the half-orcs have become the most evil race on the continent and must be destroyed physically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we go to war against the half-orc kingdom now, how will the countries on the mainland react?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war broke out, the half-orc kingdom had already been sentenced to death in the eyes of Charles III, and the dead enemies could naturally be ignored. Such arrogance naturally stems from strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After years of persecution and bloodletting, the orc kingdom has been severely weakened. Especially a few days ago, a large-scale locust plague broke out in the half-orc kingdom, and this year's crops were almost wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Races compete for living space, and there is no room for warmth. Killing you while you are sick is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race was able to go from a small marginal race to the peak of the mainland all the way, relying on the ability to seize the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through victories over and over again, the human race has finally created its present glory, but this is still not enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overlord of the mainland is not as good as dominating the mainland after all, and keeping foreigners by his side is always a threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, the hatred between the human race and the alien race has been deeply rooted in the war after war, and there is no possibility of any relaxation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one is trying to fight for peace. Unfortunately, when the last unified empire of the human race collapsed, the alien race formed an alliance and launched a major counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the allies and younger brothers of the human race at that time chose to abandon the covenant and joined the alien alliance, completely burying the last trust between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured! Everything is planned. We have reached an agreement with the Kingdom of Iberia, the Kingdom of Dante, the Holy See, the Kingdom of Hesse... and everyone will launch a war against other races at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the countries in the Northern Continent, the entire human world will be involved in this war, and we already have an absolute advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the elves, the ancient survivors, and the orcs who were seriously injured in the early stages of the war recklessly fought out to coexist with all the tribes, the defeat of the alien alliance would only be a matter of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of hard work, the alien alliance has long been disintegrated by us from within. Until the last moment of life and death, it is impossible for them to put down their suspicions and cooperate sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long ago we were lenient in the war against the orcs, and misled a lot of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimating that there are many races in the alien alliance, I now think that the next continental war will be similar to the past, just to consume the excess population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the early stage of the war is fooled, after the destruction of several foreign races, even if they are aware of the danger, it will be too late to unite for survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's not without risk. Once the continental war breaks out, the orcs who have shrunk back are likely to make a comeback, and the newly established Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland may not be able to keep their foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Warhammer in the civil war is also in a dangerous situation. If it is not careful, it will be destroyed by the ancient survivors and elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, there are only one and a half major powers remaining in the Northern Continent. The Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi alone can at most protect themselves, and it is difficult to stop the three major alien forces!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is more troublesome is that the Alpha Kingdom has not yet realized the threat of aliens, and has devoted a lot of energy to preventing the Hessians from taking advantage of the fire. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Jesús analyzed rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is the weakest in the North Continent, but it happens to meet the strongest alien race. If it weren't for the fact that the elves had no desire to fight, the Northern Continent would have long been dominated by alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After the war breaks out, send someone to remind Caesar IV, but the effect should not be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the orcs invaded, the countries in the North Continent did not fully assist them. Now that the situation is changing, it may be difficult for them to make the decision to send all their troops for reinforcements in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to revenge psychology, there is also a problem of strength. In the previous wars, the Alpha Kingdom was injured, and now it has recovered slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, it is really embarrassing for them to work **** an expedition. Regarding the situation in the Northern Continent, we cannot have too high expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inform the Farland Kingdom that if they can't stop the orcs' advance, they will stick to the port and wait for reinforcements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never mention the Principality of Moxi. Obviously, that half of the powerful country was directly ignored by Charles III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in the orc invasion, the Principality of Moxi performed well, but it was not based on the premise of having allies to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early stage of the war, the performance of the Mosi people was not up to standard. Kong has military strength, but he has not been able to make good use of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the Warhammer Kingdom was at the bottom, highlighting their excellence, the Principality of Moxi might have also become a laughing stock in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no need to worry about the situation in the Northern Continent. No matter how unbearable the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland are, such a large territory can hold back the orcs for a year or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those elves obsessed with art are all indecisive masters. When they make up their minds to attack with all their strength, it may take a year or so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small countries in the Northern Continent can survive for a few months no matter what. Such a long buffer period is enough for the Alpha Kingdom to prepare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hope of a counterattack. With the strength of the Alpha Kingdom, it is still possible to stick to it for a year or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least within three years, these alien races will be dragged in the northern continent, unable to really interfere in the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For such a long time, even if we didn't destroy the orc kingdom, we still maimed them, and the other companies probably did the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the overall situation will be decided, and no matter how hard the alien alliance works, it will be powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the eternal hegemony of the human race, it is totally worthwhile to make the countries of the Northern Continent pay a little bit of sacrifice! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Bergson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One general succeeds and ten thousand bones die\", not to mention the right to rule a continent. Impossible without sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking history as a mirror, the decline of the mainland overlords in the past dynasties was overthrown by the vassal races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they are strong, everyone lowers their eyebrows and pleases them in every possible way. Once a flaw is revealed, they immediately attack in groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race, which has learned from the experience of the predecessors, has formulated a racial strategy to suppress other races from the moment it ascended to the overlord's position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the relationship is good or bad, as long as the strength is strong, it will be suppressed. Such a high-pressure policy made the race lose friends, and it also made the race stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of enemies all over the world, the glory of the human race was forged. It has developed to the present, and there is even hope of unifying the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the general trend is mine, let's go!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This battle must be fast, no need to continue to hide it, let the people below show their real skills, this battle must be fought with the prestige of my Frankish Kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said domineeringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Blackstone Mountains, Master Hudson, who didn't know that the continental war was about to break out, was still staring at the herd of beasts below in the clouds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Beast Tide\", he has heard of this thing countless times, but this is the first wave he has personally experienced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the news, I rushed over to check it out. Apart from worrying about the Blood Moon defense line, there was also curiosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson doesn't want to shoot these monsters. Even if he was engaged in the Warcraft Legion in front of him, he did not enter the Black Rock Mountains to hunt for Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not impossible, the main reason is that these monsters also play the role of \"barrier\". Some guys are here, and the Kingdom of Hesse cannot be easily killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the monsters are killed, only a forest will not be able to stop the Hessian soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if war does not break out, human beings can't help but expand outwards according to their style. Extend the territory to the forest for hundreds of meters today, and enclose another piece tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the land under your feet is suitable for cultivation, this kind of spontaneous expansion is indispensable. The forest barrier of less than 100 kilometers cannot withstand the toss of the nobles on both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe after the monsters in this area are cleared, there will be monsters from other places to replenish, but it will take time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ever-shrinking distance also means that the probability of conflicts is increasing. Especially the contention for the land of no man is the most common fuse in the civil war of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the cub return, Hudson hurriedly asked: \"Bear Stearns, how many high-level monsters are there?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many kinds of beast tides, but the most powerful ones are all commanded by high-level monsters. The more high-level monsters appear in the beast tide, the greater the destructive power they can cause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These high-level monsters are all antiques that have lived for countless years. Their wisdom is no less than that of humans, and their experience is even more abundant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against a group of beasts commanded by high-level monsters is a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not many, there are only three high-level monsters in total, and the rest are ordinary goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, let's get the ugly out of the way first. Ben Xiong will not interfere in the war between humans and monsters, and don't count on me, including spying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have to be careful not to rush to the front line. In case of danger, I am only responsible for carrying you back to a safe area. If it affects the command and operations, I will not be responsible for it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he came up, he dropped the pick. Hudson just wanted to get angry, but then pressed down again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earth Bear is also a monster. Although it is not of the same family as the group of monsters below, it still belongs to the big family of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the war between monsters and humans, and Bear Stearns, who is caught in the middle, can already give him face if he can not help each other. It would be too much to ask people to betray their own race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for low-level monsters without intelligence, other monsters that have signed contracts with humans will not participate in such wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, during the war you are only responsible for protecting my safety, and leave the battle to Maxim.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson waved indifferently and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a bear as a thug, he still has a dragon. What's more, this war is not just his own war, there are allies who can share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing Bear Stearns succeed in paddling, Maxim also said: \"Hudson, I too...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, are you also a monster? Are you not going to want the dignity of the dragon family?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be surprised and exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unified conclusion on the continent of Aslant as to whether a giant dragon is considered a monster. Some people classify them into the big family of Warcraft, and some people list them separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the arrogant dragon never admits that he is a lowly monster. Anyone who dares to say that they are monsters to their face must turn their backs immediately!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course this dragon is not a monster!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, that's not what I want to say. It's okay to fight, but we have to negotiate the cost first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are gold coins of the same size as this dragon, and the three high-level monsters below, I will help you stop them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the saliva flowed out. That greedy expression made Hudson reassure that his mount was indeed a pure-blooded dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the other three dragon knights are not very active. It is estimated that everyone was frightened by the asking price of their own dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim is considered good, subject to the additional clauses in the contract, at least he will not be charged for daily operations, and other dragons are not necessarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"roll!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One word expresses Hudson's mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to ask for gold coins of the same size as himself, Maxim is no longer a lion, but pure robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't have the time to calculate the specific number. Anyway, he couldn't afford it, and it was impossible for him to accept this kind of blackmail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't be angry. The price is negotiable. With the relationship between us, we can let you owe it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, you don't have to pay for this money. After a little operation, someone will pay, how about giving you a hundred gold coins? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim's greedy words made Hudson lose his temper. Reason told him that if he got angry with this idiot, he could only come out at noon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't dream, Maxim, do you think I can be bought with a hundred gold coins?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson wanted to give himself a big mouth. Sure enough, he was so confused that he didn't even know what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop talking nonsense, if you want gold coins, go and capture prisoners for me, I only accept living monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hundred gold coins for a first-order monster, two hundred gold coins for a second-tier monster, five hundred gold coins for a third-tier monster, two thousand gold coins for a fourth-tier monster, four thousand gold coins for a fifth-tier monster, eight thousand gold coins for a sixth-tier monster, thirty thousand gold coins for a seventh-tier monster, eight 100,000 gold coins for Tier 9 Warcraft and 500,000 gold coins for Tier 9 Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of female animals in the breeding period is doubled on the basis of the above. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reward price is definitely not comparable to the market price of Warcraft. But the captured ones are all wild monsters, so it is difficult to train them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a trained Warcraft adds a zero to the above price, everyone will rush to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Warcraft will last forever, and one will last forever.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike wild monsters, even if a contract is signed, the owner will leave once he dies. A trained monster can be a family heirloom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why Warcraft cubs are so popular. Only cubs can be trained, and once a high-level monster becomes an adult, there is no possibility of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many monsters in the hands of the great nobles, but few high-level monsters. The main reason is that these intelligent races are not easy to raise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even cubs raised since childhood are also vengeful. If you dare to feed them ripening potions, there will be backlash in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal rhythm of breeding, the long growth cycle, not to mention the huge cost, the key is to ensure that the power of the family can last for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the monsters are not raised and the family declines first, all the previous investment will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just these things, it's not unbearable. For the nobles, the cost of raising a few more monsters is still affordable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst thing is these magical beasts, which are easy to be raised and discarded during the long growth cycle. There are too many high-level magical beasts that remain at the fifth or sixth level after being raised for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Governor Pierce's flaming lion was originally a high-level monster, but when he reached the fifth level, he became an adult ahead of schedule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I tried my best, but finally stopped at the sixth level, unable to cross the threshold of the seventh level, let alone continue to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spending hundreds of years to cultivate a mid-level monster is undoubtedly a **** business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how high the probability of failure may be, there are also successful cases. These successful cases are the motivation to stimulate everyone to continue investing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hudson is drawing cakes for Maxim, mainly for low-level monsters. For these low-intelligence races, the difficulty of contracting is relatively low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the female animal here, it doesn't matter whether it can be contracted or not. If it is captured and bred with Maxim, it will soon be another litter of cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, what kind of dragon do you think of me. How can I do the work of a slave trader? You have to pay more!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Maxim's words, Hudson almost fell off the dragon's back. We were still talking about principles before, but in the blink of an eye, it became only money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold coins don't have any real meaning to the dragon, and I really don't understand where the dragon's wealth fan attribute comes from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back to the camp, and briefly explained the situation with Governor Pierce, the atmosphere in the room suddenly became heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, are you sure the beast tide is coming towards us?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the beast tide breaks out, the construction progress of the Blood Moon Defense Line will definitely be affected. Even the completed basic projects may be damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the tide of beasts is overcome, it will be a lose-lose situation for the monsters and the nobles of the southeastern provinces, and only the Kingdom of Hesse can benefit from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Judging from the current movement direction of the beast herd, the beast tide is indeed coming towards us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe we built the defense line and stimulated them; or maybe there are too many monsters in the Hessen Mountains, and the resources in the mountains can't support so many monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also possible that a certain mercenary group got into trouble and stimulated the high-level monsters in the mountains, and wanted to take revenge through this method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many possibilities that it doesn't matter right now. The crux of the problem is how we should deal with this beast tide now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The size of the beast herd is indeed not small, but this is Blood Moon County, and there is still a long distance from the mountain territory, so it won't be able to harm him in a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many nobles along the way, after layers of blocking, the beast herd is almost consumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The border between the Southeast Province and the Hessen Mountains is too long, and the herd can choose a breakthrough location at will, so it is difficult to stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are high-level Warcraft commanders, and if they want to set traps to ambush them, it may not be possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of Blood Moon County are about to suffer, and the neighboring counties may not be able to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson, issue a military mobilization order! To wipe out the beast horde in a short period of time, the military power of the entire province must be used. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce's words made Hudson slightly taken aback. He, the military chief of the province, was just a decoration from beginning to end, and he didn't expect that there would be a time to give orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately understood. It seems that Governor Pierce gave up the initiative, but in fact this is another hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how to defend, some noble territories must suffer. Whoever commands the battle will bear the resentment of these unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no standing army in the southeastern province. Hudson seems to have obtained military power, but in fact he has the power to temporarily command the nobles' private troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how hard you try, the private army of nobles is just a private army after all. The lord's order is far more important than the words of a provincial military officer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

For the safety of the workers, Hudson could only order to retreat to important strategic nodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, at this time, \"strategy\" is not strategic, and it doesn't matter at all. After the herd crossed the line of defense, the free-spirited mode started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-level monsters are qualified high-level commanders, but the low-level monsters below are not qualified grassroots officers. It is too embarrassing for them to command the beasts to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In their eyes, the herds under their command are equivalent to food. When I was hungry, I went to grab a few random animals to satisfy my hunger, and the wild beasts would hide away when they saw them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the restraint of the three high-level monsters, maybe the monsters would fight freely. A low-level monster whose average IQ is lower than that of a seven-year-old child does not know what the big picture is\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing the style of the herd, Hudson suddenly found himself nervous for nothing. Even if there were no reinforcements, this mob in front of them would be played to death by nobles from all over the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Bloodmoon County was being besieged by an army of monsters, Hudson didn't take it seriously anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone who should be notified has been notified, and this is not the first time they have encountered a beast horde. The nobles in Blood Moon County have their own countermeasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three high-level monsters that launched the beast tide were all consuming outside the city, and the monsters that invaded other places were all miscellaneous fish, and they couldn't make a difference at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, something is wrong. Ordinary animal hordes don't have such a rigorous organization, let alone clear goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The herd of beasts gathered outside is getting bigger and bigger, and the three high-level monsters have been staying here all the time, as if something in the city is attracting them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he is not as optimistic as Hudson. The animal horde came with a purpose, which is rare in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Governor, I have naturally noticed this question. But if I want to find out the reason, I am afraid that I can only ask the three monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our mounts did not respond, proving that the monsters outside the city were not attracted by natural treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was caused by a certain mercenary group, or maybe a certain nobleman did something important in the Blackstone Mountains, or someone did it deliberately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Hessians want to launch an invasion from here, it is entirely possible to create a beast tide in advance to attract the monsters from the Blackstone Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a good thing that herds of beasts gather outside the city. We just need to hold the city and wait for reinforcements to arrive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by profit. Ever since he negotiated the price with Maxim, Hanhanlong has been going out to hunt monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Probably because he has been with Bear Stearns for a long time, this guy has also learned to sap from behind, shrinking his body and sneaking out every time he makes a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After gaining something, they didn't bring it back immediately. Instead, they chose to bring it back quietly at night under the cover of night, which was not as high-profile as a normal dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the increasing number of Warcraft captives in Hudson's private army camp, I don't know what this guy is doing every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft's nose is very smart. If you catch too many monsters, you will inevitably be noticed by your fellow clansmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no solid evidence, judging from the current reaction of the herd, there is a high probability that the trouble is caused by the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is knowing, but Hudson will definitely not recognize it. If this kind of thing gets out, it won't do him any good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the Kingdom of Hesse is regarded as the biggest threat by the provincial nobles, and they all look at problems with colored glasses, so it is right to blame them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood-earned battle kicked off, another tragic day. Patroling the battlefield from a distance, Hudson sighed secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his eyes, whether it is the soldiers defending the city or the monsters attacking the city, they are all precious wealth. It's a pity that now I can only watch the two be wasted here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No surprises, none of the middle and high-level monster mounts of the nobles appeared on the battlefield, and even if they showed up, they refused to participate in the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, they can fight freely, but at this time, they all choose neutrality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows the reason behind it, the question is: unique Warcraft thinking. Hudson couldn't figure it out, and didn't have the time to delve into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, compared to organized humans, herd attacks are much more random. Coordination does not exist, and even though the roars of the three high-level monsters continue, it cannot change the willfulness of the monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If someone can control the herd and launch a magic attack in an organized way, our city defenses won't last for three hours!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sighed sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the talent of Warcraft is unique, and all of them are born with both magic and martial arts. It is capable of both long-range magic attacks and melee combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you are joking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If monsters of different races could cooperate with each other, they would have already become the overlords of the mainland, and we humans would have nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Creator Gods are fair, endowing them with unique talents, but also depriving them of wisdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all monsters have wisdom, even low-level monsters can break through the blood limit through cultivation and grow into high-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long lifespan, coupled with that impressive talent. It can be said that any low-level monster group has wisdom, and it is also an elf group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even scarier than elves, elves don't have their fertility! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce laughed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no higher-level monsters, because the only limitation of these abnormal creatures is their low fertility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a certain high-level Warcraft race breaks through its own fertility restrictions and can breed one litter after another, it will soon be able to replace the human race as the new overlord of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brief conversation relieved the tension in the headquarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to let the magic crossbows, magic crystal cannons, and trebuchets in the city aim at the herd of beasts and shoot freely.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson took advantage of the situation and ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to keep hiding, the enemy is a monster, and people don't understand the art of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you beat the opponent to death, or you will be killed by the opponent. World of Warcraft is so unpretentious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of roaring artillery fire rang out, and the pressure on the defense of the city dropped instantly. Facing the long-range attack of the defenders, the monsters also launched a magical counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this group of idiots who obviously don't know how to cooperate. It often happens that the magic of one's own beast collides in the air, and it explodes before it hits the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result is: the magic counterattack launched, causing indiscriminate blows to both the enemy and us. After being accidentally injured by some angry monsters, they backhanded their teammates with a critical blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chaos of the scene made Hudson amazed. He doubted very much that if there were not three high-level monsters constantly maintaining order, the herd outside would be able to fight by itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, if a counterattack is launched at this moment, as long as the three high-level monsters are held back, the herd without command will soon collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Master Hudson, the dragon knight, is too stingy with his life, and he doesn't have the slightest idea of ​​taking a chestnut out of the fire. Everyone else has more than enough energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the southeastern provinces are still lacking in high-end power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information obtained by Hudson, there are quite a few magisters and earth knights in the province, but the higher-level great magisters and sky knights are all broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is still unknown whether it is a real fault, or whether the Dalton family has hidden their high-end power. Anyway, no master of this level has ever shown up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of power system comparison, the magister and the earth knight correspond to the seventh-order monsters. There is only one eighth-level monster and two seventh-level monsters outside. Gathering more than a dozen masters to besiege them can also achieve the goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, like Hudson, these big shots also cherish their lives. In case of falling into the siege of the herd, they don't have the ability to retreat completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not issue such an offending order, and the others tacitly did not mention it, and they were all quietly waiting for reinforcements to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, the news of the outbreak of the beast tide in the southeastern province has already spread to the capital. It's just that all the princes and nobles, including Caesar IV, couldn't care less about these \"little things\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of the nobles in the southeastern province asked for help, which is enough to show that the situation is still under control, and there is no need to expend too much energy to pay attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the intelligence gathered from all over the mainland, Caesar IV couldn't help asking: \"Is the mainland war going to break out so soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, judging from the information collected so far, all countries are preparing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Franks have issued an ultimatum to the half-orc kingdom regarding the assassination of the mission. Armies everywhere have also begun to mobilize, and it is only a matter of time before war breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Oprus also clashed with the dwarves. In recent days, more than a hundred dwarves had accidents in the border area between the two countries, and seven nobles of Oprus were also killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the traces left at the scene, the spearheads are all pointing at the other party. At present, the two countries are busy wrangling. It is said that in the border area, two armed conflicts even broke out between the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation is not alleviated, the Oprus Kingdom, which has the support of the Holy See, is likely to launch a war against the Dwarf Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom of Iribia has recently clashed with the ogre tribe. Judging from the inquired news, they are very likely to use troops against the ogre kingdom again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The central part of the mainland is also not peaceful. Armed conflicts broke out between the South Coast Kingdom and the Three-Eyed Tribe; the conflict between the Dante Kingdom and the Trolls escalated; the Hesse Kingdom also confronted the Stone People.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The above mentioned are the conflicts between the human race and several powerful foreign races, and there are more conflicts between some small foreign races and human countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All signs indicate that a new round of continental war is imminent, and now it depends on who will start the fire first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said with a tired face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been very busy. This kind of complicated international situation, whether to fight or not, is the most exhausting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of international conflicts broke out, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to constantly adjust the Kingdom's current foreign policy according to the changing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to work overtime, the key is that you can't produce results. If you are not careful, you will cause trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conflict between the human race and the alien race seems to be enough to stand in line with the human race without thinking. But the reality is very cruel. Standing in line at this moment is not something that can be done by shouting a few words of support, but by taking practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the continental war breaks out, no one can survive alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom seems to have extinct alien races nearby, but the Northern Continent is the place where alien races are most powerful. If there is a fight, the pressure that needs to be faced will only be greater than that of the countries involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, people are well prepared to take the initiative to launch a war, and if they win, they will receive a lot of land wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different when it comes to the Alpha Kingdom. I am surrounded by human countries, even if I win the war and destroy the alien race, I can still get a few enclaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the most ideal state. It is more likely that the human race countries in the central and southern parts of the mainland have wiped out the alien races, and the alien races in the northern continent are still alive and well, and the Alpha Kingdom is doing nothing for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be regarded as white dry, it is nothing more than the disparity between the north and the south of the mainland. Slowly reduced from a mainland power to an ordinary kingdom, it is at an increasingly disadvantageous position in international competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The continental war is breaking out now, which is very detrimental to the kingdom. Even if the human race wins a big victory, we don't have the ability to divide up the spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best for the kingdom to avoid this war as much as possible. No matter how bad it is, we must delay the outbreak of the war to ensure that we will not be dragged into the battlefield in the early stages of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's current finances are still not optimistic. Perhaps the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can take this opportunity to ask governments of various countries for debt relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Private borrowing is not expected to be exempted. As long as government borrowing is wiped out, our pressure can also be greatly reduced. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Marquis Delgado opened his mouth, he showed the qualities that a minister of finance should have, and he was always thinking about the financial problems of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, this may be difficult. We owe the governments of various countries a total of more than 10 million gold coins, which is not a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When making a request at this time, perhaps only a few small parliaments in the northern continent that are close to the elves agree, but they also agree conditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom doesn't want to intervene in the war immediately, so the best option is to find an excuse to stand still. Anyway, with so many countries standing in front of us, the flames of war will not reach our homeland for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be delayed for three to five years and the kingdom recovers, it will be another situation to intervene in the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, vetoed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already great enough, and it is really embarrassing to make unrealistic demands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compare your heart to your heart, anyway, if anyone owes the Alpha Kingdom a large sum of money and suddenly comes to ask for debt relief, he will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you really have no money, the debt can be extended. In the continent of Aslant, there is no country that reneges on its debts before it perishes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for choosing to wait and see the situation, it is not surprising. In the past, it was possible to implement a policy of appeasement against the Kingdom of Hesse, and now it is also possible to stand still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this kind of thing is not exclusive to the Alpha Kingdom. When the orcs invaded earlier, most of the countries in the northern continent did not send troops in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right, the most important thing now is to gain time, and other issues must give way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero, if a continental war breaks out suddenly, how much military pressure will the kingdom face? Are we capable of dealing with it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Archduke Afiero, who was named by Caesar IV, had a look of embarrassment. Before he could answer, his facial expression revealed his true inner thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the international situation is unpredictable. Now that we don't even know who the enemy is, it is difficult for the Ministry of Military Affairs to give a clear answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to deduce a result in advance, I suggest calling the Earl of Hudson to report to the capital. In the military, he has more say. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero decisively threw the pot away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he naturally does not lack professionalism. But he took a pessimistic attitude on this issue, and he really didn't dare to give Caesar IV the guarantee he wanted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The southeastern province is experiencing a wave of beasts, and the Earl of Hudson is presiding over the overall situation, and he will definitely not be able to leave for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs first combined the current situation and made a reasonable response plan. In case the continental war breaks out suddenly, we will be caught off guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, don't be so pessimistic, at least the threat to our south has been lifted for the time being. It is impossible for the three major kingdoms in the central region to provoke a civil war among the human race at the risk of the world during the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the threat of alien races, there are other countries that stand in the way first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs can strengthen communication with the elves, and it is best to sign a binding non-aggression treaty. As long as we can stabilize them, we will win more than half of this war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said bluntly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These countermeasures were all left by Caesar III during his lifetime. After predicting that the continental war was about to break out, he made plans for the future of the Alpha Kingdom in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Caesar IV didn't think so, but he didn't expect that the development of the situation was almost the same as Caesar III's prediction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the time when the Continental War broke out was a little bit earlier, but the development of the situation is still not much different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to find a better solution, Caesar IV could only use the national policy left by his father - \"Nursing health internally, stabilizing elves externally\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson felt the huge battle outside just now in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final result is obvious, and the strong dragon can't stand the siege of the beasts. Facing the prepared herd, Maxim could only fight Sempron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the harvest that Maxim suffered a lot today. In the past, the captives he captured ranged from seven to eight to as many as a dozen, but today there are only two pitiful ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even more tragic: Maxim, who was in a bad mood, threw the monster out as soon as he arrived at the camp, and accidentally killed another one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only harvested a Tier 3 Warcraft, and made himself so embarrassed, Maxim's actions are undoubtedly a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Maxim, is your injury okay?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the circumstances that his own bear can't make a move, the dragon who is in charge of combat power can't have any more problems, otherwise the job of catching monsters won't be able to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, Hudson was also secretly grateful. Fortunately, I was cautious enough to go to the Blackstone Mountains to make troubles without relying on my own monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it would not be Blood Moon County that was besieged by the herd of beasts, but the Mountain Territory. Being harmed by a wave of monsters, even if you don't die, you will have to peel off your skin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the blood on your body belongs to the group of monsters outside. A group of despicable and shameless monsters are playing gang fights shamelessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three wolf cubs, Lord Long remember...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim yelled endlessly, but Hudson pretended not to hear. As a nobleman with integrity, he really couldn't share the same hatred with the red dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' contemptuous eyes pierced Red Dragon's heart even more. Wanting to step forward to argue, the words came to his lips and swallowed back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out to catch a few low-level monsters, they were all so disgraced that I couldn't tell. When the word got out, the face of the giant dragon clan was lost by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing back, Maxim secretly sulked. It's all caused by carelessness, but if you are more vigilant, you won't suffer this kind of loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was so much commotion outside just now, and the news that Maxim went out to catch the monsters probably couldn't be hidden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little analysis, it is estimated that everyone knows why the army of Warcraft is here to smash Bloodmoon County City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Exposure is enough, and Hudson is not at all cowardly. The reasons are all ready-made: hold back the main force of the Warcraft army and prevent them from plundering all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood Moon County can stand firm under the siege of the army of monsters, which is not the same as the castle of the nobles in the countryside. It can also be so strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reinforcements are still on the way, the masters in the province have entered the city one after another in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number of high-level magicians of the same department is not too small, a forbidden spell must be thrown out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no forbidden spells, and the power of combination magic is not bad. With the help of the magic circle, it can also cause a lot of damage to the herd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night cannot stop the army of Warcraft. After being disturbed by the giant dragon, the monsters, who were suffocated, could only vent their grievances on the siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better command the battle, Hudson had to take turns on duty with Governor Pierce. He happened to be on duty tonight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, the reinforcements are almost here, and now the most critical moment has come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a loud bang, a gap in the city wall collapsed. Immediately afterwards, guards came to report: \"My lord, the magic crystal cannon exploded again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic technology also has limits. Continuous shooting, the magic crystal cannon also can't stand the toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No need to ask, Hudson also knows the magic crystal cannon that exploded, and there is a high probability that it was originally produced by the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is assembled with precision parts purchased from the dwarves, it will only break down when it encounters a failure, and it will rarely explode directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, the magic crystal cannon technology of the Alpha Kingdom is pretty good. After fighting for more than ten days, and launching thousands of times, it has already exceeded the limit of endurance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, after the magic crystal cannon has been fired hundreds of times, it must be maintained and replaced with spare parts; after it has been fired 500 times, it must be overhauled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, these were extravagant hopes. In order to provide better fire support, they are all fired as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, send someone to repair the gap in the city wall, and don't give the enemy a chance.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered without changing his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this wave of beasts are all monsters running on the ground. If there was another enemy flying in the sky, Blood Moon County would have collapsed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bright moonlight sprinkled the earth, reflecting the blood on the ground, exuding a terrifying luster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood moon county town shrouded in luster is extraordinarily dazzling. Vaguely, Hudson noticed something was wrong, the city seemed to be alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the vision is nothing more than that, and there is no sign of further changes. After inviting two local nobles to inquire, it was confirmed that it was a normal phenomenon, and then he suppressed his inner anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon County\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon County\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Muttering this ancient noun in his mouth, Hudson couldn't help thinking of the \"Blood Moon Horn\". Intuition told him that there must be a certain connection between the two with similar auras.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the breath on the Horn of Blood Moon is much stronger, while the city of Blood Moon County only has a faint breath of evening. The **** killings are aggravating this atmosphere, but the growth rate is almost unnoticeable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the \"Blood Moon Horn\" was too hot, so he had to trade it out. Even if I want to study it now, I have no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Corubia County, after a series of negotiations, Louis Vuitton III finally chose to give in, and submitted an internal application to the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With an extra fig leaf, the annexation operation started smoothly. With the landing of the flag, the County of Korubia has since become the province of Korubia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Louis Vuitton's earl position was retained, but he was downgraded from a real king to a virtual governor, and most of the royal family's territory was handed over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other aristocratic fiefdoms were left untouched. Affected by the changes in the situation, even the \"July Rebellion\" has temporarily stopped, and a recruitment order has been replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Lelian, the number of recruits above is too huge, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only all adult nobles have to lead troops to join the battle, but also recruit 100,000 troops and 200,000 civilians. This is simply impossible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Louis Vuitton refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he knew that after joining the Kingdom of Hesse, he would suffer a lot, but the small shoes were so obvious, it was too out of line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire province of Korubia has a population of only a million or so, and 300,000 young adults are recruited at one time, obviously even the roots of leeks are not spared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a slight accident on the battlefield, the fate waiting for them will be a serious injury. If they are deliberately targeted again, there will be even fewer people who can escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Louis Vuitton, this is the first battle after the province of Korubia joined the kingdom, you must show your sincerity to prove your loyalty to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    300,000 people may seem difficult, but it is not impossible to get together. It's no secret that nobles from all over the world concealed their population. The province of Korubia, Nuo Da, can't make up 300,000 strong people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adult nobles go to the battlefield, let alone. This is my Hessian tradition. Since he is a nobleman of the Kingdom of Hesse, he must abide by the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relax, Your Excellency. You just need to gather people together, and then I will help you with your ideological work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the great cause of the human race, I believe that except for those scum who colluded with the July Society, the remaining Korubian nobles are willing to make contributions. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Relian said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this smile, in the eyes of Louis Vuitton, it looks like a devil's smile. It may seem ordinary, but it is actually a threat everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Anyone who refuses to cooperate is a cult member.\" This is the first time Louis Vuitton has seen such shameless framing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously he was eliminating dissidents, but he insisted that he was contributing to the cause of the human race, and he was not even given a chance to refute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the 100,000 troops and 200,000 young men are buried on the battlefield, the future Korubia will be the meat on the chopping board and can only be slaughtered by the Kingdom of Hesse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis Lelian, this number is too huge, let's reduce it down!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it is better to mobilize 30,000 troops and 50,000 civilians instead, so that everyone can accept it, and it will be more conducive to the balance of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Louis Vuitton strives for the Road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can match the strength of the troops mobilized by the provinces, even if it suffers a little loss, everyone can accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all younger brothers of their own family. Although the team was forced to disband due to the situation, there is still a lot of love. After joining the Kingdom of Hesse, these people are still his foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Louis Vuitton can see it, and so can the Kingdom of Hesse. Such a move was made to reduce the power of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without depleting their strength first, it is not so easy to complete the big purge with just a \"rebellion in July\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the mobilization target of 300,000 cannot be lowered. If you are unable to complete it, you can only let the Kingdom Army complete it for you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that at that point, everyone's face will not be good. Especially the July meeting case, it's not over yet! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Reliant's words completely shocked Louis Vuitton. When his temper came up, he simply sent out the bad Dafa again, and left in a huff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make a fuss, do it, if you can't stop it, just ignore it. Anyway, it is impossible for him to do such a self-destructive thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the successive mobilization of the nations of the Terran, the pace of the Continental War is approaching. Naturally, such a big movement cannot be hidden from the aliens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Castle of Ashes, the dwarf king sitting high on the throne, asked full of doubts: \"The Oprus people are crazy, what good will it do them to fight with us now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the number one arms dealer, the Dwarf Kingdom, which is exported to all parties at the same time, has been able to run freely until now, and its strength is naturally extraordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the previous continental wars, most of the alien alliances ended in failure, but the Dwarf Kingdom has always had the upper hand against the Oprus Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the threat of several human nations in the middle of the country behind them, which restrained their large number of troops, the Kingdom of Oprus would have been defeated by them long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Oprusians have won the support of the Holy See this time, and they concluded a secret covenant just two days ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific content is unknown, but the above content is most likely aimed at us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries of the human race are preparing for war, and it is obvious that they intend to launch a new round of continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Oprus continues to provoke at this time, probably trying to force us to act first in order to seek moral justice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Milf said with a flushed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can tell at a glance that this is just off the wine table. If it is put in other forces, drinking alcohol during working hours is definitely a taboo, but it can only be said to be the norm in the Dwarf Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the dwarf king himself reeked of alcohol. As if carved into the bones of the genes, all dwarves are drunk and happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn human beings, can't they just relax? It's only been peaceful for a long time, and they want to start a continental war again!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's see, human beings will be destroyed by war sooner or later. For such a warlike race, they should be born in the abyss **** and spend all day with demons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why are you silent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How are you going to deal with the provocations of human beings? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the dwarf king's roar, everyone was speechless. Where they don't speak, it is clear that they have no chance to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the boss curses endlessly, how can the younger brother jump out and steal the limelight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, although the dwarves are upright, they do not include these bureaucrats who play politics. If you complain about your boss, you can just think about it in your heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the soldiers are here to cover up the water and the earth. Since the human race wants to start a war, we should fight it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's not the first time. Since the human race became the overlord of the continent, the frequency of continental wars has become higher and higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that after the division of human beings, this bad day would end, but they didn't expect them to become more warlike.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't stop it, see you on the battlefield. A great race of dwarves who will never be afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Aaron said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the toughness of the mouth, but it's still hard to hide the anxiety in the tone. I really don't think the dwarves are cowards, they are also a fighting race, but the alien alliance always loses in the mainland war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After repeated failures, all ethnic groups in the mainland have lost confidence, and now they have a headache when they mention the mainland war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the past two hundred years, except for the orc empire who dared to invade the human race, no other race dared to take the initiative to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire, which is the most warlike, was beaten to the ground by the human race not long ago, which invisibly reduced another force for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had known that the human race was going to launch a continental war, they should have joined the attack when the orcs invaded the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just a thought. In all previous continental wars, the orc empire has been clamoring fiercely, and in the end they stopped in the Alpha Kingdom, and did not provide them with substantial help at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this, they wouldn't sell their teammates, they sold it so simply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Orc Empire recovers quickly. Especially those cannon fodder races, no matter how many people die, they will be a hero again in a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they sell their allies, once the continental war breaks out, the orcs will still join the war spontaneously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without recovering the orc prairie, relying on the barren mountains in the north alone cannot support as many tribes as the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since human beings want to fight, let's prepare for war! Pass the order, and from now on, any weapons are prohibited from wandering in the human race, including previous orders, and all deliveries are now postponed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moi, immediately send people to contact all ethnic groups on the mainland to prepare them for war. Especially on the side of the elves, we should pay more attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warning them not to paddle too much, if we fail, they cannot survive alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race in the Northern Continent is the weakest. Not long ago, they were harmed by orcs and are in a period of weakness. Such a good opportunity cannot be missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time they must hit the middle of the continent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During speaking, the dwarf king couldn't help showing a hint of envy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the dwarves were not in the Fourth World War, but in the Northern Continent, where the human race is weak, they would definitely be able to come back this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the countries in the northern continent of the human race can be destroyed in one fell swoop, and the human race countries in the middle of the country can be threatened strategically, the strategic passivity of the foreign race alliance will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, reinforcements are here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stayed up all night, just fell asleep, was awakened from sleep, Hudson was also angry. After a long while, I finally reacted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the reinforcements have arrived, it means the beginning of a major counter-offensive. Governor Pierce, who has a full understanding of his ability to use troops, will naturally not add drama to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time he made a misjudgment on the grassland, which caused serious damage to the nobles in the province, which made everyone have opinions on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is another accident, no matter how deep the Dalton family is, it will not be able to withstand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I'll go there right away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The strong elemental breath can be felt even by people who have never learned magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Magic crystal mine!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The murderous look in his eyes has exposed his true inner thoughts. The Viscount Ottum on the side was even more frightened and trembling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic Crystal Mine, this kind of strategic resource, cannot be owned by a little viscount. Small magic crystal mines with low reserves are fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But judging from the movements exposed in front of him, this is undoubtedly a large magic crystal mine. Viscount Ottum dared to hide and mine something that even a noble like the Dalton family could not swallow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more important is that this kind of private collection is not just a day or two, but may have lasted for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to cover up the mining movement, the county town was moved to the mine, and a magic circle was added to block the breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the ancestors of Viscount Ottum also gave birth to great people. This kind of handwriting is not something that an ordinary middle-class noble can accomplish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, let's deal with this problem after defeating the herd!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the anger of Governor Pierce, Hudson is much calmer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has only risen for a few days. If the ancestors of the Viscount Ottum were able to hide the magic crystal mine, this thing would have been divided up by others, and it would not be his turn to take a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the right time to expose it, regardless of whether it is handed over to the kingdom, or the nobles in the southeastern provinces join forces to hide and mine, Hudson can get a share of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He agreed with his lips, but deep down in his heart, Governor Pierce was bleeding. Even if he discovered this magic crystal mine three to five years in the morning, he would not be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two strong players stand side by side, how can one of them dominate and score more points?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If eyes could kill, Viscount Altum would have been torn to pieces. This is not only digging at the foot of the kingdom, but also digging at the foundation of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large magic crystal mine is an important strategic resource for any big power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific reserves and quality of magic spar are not yet known, but it can be seen from the movement at the scene that it is definitely not ordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mystery that Blood Moon County was equipped with a large number of magic crystal cannons has now been solved. Guys who don't lack magic crystals can naturally squander them wantonly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The whole army goes out, pinching the herd front and back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by Hudson's order, the **** battle broke out in an all-round way, and the sound of killing resounded all over the world for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a dragon knight, Hudson was forced to take the lead and rushed to the forefront of the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, you idiot don't want to fight, rush out from here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the red dragon leading him straight to the herd, Hudson was full of anger. If it weren't for the fact that this guy is usually second-guess, he would have suspected that he was deliberately defrauding his master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Curse the curse, the effect is still very good. The giant dragon rampaged in the herd, making the already chaotic herd even more unbearable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the three high-level monsters command, they can't stop the herd from becoming more and more chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the chaos of the herd, the human masters who followed immediately expanded this advantage, trying to divide the herd into two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three high-level monsters who were eager to try, failed to rush up after all. Without the cooperation of the herd, just one eighth-level monster + two seventh-level monsters can't beat an adult dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that the situation was over, the three leading wolf cubs quickly left the battlefield and headed straight for the Warcraft Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trees fell and the monkeys scattered, and the herd without the command of a high-level monster quickly collapsed under the impact of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the money-obsessed Maxim became more eager to fight and chased after him directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The steady Hudson has left the Red Dragon and left the battlefield with Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many monsters participating in the battle, but for the entire Blackstone Mountain Range, only a small part of them are here now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The monster that launched this beast horde was only an eighth-rank monster at the highest level, which couldn't represent the Blackstone Mountain Range at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson remembered that Bear Stearns said that in the depths of the Blackstone Mountains, there are still ninth-level monsters entrenched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current battle is nothing more than cleaning up the monsters in the nearby area. If you go deep into the Black Rock Mountain Range, it is also dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this danger is for Hudson. The rough-skinned and thick-skinned Maxim, even if he couldn't beat others in the past, he could still run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among all races, dragons are the most balanced and top-notch wave of talent. Regardless of speed, attack, defense, or land, sea and air combat, they are all at the top level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There may be monsters that surpass them in unilateral attributes, but no one can surpass them in all aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Bear Stearns, which Hudson carefully cultivated, can only rule the roost on land. If you change the battlefield, it will be the fate of being completely abused by Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood Moon County, in a remote small courtyard, a white-haired old man cursed endlessly: \"I can't live through this day!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our business has just started, and we have encountered a beast tide that is rare in decades. This time, we will definitely lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The girl in red on the side smiled and said, \"Grandpa, you are possessed by a moldy god. Wherever you go, accidents will happen!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speaker has no intention, but the listener has intention. The white-haired old man complained secretly in his heart, he was only busy doing things, but he ignored the flaws he had revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these things on the surface have nothing to do with his old man who is half buried in the ground, nobles don't need evidence to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they realize that every time a big event happens, there will be a group of them haunting them, they will immediately do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you catch the wrong one, it's just a few low-level merchants, who will stand up for them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop talking nonsense, you are an adult, why are you still so naughty!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I've had bad financial luck recently. When I was lucky in the past few years, I made a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looks like I need to find someone to marry you off as soon as possible, otherwise my old bones will be tossed to death by you sooner or later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The constant complaints on the mouth and the kindness in the eyes still cannot be concealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a cult organization, there are also times of silence. During the orc invasion a few years ago, the Skull and Bones settled down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they have a big picture, but that the funders behind the scenes don't let them do things. Cult organizations that don't know the direction of the wind, all shipwrecked in the wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the major forces get ruthless, no matter how deep they hide, they will be able to find them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made this an extraordinary world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no clue, there is still a divination. Of course, the great prophecy of the Holy See also has the same effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Future events cannot be accurately predicted, but it is not difficult to investigate past events. Unless there is a master who disrupts the thread of fate, it will be difficult to fool the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like the previous assassination of Caesar III, it was cut off from the beginning and the end. No matter how the Alpha Kingdom investigated, no breakthrough could be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the handicrafts of the top powers, and the Skull and Bones do not have this kind of ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man has been able to live smoothly until now, thanks to the talent of his granddaughter, who has avoided countless dangers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, I don't want to marry, I want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before she finished speaking, the girl in red changed her face and said, \"Grandpa, pack up your things and leave, or it will be too late!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guna, are you sure you feel right? There are monsters outside the city, let's go out now...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, the soaring vision went straight to the clouds, and the old man couldn't help exclaiming: \"Magic Crystal Mine!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a flash he understood. The news that Xueyue County City is located on the magic crystal mine has been exposed, which means that this place has become a place of right and wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Will the nobles in the southeastern province hand over the magic crystal mine to the kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these people don't want to hand it over, they can only block the news. As witnesses, I'm afraid they will never leave Blood Moon County in their lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    House arrest is a trivial matter, the key is that these noble lords have to investigate everyone's identities, and their identities cannot withstand scrutiny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a problem is discovered, it is considered good to send it to mining, and it is more likely to die directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, don't worry about the magic crystal mines. Those belong to the nobles, and they won't give you a gold coin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone called for reinforcements just now, and the defenders should start counterattacking now. The herd outside is no match for the regular army, and it is only a matter of time before they are defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the chaos on the battlefield, this is our last chance to leave. Otherwise, when the aristocrats react, they won't be able to leave!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop talking nonsense, I'll go find the little wolf, hasn't he had milk yet? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Guna had already carried a wolf cub out of the house. It's just that this young wolf is different from ordinary wolves. It looks more like a dog than a wolf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pure white hair, full of aristocratic temperament, it can be seen at a glance that it is of noble birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's right, it's another part of picking up monsters halfway. When they were passing by the edge of the Blackstone Mountain Range, a mercenary group and a pack of wolves started fighting, and this little guy scurry into Guna's carriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the variety is extraordinary, they brought it out and arrived at Blood Moon County all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing all in a daze, hurry up and pack your things, you can't understand people's words!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, money is something outside of the body. Bring the essentials, these goods are not needed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said with a painful face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years, he has long been addicted to acting. Most of the time, I am a small businessman who is a philistine, including the decision to give up the goods now, which is really heartbreaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sun is shining all over the earth, reflecting the blood on the ground, it looks extraordinarily creepy. It's like taking people to hell, and the killing atmosphere is everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wreckage of broken arms all over the ground is still telling the cruelty of war. The polite vultures kept wandering in the sky, but they didn't come down to **** food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destined to disappoint them, the laborers hiding in the city have come out to clean up the battlefield at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bones of one's own people should be collected, and according to the tradition of the Aslante continent, priests will preside over the burial.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dead monsters and beasts are the best meat supplements, there is absolutely no reason to give up, there is no room for them to get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After counting the casualties, everyone's face was not good. Just one beast swarm still caused tens of thousands of casualties, even though most of the losses were serfs, it still slapped everyone in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most miserable ones were the small nobles in Blood Moon County, who suffered heavy losses under the scourge of the herd. Although the blood moon county attracted firepower, five knights and one baron were still breached by the herd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The castle was broken, needless to say the people inside. Most of the casualties were contributed by these six destroyed territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no interest in the ownership of these territories. It doesn't matter if there are survivors inheriting it, or it doesn't matter if it is divided up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a land without population, he has no love at all. What's more, it's still an enclave, and it's a waste of resources to get it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory can not be disputed, but the magic crystal mine cannot be given up. This thing is a rare commodity, and it can be traded normally in normal times, but once it enters the war time, it will be difficult to obtain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire Alpha Kingdom, two large magic crystal mines, seven or eight medium-sized magic crystal mines, and dozens of tiny magic crystal veins were discovered on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal mine in Blood Moon County is the third large-scale magic crystal mine on the bright side of the kingdom, and it is also the only large-scale magic crystal mine in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, this is the only magic crystal mine he can reach. If you make a mistake in the past, you don't know when you will have to wait for the next time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The beast tide is over, and the remaining monsters have retreated to the Blackstone Mountains, so the threat has been lifted. Now let's talk about the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to resuming the construction of the Blood Moon defense line as soon as possible, what should be done with the destroyed territories? How to deal with the aftermath of the magic crystal mine? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson turned his attention to Governor Pierce. The war is over, and the power of discourse has shifted again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no magic crystal mine, it doesn't matter who will preside over the aftermath meeting. But the reality is that if there is no if, the Dalton family must not give up the dominance at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson is right, the aftermath issue should indeed be put on the agenda. Viscount Ottum, don't you want to say something?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Governor Pierce's words fell, everyone's eyes focused on Viscount Ottum. Hiding the magic crystal mine is a serious crime, and now that it is exposed, you will have to peel off your skin if you don't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Governor, please forgive me! I really don't want to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the reason came to his lips, he swallowed it back. As the owner of Blood Moon County, they put the county on the mines as a cover. If they didn't know that someone was secretly mining, it would be an insult to everyone's IQ.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these things were done by the ancestors. In his generation, he just continued the tradition of his ancestors, and that is also to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You must be very clear about the crime of hiding or stealing magic crystal mines. Whether you did it or your ancestors did it, the result is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules of the kingdom, if you report the magic crystal mine as a lord, you will get 20% of the mining income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the construction time of Blood Moon County, you probably have been stealing ore veins for hundreds of years. With such a big matter, no one can protect you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He spoke loudly, but Hudson knew that Governor Pierce had no intention of killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Altum deserves to die, but the southeast province has no right to execute a fiefdom viscount, and must report to the kingdom's aristocratic council for approval.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The charges were settled, and the news of the magic crystal mine was exposed. When the time comes, the kingdom will take advantage of the trend to take the magic crystal mine back to the central government, and everyone will not be able to get anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Viscount Altum is spared, it will not be easy to keep the magic crystal mine. The previous anomaly can be seen in a radius of dozens of miles. There are too many insiders, and it is only a matter of time before the secret is leaked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, I am willing to commit crimes and make meritorious deeds!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did you commit crimes and make meritorious deeds!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lord Hudson, please raise your hand!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, Viscount Altum begged all the powerful nobles present. In order to preserve the family inheritance, in order to preserve his life, he also worked hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The vision that erupted just now can be seen in a radius of tens of miles, and it is estimated that the news has already spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the capital sends people to intervene, not only will you die, but your family will also die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of our colleagues, as long as you explain the matter clearly, we will help you figure out a solution together! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Hudson said this not only to Viscount Ottum, but also to all the nobles present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crime or not, that's just a small problem, the key is how to deal with the interests of the magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secrecy is impossible. Visions appeared in a radius of tens of miles, and tens of thousands of people saw them. Even if everyone issued a password immediately, it could only delay the leak of the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if ordinary people are ignorant, there are so many nobles in the southeast province, it is impossible without the king's eyeliner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of everyone, no one dares to pass on news for the time being, but it is impossible for everyone to stay together forever. Once the team is disbanded, the news will definitely reach the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is exposed that Viscount Altum is mining the magic crystal mine privately, but it does not mean that he is the only one involved. At least in the eyes of the king, he would not believe that such a big deal could be done by a middle-class nobleman alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once in-depth investigation, it is either **** or shit, things are not clear at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the vassals of Viscount Altum, if they say they don't know, no one will believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay for emerging nobles like the Koslow family, but the Dalton family will definitely not be able to tell, and the capital will definitely suspect that they are involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason. After so many years of private mining of the magic crystal mine, it stands to reason that the Viscount Otum family, which has gained a lot of wealth, should have risen long ago, but they are still dawdling among the middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the strength shown on the bright side, not only have they not risen in the past 100 years, but they have declined a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the addition of a little more magic crystal cannons in Blood Moon County, Hudson didn't notice any difference between them and ordinary middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, thank you for your understanding!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is a long story, so I will briefly introduce it. The matter of the magic crystal mine can be traced back to three hundred years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During a battle to suppress the Blood Moon Sect, the ancestors discovered this magic crystal mine, and they found a way to operate it and took root here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that this was just a miniature mine vein, which could make a fortune. I didn't expect that the more mining, the higher the production capacity of the vein, and the quality of the magic spar produced is also constantly improving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that things are not good, we are already on the ropes, so we can only bite the bullet and continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the efforts of our ancestors, we finally thought of a way to build a city on the mine veins to cover up the existence of the magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was alright at first, but relying on the wealth of the magic crystal mine, the family strength grew rapidly. But this kind of good thing, in the third year after the city was built, it took a sharp turn for the worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if cursed, accidents happened to the older clansmen. Especially in the last 80 years, no one in our family can live past 60 years old, and not many people can live to 50 years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have cultivated to the level of an earth knight or a magister, you have passed the sixty-year-old threshold. Either there was an accident outside, or he died suddenly without a trace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is life shortened, but even the younger generation is prone to premature death. Counting the collateral descendants, the family members have dropped from more than 800 at the peak to more than 100 now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kong has a lot of wealth, but suffers from the limitation of lifespan. The sharp drop in population has limited our development, and the strength of the family has declined instead of rising over the years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to find a solution, we also asked many people to help, but unfortunately no one can see the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even clansmen who were born in other places have never returned to the territory, and they cannot escape the curse of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After years of investigation, we also suspect that we have entered the magic crystal mine. For the future of the family, we have stopped mining in the past ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the news has been leaked now, if everyone wants this magic crystal mine, we can give up the mine for free! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Altum said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expression seemed as if this magic crystal mine was a scourge, and he wanted to throw it out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is unknown for the time being, but the fact that the family of the Viscount Altum, who has acquired a lot of wealth, has not risen but declined in strength does make sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the extraordinary world, old antiques represent the heritage. A strong man who could live to be one or two hundred years old can't even live to be sixty years old now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hope of being born strong is almost shattered, but the number of tribesmen has also dropped sharply. With the combination of double unfavorable factors, it is only a problem for the family to prosper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this little episode, the original angry eyes of everyone disappeared, replaced by hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the magic crystal mine is really cursed, it is a hot potato. Although wealth is precious, life is more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Altum, I hope what you said is true. We need to investigate further. If there is any deception, you can wipe your neck yourself!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a veteran in the political arena, and making up stories is a skill for eating. In order to survive, there is nothing they cannot do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's better to hit the sun than to choose the day. Almost all the masters in the province are here now, and the curse of waiting can't do anything to us. Why don't we go to the magic crystal mine to check to confirm the authenticity.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After obtaining a large amount of knowledge inheritance, he is no longer so afraid of the legendary \"curse\". That kind of killing people thousands of miles away is just a legend after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real curse still has trigger conditions, and it has to bear the corresponding backlash, more like an equivalent exchange of all forces\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To curse and kill so many nobles in the southeast province, I am afraid that people who are proficient in curses from all over the continent will gather together, and they will not have the ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The curse placed on the magic crystal mine a hundred years ago, or even hundreds of years ago, no matter how powerful it is, its power will be greatly reduced after the passage of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, Viscount Ottum's family has already carried the thunder, and the power of the curse may have been exhausted. Even if it is not over yet, Hudson is confident that he can keep the curse from sticking to his body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Altum, how did the curse come about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it true that anyone who has entered the mine will be recruited, or that those who live in Blood Moon County will be unlucky?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, in the past few decades, not only people in your family can't live to be sixty years old, but the number of old people in Blood Moon County is also very small, and most of them are outsiders. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be careless. Hudson has a dragon, a bear, and two strong sanctuary powerhouses. Even the strongest curse warlock in the whole continent can't escape the fate of being backlashed. Naturally, you can ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He, the governor, doesn't have such a thick shield. If he encounters a powerful curse, he still has to be hit when he should be hit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to go out for an adventure, you must bring the family's curse-proof magic props, and you must not act without authorization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dalton family has hundreds of members, but there are only three or two seedlings in the direct line. Once one or two are cursed and die, it will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce, who thought he had seen through Hudson's sinister intentions, immediately became gloomy, and even his interest in the magic crystal mine dropped drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, rest assured, the power of the curse is not that terrifying. We have done experiments, as long as the magic crystal mine has not been mined, ordinary people living in Blood Moon County will not be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of old people in the city is small, mainly due to the miasma emanating from the magic crystal mine. This situation has happened everywhere, and almost all miners have short lifespans. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if Viscount Ottum didn't explain, but this explanation made everyone even more panicked, and they decided to participate without any hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, this Blood Moon County can't stay anymore. Even if you go out to live in the wilderness, you can't live in this ghost place for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is still a lot of aftermath work. Everyone left together, and the follow-up work is not easy to carry out. Regarding the problem of the magic crystal mine, please trouble Earl Hudson to take someone away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all for more efficient handling of work, it's definitely not because he was cowardly. If he had time, he would definitely lead the team there himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, let's divide the work like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Altum, you lead the way. Priest Debon, Magister Yuri, Magister Antal, Knight Kotro... Follow me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson directly named.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the masters present were not missing, a ninth-level giant dragon + a ninth-level earth bear + more than twenty seventh-level powerhouses, and a group of soldiers guarding them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the lineup, they are all capable of confronting an evil **** head-on. If the Lord of Skeletons came to the continent of Aslante, he could send them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the evil gods are waste materials, but mainly because under the restrictions of the rules, the strongest strength that all non-native creatures cannot exert in this world is the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also can only exert the power of the sanctuary level, relying on the advantages of their own realm comprehension, the fighting power of the gods is still far stronger than that of ordinary sanctuaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the prerequisite is: after adapting to the rules of the world. When it just arrived, its combat power was just that, and if it was a little careless, it would be a legend of slaughtering gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the destiny of the gods, most of the time the gods come out for activities are incarnations, and very few real bodies come out to do things in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risks are controllable, and Hudson doesn't mind showing a little pride. What's more, it seems to be presiding over the investigation of the curse issue, which also involves the distribution of benefits from the magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal situation, the Koslow family will get half of the Dalton family's share at most, or only one-third of the other party's share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. There are 15 counties in the entire southeastern province, and seven of them are guards from the Dalton family. More than 30% of the land in the province is fiefdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to quarrel at the provincial meeting, it is 1vs7; to be reasonable, if someone just pulls a sheriff over there, he can control the decision-making power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really a political confrontation, there is only one way left for Hudson: expand the problem and bring it to the provincial noble council for discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is still at a disadvantage, at least when he is scolding, he has a group of younger brothers as helpers, so that he will not be at a disadvantage from the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally a proposal won the support of neutral nobles, and it is not without chance to turn the tables. It's just that the probability of this is really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of his own reputation, Hudson decisively chose to take advantage of the situation. Every time he spoke, he took advantage of the \"general trend\" to the extreme, making it impossible to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Proposals passed again and again, seemingly inconspicuous. However, his position in everyone's mind is still subtly changing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Invisibly created a political illusion for everyone: Master Hudson has a very important voice in the province, and the two families jointly hold the highest voice in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like now, Governor Pierce did not object, and others also chose to acquiesce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because in the minds of many people at this moment, Hudson and Governor Pierce are on the same level, and the rest of the nobles are all lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Governor Pierce does not make a clear statement, none of the county guards present dare to take the lead in confronting Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously everyone represents a county, and a look from Hudson can shut them up, but no one thinks there is a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this invisible penetration of influence can be traced back to the period of the orc invasion. When he was the coach of the Kingdom, Hudson had already established his prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The classic scene of catching the five nobles of the Northland as their grandsons is very deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the stimulation to the witnesses is not so great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Viscount Ottum all the way to the back garden, he moved a rockery, and a passage appeared in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Advance along the secret road all the way, the road gradually widened, like an ant nest, surrounded by large and small mines, supported by artificially built columns in the middle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the cobwebs made up in the sky and the dust on the ground, it can be seen that no one has been here for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose a mine at random to enter, shuttle all the way to the depths of the mine, look at the spar on the rock wall, and after snapping a piece casually, Hudson frowned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you see any problems?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, everything is normal here, there is no trace of evil power at all, it doesn't look like someone has cast a curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe you can look elsewhere. This is a large magic crystal mine. Even if someone casts a curse, it is difficult to cover such a large area. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magister Yuri's answer made Hudson shake his head slightly. No problem is often the biggest problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having devoured so many magic spar, Hudson has also done some research on magic spar. The magic spar in his hand seems to be of good quality, but the energy fluctuations are quite different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the energy fluctuations on the magic spar, it feels that this is not a naturally formed mineral vein, but more like the power instilled artificially.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Artificially manufacturing magic spar is theoretically no problem, and there are also successful cases in the laboratory. That's a nice step forward, regardless of cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that was just a magic spar, not a magic crystal mine. The principles of the two are similar, but the problem is when it comes to specific operations, where can I find such a large amount of energy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let's investigate separately. But everyone, be careful, the mine here has not been used for some days, and it may cause a collapse if there is too much movement!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson kindly reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the mine cave collapsed, it would be a tragedy for their group. Maybe Hudson can use the dragon as a pioneer to rush out, and others can only ask for luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After so many years, the power of the curse may have been exhausted long ago. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all what he expected. If it was so easy to find the problem, the Viscount Ottum family would not be in this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the blessing of abundant resources, even middle-of-the-road talents can pile up into geniuses. Even with the lifespan limit, the Viscount Ottum's family did not lack masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now choose to put it badly and no longer mine the magic crystal mine. It is also a last resort after generations of failed efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it has any effect is still unknown. Anyway, Hudson has never heard of anyone in the Viscount Ottum family holding a 60th birthday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Lord Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Altum said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the source of the curse cannot be found, there will be no way to lift it. If the current situation continues, even if this crisis is overcome, it will only be a matter of time before the family is finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any nonsense, Hudson led the team away directly. Although he didn't find anything, his intuition told him that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After exiting the mine and taking another breath of fresh air, Hudson asked with mental strength:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, Maxim, have you found any problems?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With regard to the understanding of mysterious power, the long-lived race is obviously more dominant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Blood Moon Sect more than three hundred years ago is an ancient history for human beings, but it is only a short period of life for extraordinary creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns and Maxim are not knowledgeable masters, but they have finally stepped into the sanctuary level and stood at the pinnacle of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even beings of the same level, it is difficult to hide from them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is an evil aura hidden under the mine, similar to that horn bottle, as if born from the same source.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just sealed by someone, and this evil aura was firmly locked underground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best not to act rashly, if any big guy is released, it will not end well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that cute expression, which destroys the solemn atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You mean that this magic crystal mine is not naturally generated, but artificially created?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic crystal mines can be manufactured artificially. Once the news is spread, the whole world will undergo drastic changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally limited by the high price of magic crystals, the magic technology that could not be promoted will surely become popular across the continent in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the war mode will have to be rewritten from then on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I didn't feel the source of the crystal. There is a high probability that this magic crystal mine was not born naturally. But it is not right to say that it is artificial, it should be a coincidence!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have mentioned in my inheritance memory that the burial ground after the fall of the strongest may form a magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that certain conditions need to be met, and the probability of birth is not very high. Otherwise, there might be magic crystal mines everywhere on Long Island. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Bear Stearns finished speaking, Maxim on the side jumped out unwillingly to complain:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Big stupid bear, you have some knowledge. But you are wrong about one thing, our Dragon Island has the most magic crystal mines in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, what are you looking at me for?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I warn you, don't make bad ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the magic crystal mines on Dragon Island are concentrated in the Dragon Tomb, and anyone who dares to approach it will be killed without mercy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if our dragon gets close, we will be severely punished. Only those ancient dragons and dragon kings can put their lairs there. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson rolled his eyes angrily, he is not a fool, how could he go for Long Island's idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention that there are magic crystal mines everywhere, even if there are artifacts everywhere, he dare not go to pick them up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    God knows how many old antiques exist in the long-lived race of giant dragons. After these perverts moved to Long Island, there was only one word—invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the power of all the races in the continent of Aslante is concentrated, they may not be able to touch the door of others. To organize an expeditionary force is to deliver snacks to the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, I know that your Dragon Island is rich and rich, but this does not affect you as a poor dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this time to show off your wealth, why not think about it, when will you be able to pay off the debt you owe me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Learn from Bear Stearns. He is still a child, and already owns hundreds of thousands of acres of land, thousands of cattle and sheep...every day there is endless honey and animal milk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at you again, you are a dragon who is hundreds of years old, and you still can't do anything. Even the resources for daily practice have to be financed by borrowing money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this goes on, your Dragonborn will just find a Warcraft general in the future! No female dragon can take a fancy to a poor ghost like you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to find excitement in front of him, you have to bear the corresponding consequences. When it comes to stalking people, the fledgling Maxim is still too immature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't go too far. Maxim is still young, only a few hundred years old, and there are still infinite possibilities in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is more appropriate to say these words to him after he has passed a thousand years. However, with the lifespan of you humans, there is a high probability that you will not be able to wait for that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But don't worry, Hudson, I have recorded what I just said with a photo stone. When it's his thousand-year-old birthday, I'll show it to him. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing Hudson's gloomy face, Bear Stearns, who realized that something was wrong, hurriedly said: \"Hudson, don't get me wrong. I don't mean anything by saying this, but I just want to remind you to work hard practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the history of the human race, it is not unheard of that people can live for hundreds of years. With your talent, there is still hope for hard work. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A brat is a brat, and he offended both of them as soon as he opened his mouth. Fortunately, Hudson has developed the ability to \"landslide in front of his eyes without changing his face\", which can strongly control his emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim on the side couldn't do it anymore. The successive blows made him suspicious of Long Sheng. If it weren't for Hudson, the master, who was pressing him, he would definitely fight Bear Stearns with his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop talking nonsense, since it is sealed, what is the power of the curse?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"sixty limit\" longevity curse seems to be a common thing, but the Viscount Altum family has not been able to solve it for hundreds of years, so he can't help but pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no way to solve the curse problem, Hudson would rather throw this magic crystal mine out than touch this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Relax, Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guy below is in a very bad state. He has been worn down by the power of time for countless years. He may be finished at any time, and he has no spare energy to release the curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called curse is nothing more than the evil spirit they exude. Although this energy is very weak, it will still affect longevity over time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those idiots built their homes on the mine, and were infected by evil spirits every day. They only lost some life spans, and they were lucky not to degenerate into dark creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they stay here forever, it is estimated that in a few hundred years, they will all become dark creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not absolute, as long as you break through the limit of life and reach the sanctuary that you humans call, you will basically not be affected by these evil spirits. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Bear Stearns' explanation, Hudson felt relieved. The speed of evil infection is so slow, there must be no problem in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, such work as mining does not require him to do it himself. All the problems can be solved by drawing some of the slaves who built the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was a curse, it was given to the orcs. What does it matter to him, Master Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sixty-year-old life limit is only for nobles. Ordinary freemen and serfs, few of whom could live so long, did not feel this kind of trouble at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Polluted blood, that is only a small problem. As long as you leave here, you will be able to get rid of the influence in a hundred or eighty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the research continues, these secrets of the Viscount Altum family will be discovered sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the location of the magic crystal mine was exposed. Whether it was nationalized or divided up by the nobles in the southeastern provinces, this windfall has nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the city of Blood Moon County, in a luxurious tent, the issue of spoils was directly brought to the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing all parties arguing endlessly, Hudson just closed his eyes and rested. Paying attention to aristocratic etiquette is only because the temptation is not strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reserves of the magic crystal mine in front of me are not so rich. If you mine with all your strength, you can easily get a net profit of millions of gold coins every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is willing to give up such a large fortune. What's more, magic spar is different from ordinary commodities, it is also an important cultivation resource and strategic resource.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, everyone. It is difficult to keep the news of the magic crystal mine secret for a long time. Instead of entangled in the distribution of the magic crystal mine, it is better to think about how to deal with the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the laws of the Kingdom, all magic crystal mines belong to the central government, and we have no right to mine them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interests are touching, even if the problem of the curse is not resolved, it can't stop everyone's enthusiasm for the magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem facing everyone right now is the Kingdom, a stumbling block.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal mines discovered in the past are not within the sphere of influence of our own, so everyone naturally supports nationalization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the Magic Crystal Mine arrived at the door, and it involved vital interests, so everyone couldn't be so magnanimous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Magic Crystal Mine cannot be handed over!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our southeast province has changed from the rear to the front line. When war breaks out in the future, the demand for magic spar will definitely be a huge number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It depends entirely on the deployment of the kingdom, and I am afraid it cannot meet the demand. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An impatient young nobleman spoke first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't care how nonsense the reason is, it's better than having no reason. It's just that these reasons are obviously not sufficient, and they can't convince the kingdom at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is strong and the central government grabs it hard, ordinary small and medium-sized nobles may not feel much, but the pressure on Governor Pierce will be great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, the ownership of the magic crystal mine has been expressly stipulated in the kingdom's laws. It is legally unreasonable to forcibly refuse the kingdom's nationalization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the matter gets to a standstill, the kingdom's standing army will come in directly and forcefully nationalize the magic crystal mine. We can't raise our troops to rebel! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kayo hurriedly jumped out and objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the interests of the magic crystal mine are great, there are too many people participating in the cake distribution, and the specific distribution is in the hands of individuals, and the number is actually limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Dalton family, it is good to have this wealth, and not having this wealth will not affect their status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not the boss, it is necessary to protect the interests of the younger brothers. If it is not good, Governor Pierce will just let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, as long as it can delay the development speed of the Koslow family, this strategic abandonment is worthwhile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is of course not possible to raise troops to rebel; it is also not advisable to hand over the magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the outside world only suspects that there is a magic crystal mine in Blood Moon County, and there is no substantive evidence, so there is nothing we can do for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone insists that the magic crystal mine does not exist, it will be difficult for the Kingdom to find out anything in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Blood Moon County as a cover, as long as we act carefully and don't sell out the mined magic spar, it will be difficult for the kingdom to catch us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or simply use the plague as an excuse to seal off the Blood Moon County for dozens of miles, prohibiting any outsiders from entering or leaving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be mined for one year, which counts as one year. No matter how long we can hide it, we have made money. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without mining the magic crystal mine, everyone refused to let it go. It will be even more difficult for everyone to let go after mining has paid off handsomely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the fact that the magic crystal mine is occupied and mined becomes a fact, when things go wrong in the future, the central government will still have to be dealt with by the governor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that Hudson's proposal, except for the governor who was slightly injured, everyone present was the beneficiary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the kingdom's laws are strict. Private mining of magic crystal mines is a serious crime, and it is definitely not something that can be fooled by a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spread of the vision is so wide that once the Kingdom makes up its mind to investigate, it will soon be able to target Blood Moon County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more we cover up, the easier it is to attract the kingdom's attention. It's nothing more than a small fight. Once large-scale mining is carried out, things can't be hidden at all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said with a look of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The authority of the central government of the Alpha Kingdom is still there. Even if the authority of Caesar IV is far less than that of the dead Caesar III, it is not easy to shake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, just suppressing the Koslow family has exhausted the Dalton family physically and mentally, and there is really no time to confront the kingdom government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As for the issue of secret mining, then you have to consult Viscount Ottum. They have been able to hide it from us for hundreds of years, which is enough to prove their level of concealment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that this animal horde was purely accidental, it might not be discovered in another hundred years. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he wants to embarrass Viscount Altum, it's that their problem is too big. If the nobles in the whole province are not dragged into the water, once the news of the magic crystal mine reaches the capital, their family will be completely devastated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Lord Earl, for your compliment. We do have some experience in keeping secrets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as a fully enclosed management with no access and no exit is adopted, and local laborers are not recruited, and slaves are used for mining, the news will not spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the problem of the previous vision, it is a big deal to make up an excuse to fool. Or throw out a treasure map to draw the attention of the outside world to the Black Rock Mountain Range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the data we have explored, once this magic crystal mine is fully exploited, it can produce 800,000 to 1 million magic crystals every year, of which high-grade magic crystals will not be less than 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this wealth, everyone can recover in the shortest possible time and get out of the financial crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future era will be the home ground of the Warcraft Cavalry. The slightly better magic potions on the market cannot be bought with gold coins, but with magic crystals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't reserve some in advance, in case you need it in the future, the quota given by the Kingdom of Light won't be enough for everyone…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sincere performances are the easiest to move people's hearts. Viscount Altum's efforts to fool him soon took effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the theory of the importance of the \"magic spar\" came out, the nobles who were already interested strengthened their judgment and became even more unwilling to let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Governor Pierce is in deep entanglement at the moment. The Dalton family also secretly controlled several magic crystal mines, but they were all small mines, and the combined production capacity was less than one-tenth of this magic crystal mine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, it is more than enough for your own use. But once entering the era of Warcraft Cavalry, the demand for magic spar will skyrocket, and it will be difficult to meet the demand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled at everyone and said: \"The biggest problem has been solved, and everyone must have made a psychological decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then let's talk about their respective mining investment and the distribution of magic spar. Take it easy, it's not that serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we are united, even if the news of the future is passed out, it can also be done by a cult organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred years ago, this place was an important stronghold of the Blood Moon Sect. It is very reasonable that they secretly mined the magic crystal mine here. \"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But generally speaking, those who dare to do this are big nobles, and those who hide are small mines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time that a large magic crystal mine has been hidden, and the case involves a middle-class noble family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there should be no obstacles in this kind of case, and the evidence will be found out soon. After all, an ordinary middle-class nobleman has no ability to hinder the investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is very embarrassing. The investigation team sent by the capital is still on the way, and the southeast province is the first to announce the results of the investigation—nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Denying the existence of the magic crystal veins, naturally there is no so-called hidden and private mining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the investigative team sent by the kingdom was unwilling to wait, so the case was closed in such a hurry, it was clear that there was no silver three hundred taels here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A middle-class nobleman involved in the case, and the nobles involved in the entire southeastern province are two completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no conclusive evidence, and even the king has no power. At the same time, an investigation of a provincial noble is launched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, calm down! This matter has not been investigated clearly, and it is not appropriate to rush to a conclusion for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the results of the survey given by the Southeast Province: The last vision was the elemental tide caused by the chaos of the cult skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is: the Skeleton Lord led people to arrange the altar, and wanted to attract the invasion of alien creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to cover the sacrificial activities, including this sudden beast tide, it was also planned by the Skull and Bones Society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the end of the investigation report, the Southeast Province also gave a guess that the Skull and Bones would take refuge in the Kingdom of Hesse, and this operation was to clear the obstacles to their invasion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, tactfully persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how many loopholes there are in the investigation report given by the Southeast Province and how many facts are covered up, it has indeed been closed logically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of beasts has reduced the difficulty of invading the Kingdom of Hesse. As beneficiaries, they have an incentive to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for why the Skull and Bones, which originally followed the Holy See, fell to the Kingdom of Hesse, that is not important at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is possible for a cult organization to do any weird things. Just changing partners is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After expressing his dissatisfaction with a cold drink, Caesar IV said angrily: \"The southeast province rushed to close the case before the investigation team arrived, obviously guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of secretly mining the magic crystal mine is itself led by the Dalton family. Governor Pierce himself is the biggest beneficiary, so naturally he wants to resist the investigation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanation is meaningless. The king often only believes in his own judgment when he has determined things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family has both motivation and strength to plan this matter. This is much more convincing than the fact that the mastermind is a middle-class nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, only the great nobles can handle this kind of thing. Even if it is discovered by the kingdom, it can be easily escaped by paying a certain price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the name of the Earl of Hudson also appeared on the case report of the Southeast Province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if there is no such thing. If there is a case of private mining of magic crystals, I am afraid that the nobles of the entire southeastern province will be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult for a province to accommodate two great nobles. The relationship between the Koslow family and the Dalton family is not good. Unless they participated in it before their rise, there is no need for the Earl of Hudson to come out and endorse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many people involved in the case, it is not appropriate to make things big. It is best to send someone to conduct a secret investigation, and after finding the evidence, deal with it through private communication. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finance Minister Marquis Delgado said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be careless. The Southeast Province is not only the largest taxation province in the Alpha Kingdom, but also a border province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a centralized government, just remove the governor and a group of officials directly, and replace them with a group of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Alpha Kingdom is a joint-stock country. The government can remove officials, but not shareholders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeast province, which contributed the most money and taxes to the kingdom, has always been tough in speaking. If you dare to do such a thing, you have a bottom in your heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the nobles in the southeastern province are colluding, what do you think we can find out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that the members of the investigation team will be detained if they can't reach the place! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter was reported by the royal family's confidant, but it was limited to providing one piece of news, and it was impossible for them to come out and testify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be a traitor. Once the secret is leaked, you will die. Offending the nobles of the entire province, it was only a matter of time before an accident happened, and the king couldn't protect them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no need to worry about this kind of thing. The private mining of magic crystal mines cannot be completed in a day or two. We have plenty of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the nobles in the southeast province are highly vigilant, so we will conduct an investigation after a while, and we will argue with them when we have evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the beast tide has just subsided. The nobles in the southeastern province also urgently need to replenish blood, so it is no big deal to leave the magic crystal mine in their hands for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Increasing their strength will also help consolidate national defense. The continental war is about to break out, and the kingdom should prioritize stability. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ai Fierro axiomically analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meat rotted in the pot and couldn't escape. Even if it is to settle accounts, it will be something after the autumn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the southeast province, Hudson, who is on his way home, is currently enjoying a leisurely tour of the mountains and rivers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the initiative and contributing to orc slave mining, Hudson successfully got a quarter of the share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is not very courageous. All of them gave Hudson a chance for fear of being infected with the \"Curse of Shouyuan\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an insider of the \"curse\", Hudson will naturally keep silent if he has the opportunity to make a fortune silently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time period of evil pollution is too long, and there is no way to verify it in a short period of time. Even if it is said, everyone may not believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedy of Viscount Ottum's family, Hudson can only say sorry to them deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of his relatives, he has no time to be a virgin. After all, it is easy to find problems, but difficult to solve them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The amount of evil energy is not large, but the quality is very high, otherwise a group of experts would not be able to detect it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To purify this thing, in Hudson's view, one must either find a light-type Dharma Saint or find a holy priest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Fa Sheng has long since disappeared from the mainland. The priest at the holy level, Hudson knows only the Pope of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell Viscount Altum, but it didn't make any sense. The pope's cards are bigger than the king's. Even if they go bankrupt, they can't ask Pius VII to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Alpha Kingdom and the Holy See are still hostile forces, so it is even more impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of trying to find a solution, it is better to just move away, rely on time to slowly dilute the evil in the body, and return to normal after a few generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the unexpected benefits of the magic crystal mine, the Warcraft captive sleeping in the car at the moment was Hudson's initial goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a total of 178 monsters, except for eight mid-level monsters, the rest are all low-level monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of the price, the number of female beasts accounted for two-thirds of the captured Warcraft captives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few monsters that were captured by soldiers, most of the monsters were captured by Maxim, and they happened to be transported back to open a harem for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Hudson is worried about now is that Maxim has only come into heat not long ago, and he will not come into heat again for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an easy job to persuade a dragon that is not in estrus to become a dragon. Anyway, looking through the history books, Hudson did not find a successful case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prescribing medicine\", the idea was just born, but Hudson snuffed it out. Once this kind of tasteless thing is done, Maxim will hate him for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is necessary to take medicine, he must be willing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this kind of thing is not in a hurry. No matter how you say it, you have to wait for the Warcraft base to evacuate completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who left in front were all foreign powers, and all the big powers in the country still safely kept the pregnant female beasts to adopt fetuses in the mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have something on my mind, and I am not even interested in taking a tour of the mountains and rivers. Nominally Hudson is playing, but in fact Bear Stearns is tossing alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chasing hares for a while, digging out bird nests for a while, and tossing insects for a while. Just like a mischievous villain, he made the birds and beasts feel uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, Maxim is much more mature and stable. Lying on the ground with his eyes closed, he fell asleep under the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion. In recent days, Hudson has always felt that Maxim has become more and more lethargic. Whenever I get the chance, I go to sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he doesn't sleep for a long time every time. If he sleeps for decades, he, the dragon knight, will be in tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, there is an unlucky dragon among the four dragon knights in the mainland, and he has been sleeping for more than ten years now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragon is not very good-tempered. If it disturbs their sleep, they will beat up even the dragon knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a matter of life and death, generally no one will forcibly wake up the sleeping dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson discovered that the dragon's deep sleep seemed to be related to the increase in strength. It seems to be sleeping, but it is actually digesting the growing strength in the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following him for the past few years, Maxim's strength has grown much faster. In just a few years, it has gone the way of hundreds of years under normal circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rapid increase in strength naturally takes time to digest. If he didn't sleep for decades, that would be considered a face for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is also possible that Maxim was worried that the days of this kind of rapid growth would be limited, so he forcibly controlled his dormant thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, compared with dragons, the lifespan of humans is too short. In case Hudson is gone when he wakes up, it will be difficult to grow his strength quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dragon will also weigh whether it is good for a while or good for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lighted a bonfire, strung a processed hare, and Hudson prepared lunch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for his own dragon and bear, in this case, he naturally tried to help solve it. He didn't have the time to cook for two big eaters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the capital sent an urgent message. Last night, the Human Race Alliance Council made a resolution to declare war on the Alien Race Alliance. At this moment, the mainland war has broken out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what the soldiers said, Hudson's face changed drastically, and even the hare in his hand fell into the bonfire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The international situation is tense, and he has also heard about it. However, the continent of Yaslant was always at war, and there were far more tense days than peaceful days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, local conflicts usually break out first, and then regional wars are triggered, and then the wars escalate step by step, gradually evolving into continental wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's analysis, the continental war will break out in five years. It never occurred to him that the rehearsal had just begun, and it would directly enter the climax stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the rise of the Koslow family is too short, and has not yet been recognized by the mainland aristocratic circle. The application of the members of the Human Race Alliance was rejected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to understand what happened behind this, you can only wait through the kingdom. The news has passed through one hand, not to mention the accuracy problem, the light efficiency has been delayed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The terrible news of declaring war on the alien alliance, under normal circumstances, should be sent back with the magic communication circle as soon as the decision is made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else, a group of veteran nobles received the news last night, and Hudson was half a day later than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this little time is nothing, but if it comes to a critical moment, half a day's work can determine the life and death of a party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being ruthless, Hudson decided to build a magic circle of communication when he went back, and he couldn't continue to transfer people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something important happens and the Dalton family deliberately delays it, he will receive the news even later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the position of the member of the Terran Alliance, it still needs a long-term effort. It is not enough to just get the support of the nobles in the kingdom, it is also necessary to get the support of nobles from all over the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to Tom to step up his guard and ensure the safety of the team. If you encounter trouble on the road, you can first ask the nobles along the way for help.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Hudson extinguished the fire with a water polo technique. Regardless of the delay, he immediately aroused Maxim, soared into the dragon, and galloped towards the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continental war broke out, affecting all aspects. Not only the Alpha Kingdom needs to make strategic adjustments, but a series of policies of the Mountain Territory must also be changed accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, escorting the Warcraft captives back can only be regarded as a small problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the **** of two regiments, accidents are basically impossible in the southeastern province. Even if you run into trouble, there are nobles along the way who can help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of Hudson is still very useful in the middle and lower aristocratic circles. As long as it does not harm their own interests, everyone will not mind selling favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is not communicating now, no one can guarantee that there will be no communication in the future. Not to mention anything else, once a war breaks out, the position of commander in chief of the kingdom will most likely belong to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, it will be completely different if there is friendship and no friendship. With a little care, the probability of surviving the battlefield and making meritorious deeds will greatly increase.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They regard each other as heretics and wish to put each other to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the pressure of the human race, they would have broken out a civil war long ago. After all, who can tolerate heresy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elves, prairie elves, and night elves have three major races, but because of their different ideas, they established their own countries independently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the atmosphere in the hall is completely different from what everyone imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three great elf kings who haven't seen each other for a long time, like good sisters, go on with the daily routine together. There is no grievance that they have to join forces due to the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sister, the situation is not good! The ambition of the human race is greater than we expected, and the frequency of launching continental wars is getting higher and higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the history of continental wars in the last 10,000 years, apart from those stupid and dirty orcs, the human race provoked the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most domineering thing is the introduction of the \"Five Times Advantage Act\", which simply beats whoever is stronger, without any reason at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, in order to avoid the oppression of the human race, we had to accept the advice of the sages and split because of disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you can hide for a while, but you can't hide forever. According to the expansion speed of the human race's strength, I am afraid that it will not be long before they will still be eyeing us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night elf queen said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves have been inherited from ancient times, and they have experienced countless winds and rains all the way to the present, but they have never been so urgent as they are now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when the most domineering orcs ruled the mainland, the elves could say no to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transition to the era of the human race, the situation has changed. The human race is not that overbearing, but the human race can play politics!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire at its peak seemed powerful, but the elves had to face only one of the royal families, and there was no need to be cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is not that aggressive. They haven't sent troops to invade the elves in the past few hundred years, but the threat to them is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the various races in the mainland continue to decline under the suppression of the human race, it is impossible not to panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, third sister. Back then, the sages had predicted that when the human race completely overwhelmed all the races in the mainland, it was also the beginning of their civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My elves are in a safe place, and the geographical location is the best cover. As long as a superpower is not allowed to appear among the human race in the Northern Continent, it will not be able to threaten us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is the most selfish, and the human race kingdoms in the south and central regions will not spend their expeditions for no reason. What good is it to the northern countries to help them attack us?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, we are not easy to bully. We have been showing weakness to the enemy all these years, but it does not mean that we are really weak!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really put our lives together, we can definitely bring several big human nations to the end. Are they willing to die with us? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elf queen said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the elves have been passed down from ancient times to the present is not based on \"peace-loving\", but on terrifying strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With excellent cultivation talent and a long enough lifespan, what the elves need most is a master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rare magisters and great magisters are rarely seen in the outside world. Even if they are not everywhere in the elves, they are really not lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost every elf village has a magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't take much effort, as long as you live long enough, you can become a master by grinding kung fu with water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that the fertility is too low. The current strength is based on long-term accumulation. Once the vitality is exhausted in the war, it may not be able to recover for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the elves, many times even if they win on the battlefield, they fail strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world only saw the elves paddling in the previous continental wars, and mistakenly thought that they had lost their fighting spirit. Little did they know that this was a race with low fertility and had to make a choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the elves, participating in the continental war is very simple. It is not difficult to sweep the entire northern continent, but the difficulty is after the battle is over!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, if the elves can join forces with all the races on the mainland at any cost, they have every chance of pulling the human race down from their position of supremacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after pulling down the human race, they can only watch other races grow bigger, but they can't get any benefits for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few million people in total, and it doesn't make any sense to give them more land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hundred and eighty years later, other races have made further progress in recovery, leaving them still licking their wounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before they could recover, the new mainland overlord came again. Continue to join hands with all ethnic groups in the mainland, and then bring down the overlord of the mainland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can win every war, they will become weaker and weaker. After tossing and tossing for a short time, he tossed and wiped out his family fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't afford to fight a war of attrition, you can only rely on force to deter. Judging from the current situation, the strategy of the elves is still successful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many human countries that have had conflicts with the elves, and those who dared to send troops to invade the elves have disappeared in the past few hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last one did this, the bones turned into mud, and stayed in the elf forest to nourish all things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current elves are like a rich second generation who has limited ability and inherited a lot of wealth. As long as you don't go out and toss, you can live comfortably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elder sister means that we should follow the original plan and send troops symbolically, just to hold back part of the human race's troops?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is too cowardly. If the human race wins again, the Alien Alliance may be overwhelmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it's better to take this opportunity to wipe out those human nations that condone slave traders, expand the elf forest to hundreds of kilometers, and increase our strategic buffer! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Queen of the Grassland Elf suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest harm the human race can do to the elves is slave hunting. Almost every year, there are disobedient elves who are brutally murdered by slave traders because they are curious about the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of this problem, the elves have often had disputes with human countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the several human nations next to the elves, it was purely because of their bad luck. Indulging the slave hunting team is purely a crime of wanting to impose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Living under the eyes of the elves, the local nobles dare not even raise elf slaves, let alone capture slaves themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can't afford to provoke the elves, and they can't afford to provoke the slave catchers from all over the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, these notorious slave traders are a group of low-level mercenaries, but in fact, there are no weak people who can freely enter and exit the Elven Forest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the system of the Aslante Continent, apart from the vests of the major forces, how can there be so many masters among the people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves asked them to fight the slave trade; the human world also had a need for elf slaves, and they were required to provide convenience for slave trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a small human country caught in the middle, it is purely a dilemma.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing they can do is to guarantee to the elves that they will fight the slave trade;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actions against the slave trade have never stopped. It's just that the ones who are attacked are all wild slave traders, and those with background and background are not touched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on both sides, they managed to survive, but they also disgusted the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't touch the bottom line. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, the elves didn't do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that was a period of peace, and now that it has entered a period of continental war, the situation has become different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Human Race Alliance and the Alien Race Alliance have already started a war. As one of the Alien Race Alliance, the Elf Race has nothing wrong with attacking them at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wait a minute, the continental war has just begun, and the human race still has some power in the northern continent, so we don't need to be the first bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimating those warlike orcs, they can't sit still anymore. The human race has just occupied the orc prairie, and the local foundation is not stable. The seven prairie kingdoms should not be able to stop the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they destroy the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, and the army reaches the gate of King Alpha, we will make an example of others, and the price we need to pay will be much smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arranging people to send a batch of magic equipment to all ethnic groups in the mainland is our support for them. By the way, I'm picking some destructive secrets and sending them over, I guess our allies can use them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs will take the initiative to attack, so send more magic-breaking scrolls. In case they were blocked by the human city again, they were delayed on the road. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest elf queen said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To hang out on the continent of Aslante, you need not only strength, but also brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of allies can be borrowed, and it is not in vain. What's more, in the name of supporting allies, you can sell a wave of favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves who paddled water in all previous continental wars have not been expelled from the alien alliance. The most important thing is that they have made substantial contributions to the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not participating in the war, it means that the tribe loves peace and has no desire to fight. When it comes to supporting their allies, they never hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aid of various magic equipment and potions has never stopped. In order to support the various races on the mainland, the elves even set up teleportation magic circles leading to the various races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the huge cost of this magic circle, too many restrictions, and the limited transmission ability, the alien alliance would not have been in a passive state all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire, the five great beast emperors who escaped in the last war, gathered together again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A friend in need is a friend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at being beaten together, everyone still helped the Beamons in times of crisis, and did not let the five royal families become the four royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After losing the fertile prairie, the power of the orc empire was severely weakened. Even though all the vassal races were weakened during the war, the position of the five royal families is still unstable at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crisis is not only sourced from the outside, but also from the inside. The defeat exposed many hidden problems within the imperial court, and pointed the finger at the five emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was in the past, thunderous means could be used to suppress it. But this time it's different, if we continue to kill each other, no one will be available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a matter of losing soldiers or generals, but that the population of all ethnic groups has dropped sharply, and the potential for war has been greatly weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just relying on the barren land now is simply not enough to support their recovery. After more than two years of recuperation, some viable vassal races have already experienced a contradiction between population growth and insufficient resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Those idiots thought that if they didn't send troops, the human race would let them go. They didn't expect that only two years later, the continental war broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they act earlier and join forces with us, they will definitely be able to pull the human race from the position of the overlord of the mainland!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the situation is breaking down, you think of us, why did you go early? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he was very dissatisfied with the performance of the alien alliance in the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They keep saying that they want to support them, but when it comes to specific actions, they all use various excuses to shirk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from calling for a few mediations, it did not provide much substantive help to the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Emperor Xiong calm down, now is not the time to be angry. No matter how much the Alien Alliance has done before, we can't just sit back and watch them lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without them holding back the main force of the human race, relying on our own strength alone, we will never be able to take back the orc prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, this war may already be the alliance's last chance. If they lose to the race again, their dominance of the mainland will really be unshakable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, we now have no choice. To stay in this corner is to wait for death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie have gained a firm foothold, it will be difficult to drive them out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex persuasively said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the target of being targeted by the human race, the life of the Beamon clan is really miserable now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the four clans give them a hand, it will not change the nature of the orc empire. As the weakest royal family, they were naturally assigned to the most barren territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the small number of people in the tribe, they can barely support themselves, but it is somewhat difficult to support the vassal races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, the contradiction can be forcibly suppressed. But with the passage of time, the conflict of insufficient resources will break out sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to get caught in internal fighting, you can only fight out. As long as the orc prairie is taken back, there will be no such troubles for at least ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Emperor Bimon is right, we really can't just sit and wait for death. If we let the race grow bigger, sooner or later we will usher in the disaster of genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I understand it, they just want to dominate the continent, and they are not prepared to leave room for all kinds of living.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment when there is no way to retreat, I don't believe that the elves can still watch the fun from the sidelines. With their participation, at least the human race can be driven out of the North Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity for revenge has come, so don't miss it. Taking advantage of the unstable foundation of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, let's destroy them first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the follow-up is to accept as soon as it is good, or go all the way south to destroy the Alpha Kingdom, can be decided according to the development of the situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Emperor said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he really lacks confidence. He still has confidence in winning the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, but he only has one thought about destroying the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the current strength of the Orc Empire is insufficient, and they are not strong enough to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he showed his chariot and horses and pulled them out for a field battle, he still had the confidence to defeat the Alpha Kingdom, but that was only a defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To smash the tortoise shell of that road and destroy the Alpha Kingdom in one fell swoop, the Lion Emperor dare not even think about it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force was severely damaged, and the cannon fodder troops were also not enough. No matter how the cannon fodder race can be born, it will take time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you both want to fight, then I will accompany you to the end. Take back the prairie first, and then go to the Alpha people to settle the score!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Silver Moon Wolf Emperor gritted his teeth and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prairie is the most suitable place for wolves to live. When they arrived in this poor country, they were about to eat grass instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While all ethnic groups in the mainland were preparing for war, the mountain leaders also started a meeting to decide the future destiny of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-level leaders of the territory who were able to rush back and the core members of the Koslow family all gathered together at this moment to discuss the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The younger generation is eager to try, wanting to gain greater military exploits in the ensuing chaos; the older ones are completely different, all of them are frowning and worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at everyone's expressions, Hudson said directly: \"The main reason for calling everyone to this meeting today is to tell you that the years of peace are coming to an end, and we must prepare for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continental war is inevitable. When it will affect the Alpha Kingdom and when it will affect my mountain territory, everything is unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for you to worry about the kingdom. If you can avoid participating in the war, you will definitely find a way to avoid it; if you can participate in this war late, you will definitely not participate in it early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what we have to do is: while preparing for the battle, we must also seize the time to develop the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all the reserve training will be resumed from now on. The original plan to gradually reduce land reclamation and shift to the development of a light industrial economy has now been cancelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With food in hand, don't panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need to do now is to open up more wasteland and store more grain. Set a goal first, increase the grain reserves of the territory to 500,000 tons within one year, and increase the grain reserves to 800,000 tons within two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs first organized manpower and repaired the warehouse for me. I would rather wait for the food in an empty warehouse than have no place to store the food when it arrives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just relying on the production of the territory will definitely not be able to complete the goal. But it doesn't matter, the southeast province is a big province of grain production, we can still go out to buy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames of war won't burn out for a while, this is the best opportunity. The Ministry of Commerce will implement it for me when it goes down. Before the news spreads and the price of grain has not risen, it has opened up the purchase for me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to agricultural development, the speed of fishery development must also be accelerated. Notify the shipyard and let them prioritize the production of fishing boats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to daily needs, the fishery department must contribute 8,000 tons of dried fish to me this year, and this number will be doubled next year, as the military food reserve for the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the battlefield, these dried fish are the best food. The Ministry of Government Affairs will step up implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are monsters in the sea, please send someone to notify them immediately, and I will ask Maxim to help you solve the trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these tasks, there is another priority, which is to hurry up and have a baby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the younger generation in the family, as long as they are of age, they will be arranged first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the battlefield is changing, and no one knows what will happen in the future. It's better to leave a bloodline inheritance in advance than to end up...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change of words made a group of young family members very confused. The previous content was very normal, why did it suddenly become a large-scale marriage urging and birthing scene?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reasons given by Hudson are too good to allow them to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you have an idea in your heart, you want to wait for success and fame to pursue a good marriage, but now you can only dispel this idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrogance, it also depends on the target. When they met Hudson, who was in his twenties and had already made a name for himself, they really couldn't hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the depressed younger generation of the family, Hudson smiled slightly. To be honest, that's right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how the external situation develops, there is nothing wrong with having more children. He is still very relieved about the reproductive talent of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other families, this is the biggest advantage. As long as we seize the time to have more children now, our own population advantage will become more and more obvious after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in any world, everyone pays attention to the effect of superiors and inferiors. As long as the nobles above are willing to take the lead in giving birth, the serfs below will definitely be willing to follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the cost of raising children is borne by the lord, and they don't need to worry about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As the most powerful country in the Northern Continent, the Alpha Kingdom has not only glory, but also responsibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once foreign races invade on a large scale, the kingdom will inevitably send troops to rescue all countries. Of course, the specific rescue efforts depend on moral integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, are we going to war again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but since giving birth to her eldest son, her political sense has become dull.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reached out and patted the ashes on little Franz, Hudson nodded slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The continental war has broken out, and there will be no more pure land in the entire Aslant continent, and no one can be alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time the human race has a huge advantage, and the probability of winning is as high as 90%, so there is no need to worry too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe after this war, aliens will no longer be a threat. Use a war to stabilize the dominance of our human race, no matter how much you pay, it's worth it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principle is correct, but when the price needs to be borne by oneself, it is another picture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all fighting for the survival of the race. Standing on their respective positions, everyone is on the side of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then be careful, don't try to be brave on the battlefield, Franz is still waiting for you to come back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, tears appeared in the corners of Melissa's eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more you know the awe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of ordinary people, a dragon knight like Hudson is free to do anything on the battlefield. He is the only one who kills people, and no one can do anything to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa, who is familiar with history books, knows very well how **** the battles of various clans were during the Continental War, and there were not a few dragon knights who fell on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heroes emerge in troubled times, but more people have become the stepping stones of heroes. Once the success is complete, the vast majority of people are on the way to becoming heroes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reaching out to help Melissa wipe away her tears, Hudson said with a smile: \"You can rest assured. The war will last for a while, and the kingdom will not be burned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they join the war now, they will only send troops symbolically. Unless the situation on the front line deteriorates, it won't be my turn to play. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it. As a banner of the Alpha Kingdom's military, Hudson will not go to the front line unless it is absolutely necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, other people lead troops out to reinforce, and if they lose, they lose. The impact on the kingdom is not very great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is defeated, even if it is only a small defeat, it will cause an uproar and affect the morale of the kingdom's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the important ministers from all over the kingdom, Caesar IV said a little tiredly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The continental war has already broken out. We don't need to worry about the situation in the southern and central continents. The war was initiated by them, so we should have made comprehensive preparations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is the North Continent!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien race is the most powerful in the northern continent. None of the elves, orcs, and ancient survivors are easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of our human race is the weakest here. Every time the continental war broke out, the kingdom has undertaken the main task of fighting against alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is slightly better. There are seven steppe kingdoms separating us from the orc empire, adding a strategic barrier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what the specific situation is, everyone knows it in their hearts. The strength of the Seven Kingdoms in the Grassland alone can't stop the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the other two lines is not optimistic. The elves and the ancient survivors also provoked the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received requests for help from eleven countries. Judging from the content, everything is urgent. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the attendants had already distributed the appeal letter to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long while, the faces of the nobles who had a general understanding of the situation all collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the Alpha Kingdom is obliged to send troops to rescue allies. However, so many distress letters arrived almost at the same time, there was no way they could be rescued!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, from a military point of view, the kingdom does not have the ability to rescue all countries at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it's better to transfer these appeal letters to the Parliament of the Ethnic Alliance and seek help from all countries in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as a responsible nation, we cannot do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Warhammer is in endless civil war, and now the situation is critical, and it is just time to persuade them to cease fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether they are re-merging or becoming independent into two countries, as long as they stop their internal fighting, it will have very important positive significance for the North Continent battlefield. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the first sentence, which is the truth, the rest are all excuses, without any nutritional value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, everyone's eyes are focused on him, forcing him to open his eyes and talk nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Use soldiers like gods, just use them to fool others. If you follow suit, you will be done for!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson is also making a big gamble. With the safety of the Northern Continent as a bargaining chip, the elves will not invade with all their might.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as this paddling champion is still just paddling, the Alpha Kingdom will be able to survive this catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for mediating the Warhammer Kingdom's civil war, that's pure nonsense. Except for a few battles at the very beginning, most of the time people were just \"quarreling and fighting\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person. Knowing that the situation in the mainland is tense, but still fighting desperately, isn't it boring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The struggle between nobles is essentially the art of struggle and compromise. If there were no external interference, the Warhammer Kingdom would have been unified long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Noisy, that is because someone gave them the confidence to make them think that they have the ability to overwhelm each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the mainland war broke out, and the ancient survivors formed a group to invade the Warhammer Kingdom. They couldn't stop if they didn't want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is a race war of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's life or death, there is no third choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no problem in mediating the civil war in the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the Continental War, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in contact with the two major factions within the Warhammer Kingdom, and both sides have a lot of sincerity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, judging from the current situation, even if the Warhammer Kingdom stopped the civil war, it would be difficult to stop the soldiers of the ancient survivors, let alone support neighboring countries to resist the invasion of the elves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was definitely the most active department in the Alpha Kingdom after the outbreak of the Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coordinate the two major factions of the Warhammer Kingdom to join forces to fight against the enemy. Naturally, they will be present in this kind of prestige building.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The understanding of the situation is also the deepest. It is very clear that the current Warhammer Kingdom is no longer useful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then find a way to stabilize the elves first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from other races in the mainland, the elves have a slow reproductive ability and do not have the strength to compete for hegemony on the mainland. They are not a big threat to our human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, the conflict between the human race and the elves is nothing more than someone capturing elf slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big deal, we made a promise to ban elf slave trade in the kingdom, and made a proposal in the Human Race Alliance Parliament to make capturing and trading elves a felony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation, the probability of the Alliance Council agreeing is very high. As a matter of sincerity, the kingdom first released the elf slaves in its hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to slaves who have just been captured and have not been insulted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those elven slaves who have been insulted must be dealt with immediately, and no hidden dangers can be left at this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his opinion, exchanging the ban on slave hunting for the neutrality of the elves is too cost-effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it doesn't work, as long as it can delay the speed of the elves' dispatch of troops, it will also have very important strategic significance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you think things too simply. Those who have elf slaves are all great nobles from all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Human Race Alliance Congress passed laws, it would be difficult to restrain them. Our proposal at a time like this has no substantive meaning other than offending people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Torsten taunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a fact. The Human Race Alliance Parliament's binding force on all countries is strong, and it is pitifully weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can play a role depends on whether it is in everyone's interest. Only when the interests of the group are safeguarded, the laws of the alliance are truly binding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Torsten, it doesn't matter whether it is binding or not, at least our decision can be implemented within the kingdom and can play a role in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't put the kingdom's safety at risk just because you don't want to part with a few elf slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of these promises, whether the elves can be neutralized, at least the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can use this excuse to first pull the elves to the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An extra day of talking gives us an extra day of preparation. It would be even better if it could be delayed for a few years until the situation in the mainland becomes clear. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, he still has a lot to say. This continental war is different from the past, and the participation enthusiasm of the elves must be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to stabilize the elves, the price you need to pay will definitely be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have precedents in history. The outside world only saw the elves as paddling champions, but didn't notice that they all got benefits in the previous continental wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to keep the elves neutral, not only the Alpha Kingdom has promised him benefits, but all countries in the mainland have made similar promises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly, the elves have even signed secret agreements with many human countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not waste paper. With the blessing of magic power, many secret agreements are mandatory for the signers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the countries of the human race, we know that every time a major international conflict occurs, the measures taken by the elves are mediation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Orc Empire, which is also in the Northern Continent, where dungeons are often organized by groups, the elves are really much happier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these contracts are not without hidden dangers. Once the person in power changes, the original secret agreement will lose its binding force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter how binding a contract is, it can only restrain the signer of the contract, and it is impossible to expand the scope without limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson is right, as long as the pace of elves sending troops is delayed, any opportunity should be tried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just a few elf slaves? Compared with the interests of the human race, I believe that most nobles with conscience will make the right choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone present, please express your opinion first, can you give up the elf slave in your hand? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland asked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old prime minister, who had been silent for many years, once again showed his decisive side, as if bringing everyone back to the era of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to refuse, and all the words have been said, if anyone continues to object, it is an unscrupulous nobleman who has no regard for the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wearing such a hat, you don't have to mix in the noble circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how upset they were, everyone could only force their smiles, pretending to be happy and agreeing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the big strategy was decided, Hudson instantly became a little transparent, and the audience was silent on how to support countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to do the limelight once, and there is no need to finish it alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These nobles present are all the elites of the Alpha Kingdom, and all of them have experienced wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't have the talent to lead soldiers, at least you know how to lead soldiers. When supporting allies, one is more stable than the other, without the slightest aggressiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, everyone unanimously decided to send a legion of reinforcements to each of the eleven countries. As for when to send troops and how to form the troops, it is natural to discuss slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Alpha Kingdom promised to send troops, and it must fulfill its ally obligations with practical actions. As for the efficiency of implementation, it only needs to catch up with the average speed of the mainland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is an expedition to 11 countries, and it must be fully prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At almost the same time, the Principality of Moxi was also holding a similar military meeting. The only difference was that George had seven fewer letters of appeal for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was due to distance considerations, or maybe it was because the Principality of Moxi would also be caught in the flames of war in the near future. In short, the Seven Prairie Kingdoms did not ask them for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The absence of seven letters of appeal for help does not mean that the Principality of Moxi will be relaxed. Because of geopolitics, the pressure they need to bear is even greater than that of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Warhammer Kingdom collapses, the flames of war will immediately spread to the Moxi Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the coalition army of the ancient survivors or the army of the elves, as long as they are killed, they will not be able to hide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ally is the Alpha Kingdom behind him. As for the other countries in the Northern Continent, they were directly ignored by George.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the days of peace have passed for a long time. The biggest crisis usually faced is the infighting among nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's called war in name, but in fact, this kind of frontal Pk that shows off chariots and horses is a low-level \"fight\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a real war, how can thousands of people fight down and single-digit casualties?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Used to fight fake wars every day, these countries have long forgotten how real wars unfold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the few small countries that were hammered by orcs in the past few years have learned some lessons and paid a little attention to armaments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this effort is not enough in a real race war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Warhammer Kingdom lost many cities in the border area at the beginning of the war, and the current situation is probably not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Principality of Kantruo, the Principality of Ustad, and the Principality of Fick is even worse. The elves have already panicked without doing anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the army of elves invades, they will probably fall within half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already communicated with several major powers in the mainland. Except for the Alpha Kingdom, which clearly stated that it would provide assistance, the rest of the countries have refused on the grounds that they are also fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid it's…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Earl Renato finished speaking, the Minister of Military Affairs on the side added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Renato, you are too optimistic. If the elves really send troops, let alone they can't last for half a year, even if we can't last for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the situation of the Duchy of Kantruo, Duchy of Ustad, and Duchy of Fick, they were able to hold back the elf army for a month, which is regarded as an outstanding contribution to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the elves and the ancient survivors join forces, it will be a matter of time before the Warhammer Kingdom falls. Optimistically, it is estimated that they can last for half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not because of how capable they are, but because it takes a lot of time to occupy their vast territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins' words deeply hurt everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At other times, this must be a model of low EQ. But at this time, it is the most rational answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he must always remain rational in times of crisis for the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any unrealistic optimism will lead the Principality of Moxi to a point of no return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, what do you think of the current situation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George asked calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the orcs besieged the city and the principality was at stake, he persisted through the years, how could he be intimidated by things that didn't happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A true warrior who dares to face the bleak reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, George was very ordinary in the era of the crown prince, but since he took the throne, the Principality of Moxi has always been in troubled times. The more things I experienced, the more I grew up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is in crisis, but when will the situation in the Principality of Moxi not be in crisis?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After cleaning up the mess of the orcs, the debt crisis followed; after the debt crisis was resolved, several kingdoms in the middle were ready to move again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outbreak of the Continental War made the above crises not a problem, and the threat of the elves and the ancient survivors came again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Born in sorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being in crisis every day, George got used to it after a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let's wait for the Alpha Kingdom's decision now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ding Buwang, even if the elves really invaded, they probably wouldn't come out in full force, at most they would send out some clansmen whose lifespan was nearing the end of their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom is willing to join forces with us, it should be able to prevent them from joining forces with the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble now is that the orcs are also moving. Once the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland are defeated, a large part of the energy of the Alpha Kingdom will be restrained by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said anxiously.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But the measures being taken now are - only training but not mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the old rules, use the region as a unit to form large and small legions nearby to prepare for the next big battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each county has a legion, small counties form small legions, and large counties form large legions. The original system of ten thousand legions was completely disrupted this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the smallest remote county, a legion has only four to five thousand people; in the largest king's capital legion, it has an establishment of more than 40,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County, where Hudson is located, is considered a large county in the southeastern province. According to the plan, it needs to provide a large army of 20,000 people, of which the mountain leader will contribute half, and the other half will be his own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either another branch of the Koslow family, or a younger brother who mixed with Hudson. The entire Wright County, plus half of Wyton County, now belong to Hudson's sphere of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not all, the branches of the Koslow family scattered all over the country are also a big force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you add them all up, it will not be difficult to pull out a team of 20,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, those who went to the battlefield with Master Hudson, and those who came back alive in the end, all earned money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the upstarts who went to the north to develop, the family branches that stayed in place have also made considerable progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the normal expansion, there are also many lucky people who have inherited inheritance from their in-laws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Who would let you go to the battlefield with Master Hudson? Not only is it easier to gain military exploits, but the survival rate is also higher than that of other commanders?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only by surviving can we be qualified to talk about development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important factor for Hudson to successfully become the head of the family and suppress the gang of elders in the major branches is that he brought substantial benefits to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are like some prodigal sons and take your family to the front line, your entire army will be wiped out. Not to mention becoming the head of the family, it is good for relatives not to become enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the cost, the current training must be in various places, but when the war breaks out in the future, it is still necessary to find a way to gather people together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the ease of coordination last time, it must be much more difficult to coordinate this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that there are branches of the Koslow family under their command, everyone will not let them go easily. It's not to make things difficult on purpose, but to fight for a guarantee for myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, during his tenure as the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson couldn't let \"his own people\" follow him to die for those missions that would lead to death?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has such small thoughts, but Hudson didn't take it to heart. If you can't coordinate now, it doesn't mean you won't be able to coordinate in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, putting a few branches under their command can make all the great nobles feel at ease, which is actually worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Hudson would not deliberately arrange for any army to die, these people also dare not let the Koslow family be used as cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Restricting each other can often make cooperation smoother. After all, the kingdom's army itself is the main force in this war, and the ministries must cooperate closely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the general plan was finalized, Hudson's residence became lively. There is an endless stream of nobles who come to visit every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily entertainment makes people collapse. If the Ministry of Military Affairs did not strongly persuade him to participate in the formulation of emergency plans, he would have run away long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland is visiting!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was seeing off a guest, he received news that the prime minister was visiting late at night, and Hudson was also speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson got up and went out to meet him in person. This is the meeting of the old prime minister, and it must be given enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some politeness, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland got straight to the point and said: \"Earl Hudson, there is no one else here, so don't have any worries, just speak up if you have any ideas!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have already read the plan you put forward in the Ministry of Military Affairs. The situation in the North Continent hasn't collapsed to that point yet, has it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is not very optimistic about the upcoming war. Unexpectedly, the plan given by Hudson was even more pessimistic than they expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the strategy of the orcs, it is quite normal. But the strategy against the elves and the ancient survivors is terribly negative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in Hudson's view, going deep behind enemy lines to wreak havoc is an active attack, but in the eyes of the nobles, this is passive avoidance of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the history of the continent of Aslant, there has never been a precedent for guerrilla warfare. Only the remnants of the defeated and destroyed forces will lurk in search of opportunities to sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, this war is different from the past. There are indications that the countries in the southern and central parts of the mainland want to completely wipe out the alien races within their respective spheres of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elves can watch the alien alliance lose, but it doesn't mean they will sit back and watch the alien alliance fall. At a critical moment, they are likely to choose to pull the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency knows how strong the elves are. As long as they change their strategy, it will be difficult for the North Continent to stop their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are ancient survivors and orcs in the North Continent. Once the three major alien races join forces, there is no chance of winning against us head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only hope is to exchange space for time, extend the enemy's front as much as possible, increase the difficulty of their logistics supplies, and drag down the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thundering measures were taken against the orcs because they were injured in the last war. Not only did the five royal families suffer heavy losses, but those vassal races also suffered even greater losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not enough cannon fodder, and the crowd tactics that the orcs liked most in the past can no longer be used. The five royal families dare not take their few members to fight with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It only takes a few battles to make them realize this, and they will fall into a strategic stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves and the ancient survivors have strong individual forces, but after all, they have been away from the mainland battlefield for a long time. Both their tactical thinking and the commanding ability of the officers are seriously lagging behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    10 points of military strength, in their hands, they can play at most five or six points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the number of their clansmen is limited, and they can only mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops. Even if the North Continent is thrown out, they will not be able to control such a large territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many noble castles along the way, you need to pull out one by one. With the little troops in their hands, they couldn't finish it in a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really do that, we have nothing to do. It is estimated that before they finish pulling out the nails on the road, the Continental War will end first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they want to support the alien alliance, their only choice is to abandon the aristocratic castles in the countryside, only control the main cities along the way, and forcefully open a passage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is our chance to fight back. It is only necessary to send out a small group of troops, unite the remaining nobles from various countries, and rely on the country castles to attack their logistics lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If conditions permit, those experienced slave catchers can also be sent to go deep into the elf forest to wreak havoc in order to contain their forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is an option in extreme cases. The elves are not easy to mess with. If they are really provoked, the kingdom will not be able to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't borrow a route from the kingdom and choose to cross into the central continent from those countries in the west, then there is no need to take these extraordinary measures. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One will succeed and ten thousand bones will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the general of the Alpha Kingdom, his first consideration is the interests of the kingdom, and the second is the mainland battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being silent for a while, the prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, slowly nodded and said, \"You are right, the orcs are the biggest threat to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are at least 100 million humans distributed in the northern continent. With the strength of the light elves and ancient survivors, even if they were allowed to kill them, how much could they kill?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, now that my human race is the overlord of the mainland, they still have to worry about being settled by the autumn queen, and they will definitely take care of it when they start their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, not all alien races are as reckless as orcs, without considering the consequences. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland chose to support Hudson's plan. On the surface, it seems a little cowardly, and even suspected of betraying allies, but it is indeed feasible strategically!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you act according to the plan, the countries along the way can completely abandon the cities that are destined to be untenable, and evacuate people to the countryside to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the impact on the continental war of letting the elf army go, I can only say I'm sorry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the major powers in the south-central region are willing to divide their troops to support, no matter how difficult the battlefield is, Hudson will not come up with such an idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these countries have regarded the countries of the Northern Continent as abandoned children from the very beginning. In order to survive, then don't blame everyone for messing up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can't be considered a complete failure. According to Hudson's plan, the Alpha Kingdom will still intercept the orc army and contribute to the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    National countries in the northern continent will also attack the logistics supply lines of the elves and the ancient survivors. The specific effect is unknown for the time being, but at least it proves that everyone is still insisting on resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the central and southern countries are strong enough, they can also play a game of beating dogs behind closed doors, and bury the elves and ancient survivors on the battlefield together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, things are not that simple. Whether the countries in the Northern Continent can understand our intentions is still unknown. Even if they see it, they may not be willing to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to survive from the ancient times, the elves and the ancient survivors are not fools. Even if we can't see it in the early stage, we can see through our plan in the later stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two strategies in front of them: either follow the route we set, go all the way south to reinforce the alien alliance; or unite with the orcs to destroy the kingdom first, occupy the northern continent in one fell swoop, and form a new pattern of confrontation between the north and the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is still under great pressure. Once the worst happens, we can only concentrate our superior forces first and beat the orcs desperately to have a chance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be bitter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more pressure you will be under. Originally, he was responsible for it alone, but now that the Grand Duke of Newfoundland has sent it to his door, it just happened to bring one more unlucky guy into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, all the high-level officials in the kingdom will fall into this kind of \"anxiety\" in the next few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no option to surrender. The more anxious everyone is, the more they can rely on Hudson in the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naked conspiracy, Hudson is not afraid of being known at all. After all, he is the only general in the entire Alpha Kingdom who can command millions of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Excellency, the kingdom will do its best to avoid the worst possible situation. However, you must still prepare for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation gets out of hand, the orc empire will rely on you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It could be seen that he was quite frightened. Originally, he just felt the pressure, but he didn't expect that the Alpha Kingdom was on the verge of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows what those elves think, but in the context of the end of the alien alliance, in order for the race to survive, it is indeed possible for the three major alien forces to abandon their conflicts and jointly occupy the North Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, the only choice is to deal with the orcs first. Prior to this, the only thing Alpha Kingdom could do was \"direct disaster to the south\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Kingdom of Alpha and the three major kingdoms of the Central Continent are also rivals. Taking the opportunity to trick them, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland has no pressure at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resulting political consequences do not need to be considered for the time being. Only the surviving forces need to consider political issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, in Hudson's view, as long as the human race wins the continental war again and there is no threat from alien races, the human race alliance will fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, the \"united survival\" has receded into the background, and big mergers are the mainstream of the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if overnight, war became the mainstream of the mainland. Regardless of the countries that have already started fighting, all countries on the mainland have embarked on the road of expanding their arms and preparing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the benchmark of the Northern Continent, once the Alpha Kingdom made a move, all countries followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the Principality of Moxi was the most active. King George, who was confused, simply ordered to copy the Alpha model.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a few years ago, I dug out a wave of footholds from the Alpha Kingdom, and brought in the experience. Now I just need to promote it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One reserve army in one county, with as many troops as possible. Even the young and mature population that was hidden in the past has been brought out this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the army of the Principality of Moxi on paper returned to its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defense line in the border area has also started a new round of reinforcement. The Moxi nobleman, who suffered a loss once, went to supervise the construction by himself this time, and would never allow the bureaucrats to stretch out their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that social beatings can make people progress the most. It is also copying the mobilization mechanism of the Alpha Kingdom, and the one that has really been implemented is the Moxi Principality, which has been severely beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization order was also issued immediately, but their actions were much slower than those of the resident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the speed is slow, but everyone still acted. The feudal nobles from all over the country also followed suit, and they did not passively sabotage their work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this obviously doesn't satisfy Orton XIX. In normal times, he, the king, is a salted fish, but in times of crisis he becomes a living fish again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everything is trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What does the Ministry of Military Affairs do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why did it take so long for the order to be issued, and the formation of reserve corps in various places is still a mess?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it yourself, why don't you just copy it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, this war is different from the past!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many big countries in front of us, the Warhammer Kingdom has been abolished, and the army of the elves and the ancient survivors may come over at any time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theory and practice are not the same thing after all. The Principality of Orton, which has been beaten once, has indeed given birth to a sense of crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that they have been involved in the war for too short a time. The orc army just borrowed from their country, and before they understood what was going on, the enemy had already left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to talk about accumulating experience, then you will have more experience of losing battles, and then there will be no more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Ministry of Military Affairs cannot be entirely blamed for this matter. The training of reserve forces in various places has indeed begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem now is: people are called together, but we lack the experience of specific training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In many areas, serfs died due to overtraining. Facts have proved that the training of serf soldiers is not the same as that of knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are considering sending people to the Alpha Kingdom to learn experience, or directly recruiting military instructors from them to help us complete reserve training. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Jacob helped explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then why are you still in a daze, if you have a way, hurry up and implement it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, immediately send someone to coordinate the relationship. At this moment of crisis, the Alpha Kingdom would not fail to help. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Orton XIX, who still felt that it was not enough, continued to add: \"Not only do we have to learn, but we also send people to inform neighboring countries, so that they can also send people to study.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this time of crisis, everyone is hurt. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs tried its best to convince countries that only by allowing more countries to participate in the preparations for war can we have a chance! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is so profound, it will directly shock the officials. Everyone never imagined that the king who eats, drinks and plays every day, and doesn't take much care of things, actually has this kind of insight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, comprehensively learning the Alpha model in the military also means that we must move closer to them politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the evaluation and employment of military instructors, let the Alpha people directly intervene in our army. Originally, they were the largest country in the Northern Continent, if this happened again, all countries in the Northern Continent would have to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Foreign Minister Dubs could finish speaking, Orton Nineteenth interrupted impatiently: \"Okay, stop talking so much nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, what you mean is nothing more than saying: Doing so will break the balance, and in the future the Alpha Kingdom will dominate the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is there to worry about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all things in the future, let's live into the future first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy's soldiers cannot be stopped, the Principality of Orton will no longer exist before the Alpha Kingdom dominates the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality is almost gone, why do you want me to take care of the international situation? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it. After I die, let him be flooded!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Orton is gone, not to mention the possibility of the Alpha Kingdom to dominate the Northern Continent, even if it is to unify the Northern Continent, it doesn't matter about Orton XIX.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things about the future should be considered in the future, and the right way is to take care of the present first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the battlefield is full of uncertainties. A strong country can decline in a war, and a weak country can also rise in a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The universe is uncertain, everything is possible!\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After completing the formulation of the emergency plan, he returned to the territory as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is a matter of the future. The most important thing right now is to deal with the group of Warcraft captives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a well-known fact that wild monsters are difficult to domesticate. Hudson doesn't think he has the aura of domineering, and he can make these monsters surrender as soon as he shows up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he really has this ability, it is useless. What Hudson needs is for these monsters to sign contracts with their subordinates, not with themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lower the level of Warcraft, the easier it is to admit death. Their limited IQ is simply not enough to support thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the contract cannot be completed, then these monsters can only be kept locked up, waiting to be used as breeding beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention wasting resources, feeding is also a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't pay attention, even if you jump out, you can turn the territory upside down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, there are more ordinary people in the mountain leaders. Even if there are hundreds of knights, most of them are low-level knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you found a solution?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the days when you left, the few of us searched all the information, but still couldn't find a reliable solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the records in the data, except for God's Chosen One like you, the best way for ordinary people to sign a contract with Warcraft is to subdue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can only be singled out, and no external force can be used. Otherwise, Warcraft will not be convinced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they win, the probability of Warcraft surrendering will not exceed one-third. There are no rules, and whether the contract can be successfully signed depends entirely on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, a special contract can also be used to force a contract to be signed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, such scrolls rarely appear on the market, and occasionally appear at auctions, and the price will not be lower than five thousand gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that these contracts can only be contracted with low-level monsters. If the middle and high-level monsters are forcibly contracted, there is still a risk of backlash. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Redman said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, everyone has a dream of being a Warcraft knight, and he is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at a group of magical beast cubs, Redman was envious for a long time. If it weren't for Hudson's persuasion that low-level monsters didn't fit his status, he would have become a daddy of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally waiting for the opportunity, I found out embarrassingly that I was too high or too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of his great knight, low-level monsters can win, but they don't match his status; mid-level monsters are worthy of his status, but he can't beat them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (low level 1~3, middle level 4~6, great knight 4)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, don't worry, since the monster is in our hands, it won't be able to fly out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For low-level monsters, arrange people to challenge them. Whoever gets the approval of the monster will be their mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unwilling to surrender, then continue to challenge with substitutions. If you can't do it once, you can do it twice, and if you can't do it twice, you can do it three times. Slowly consume them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the eight mid-level monsters, I will ask Bear Stearns to find a chance to talk with them, maybe one day they will figure it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, your mount will definitely not be missing. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Hudson looks calm, but in fact Hudson has nothing in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intermediate monsters have a certain amount of intelligence and can communicate normally, but that doesn't mean they have a good temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many people who would rather die than submit. If a few words can convince them, the number of Warcraft knights will not be so small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Use magic to enforce the contract, forget it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the high cost, but also the high risk. If there is a backlash on the battlefield, it will be fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of doing this, it is better for everyone to challenge, just as an actual combat training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the lack of masters under his command, Hudson, a mid-level monster, would also like to arrange it that way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the power system of the Mountain Territory is broken. Both the high-end combat power and the grass-roots combat power are not bad, but the middle part is vacant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in this part can only be filled by time. Even if he could poach the wall, Hudson didn't dare to use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is knight cultivation or magic cultivation, it consumes a lot of resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The declining little nobles simply cannot afford to support this level of masters. Hudson is worried about the masters who are involved with the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bring these people in to take power, maybe one day when they return from a long trip, the territory will change owners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oh well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, tell Bear Stearns. If you can't agree, you can't swallow my magic beast in one gulp. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Redman said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mid-level monsters have tempers, and high-level monsters have even stronger tempers. The bear of the earth is also a representative of violent temper, and it is also the nature of the race to fight when there is a disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Bear Stearns is obviously an exception. Perhaps because of the influence of Hudson since he was a child, he prefers to use his brain first when encountering things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it was Maxim's temper, which was more uncontrollable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I will watch from the sidelines, and no beast will be killed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to catch a few mid-level monsters and bring them back. He has paid a lot of money, how can he let them die so easily?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the episode, Hudson stepped into the laboratory again. As one of the few pharmacists in the territory, he also undertakes the important task of refining life essence and magic beast growth potion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no substitutes. The magician group in the Mountain Territory has a good name and is essentially a senior handyman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for Hudson to spend a lot of resources on a group of guys with limited talents and unknown loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to form the Warcraft Legion as soon as possible, the \"Scroll of Warcraft Contract\" has also become his research topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic contract scroll is not easy to use, but it does not mean that it can be used. If you encounter some stubborn low-level monsters, you still have to use one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of other factors, arrangements must be made for the convenience of breeding and breeding needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord's family has no food surplus, and the price of this kind of magic scroll, which is not worried about selling, has been floating in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is a great demand for the mountain territory. In addition to the monsters in his hands, Hudson also issued a monster acquisition task in the mercenary union.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is a female animal with normal fertility, the mountain leaders are willing to buy it. Anyway, even if the mother body is a Tier 1 monster, it can reach Tier 3 with the blessing of the dragon's bloodline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a fire-type monster of the same attribute, the cubs after hybridization may still be able to cross the middle-level threshold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the experiences summed up in the previous breeding process. The major forces can produce so many female beasts, but in fact most of them are Tier 1 monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, just because the first-order monsters have the strongest reproductive ability, the largest number, the widest distribution, and the easiest to be caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no continental war, it is estimated that Hudson will slowly accumulate female beasts, and let Maxim breed again when the number is almost the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is different now. The complicated situation makes Hudson feel that it is necessary to speed up the construction of the Warcraft Legion. In addition to issuing missions to acquire female beasts, he is also preparing to go out to capture monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has experience in raising magical beast cubs. Bear Stearns is the best case. With sufficient energy management, the original journey of hundreds of years was completed in a few years, and no side effects were found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bear is like this, let alone other low-level Warcraft cubs, the growth time will only be shorter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is completely feasible to mature an army of Warcraft within a year or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a bit faster, but everyone can accept it. After all, the adulthood time of low-level monsters is not long, the shortest is six or seven years, and the longest is ten or twenty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current level of ripening potions on the mainland, it only takes three or four years for a low-level magical beast cub to grow up from birth to adulthood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the dosage is recklessly increased without considering the sequelae, it can be ripened within two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of sequelae, that is something in the future, and it will not explode immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone realized that something was wrong and found that the Warcraft Legion in the Mountain Territory was unusual, it would be many years later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fearing that the efficacy of the potion will be leaked and being peeped at now does not mean that there will be such worries in the future. In the final analysis, the world is always dominated by the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is the cost. The natural growth of monsters is to absorb energy from the world. Relying on the potion to accelerate the ripening is to pour energy directly into the monster's body to speed up the growth process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waste in the process of energy conversion is inevitable. It is impossible to create an adult monster with the energy of a magic core.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific consumption standard still varies from beast to beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before reaching the limit of the bloodline of the monster itself, as long as there is enough energy, it can be promoted all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, Bear Stearns, the speed of absorbing energy has dropped a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An adult Earth Bear can become a Bear King not just by relying on energy, but also needs to understand the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road ahead, any earth bear can cross it when it grows up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to really test your talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is a \"Xiong Cai\" or a \"Xiong Cai\", you will know if you can pass this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim is slightly better, but he is also about to reach the bottleneck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also at a loss as to the cultivation at the sanctuary level. He had only seen it in an ancient book, and it was the second level of the legendary sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no relevant information from the outside world. It is because the number of sanctuary powerhouses in the human world is too small, and even fewer can cross the second level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone lacks talent, but the main reason is that human life span is too short. Warcraft can spend thousands of years grinding in one realm, and humans are completely incomparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one breaks through the sanctuary, it is difficult to live to be three hundred years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the body organs are aging, even if there is some understanding, the body cannot support a breakthrough to a higher level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even the sanctuary realm is now a hurdle for countless heroes of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the records of the last millennium, the strong humans who were able to break through the sanctuary were all during the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heroes are born in troubled times, and perhaps only through the tempering of blood and fire can a truly strong man be born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another, the animal skins were reduced to crumbs in Hudson's hands, which still could not shake his determination to study the \"contract\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After countless failed attempts, Melissa on the side finally couldn't help it: \"Hudson, why don't you try me instead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson nodded a little embarrassedly, and then gave up the test bench.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidence needs to be set off. If a person keeps failing, he will definitely collapse after a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different if someone fails with you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of alchemy and pharmaceuticals, their husband and wife are at the same level, and they are both representatives of people who are addicted to vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa has no reliable research and development results, and Hudson has a lot of research and development results, but that is based on cheating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is that, according to Melissa, most magicians are like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who can produce results can be called: alchemist, alchemist...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are many reliable results, or if the formula of the predecessors is improved, then they can be crowned with the title of \"Master\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the outside world, Hudson is a magic potion master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the motivation for Melissa to persist in research and development. After all, with such a good pharmacy master by her side, it is easy to feel that I can do it myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson fully supports this hobby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the circle of nobles is too chaotic. Few of those ladies who are like courtesans are clean.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting Melissa hang out with those people every day, it is really hard for him to rest assured, it is better to stay in the laboratory and toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, we will lose some raw materials, which Master Hudson can afford.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, Melissa is not completely unproductive, and some simple healing potions can still be made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still some distance from the balance of payments, but overall the loss is not much. Almost a thousand and eight hundred gold coins are paid out every month, which can be regarded as the normal expenses of a lady.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sound of \"噗嗤\", the animal skin lying on the test bench immediately burst into flames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experienced Melissa threw a water polo technique and extinguished the fire in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed was so fast that even Hudson didn't have time to react.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's stop here today. I'll go to the Arcane Academy later, ask those old guys for advice, and then come...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could finish speaking, Melissa clung to his arms and said excitedly: \"Take me, those people are great magisters!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If those students know that I have the opportunity to ask the great magister for advice, they will definitely be jealous...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, the great magister is too far away from the life of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Melissa, a nobleman with an extraordinary background, the instructors at the Magic Academy are nothing more than mages (level 5), and some lecturers are even just great magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the great magister, even the magister seldom comes out to give lectures. Even if they accept students, they only recruit those with outstanding talents, and ordinary students like Melissa are simply not available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the matter Hudson, if it's embarrassing, forget it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson didn't answer, Melissa said regretfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course not, I am also the honorary headmaster of the Arcane Academy, so I still have a bit of face with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just didn't expect that our Miss Melissa is so hardworking, she has stayed in the magic academy for so long and has never even had contact with a great magister! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson teased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You, bully...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the joint efforts of all parties, the representatives of the two divided aristocratic camps, the East and the West, finally made it to the negotiating table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II, who was on the main seat, looked embarrassed at the moment. I can't wait to dig a hole out of the ground and drill in directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the king, he needs to bear the main responsibility for bringing the situation of the kingdom to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others play with balance in politics, so he also plays with balance. As a result, other monarchs consolidated the kingship, and he started a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to reconcile the contradictions between the two noble camps of the East and the West, but because of his vacillating positions, both sides were dissatisfied with him. So much so that the situation got out of hand, and the kingdom was on the verge of splitting.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

He never expected that his subordinates would be so shameless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are having a family split, for the sake of the kingdom's face, you should put on a show in front of outsiders!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the illusion of Joseph II was finally shattered. Representatives of the two camps expressed in practical actions that they did not want to recognize him as the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for being bound by the rules of the game, it is unknown whether the king Joseph II would have survived to this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is so cruel. The political balance seems to be played by every monarch, but not everyone can play smoothly. Once the game crashes, you have to bear the price of backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone calm down, I invite you here today to solve the problem, not to intensify the conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the ancient survivors is pressing down on the land, and the elves are also ready to move. The Warhammer Kingdom has reached the most dangerous moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you continue to make trouble like this, everyone should know what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance cannot be counted on in a short time, and now we can only rely on ourselves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The division of the Warhammer Kingdom is what the Principality of Moxi wants to see, but the premise is to wait until after the Continental War instead of collapsing at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unified Warhammer Kingdom can hardly block the front of foreign soldiers, and the Warhammer Kingdom in civil strife is even more hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be delayed for a day. In order to buy time for his family, Earl Francis had to go to the countries of the Northern Continent to mediate the internal disputes of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Renato, I let you see a joke today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has come to this point, all of us are responsible, but some people are always unwilling to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destined not to be the same people, instead of reluctantly getting together and fighting each other every day, it is better to simply separate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the tears of Marshal Borg had already fallen. As the pillar of the Warhammer Kingdom, now he wants to split the kingdom he has fought for most of his life with his own hands, the feeling is really indescribable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, people can't help themselves in the aristocratic circle. As a representative of the nobles in the west of the kingdom, he must first safeguard the interests of the group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being suppressed by the eastern aristocrats for hundreds of years, it was hard to gain the upper hand once. As a result, not only did it fail to win more rights, but it triggered a civil war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has developed to this point, he has no way to retreat, and the interest groups behind him are pushing him forward as a spokesperson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Separate, separate, as if someone begged you to be together! You know how to fight for power all day long. Without you guys, the kingdom will only develop better!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Gay fought against each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since we are going to the opposite side, we cannot lose momentum. It has nothing to do with personal preferences, everyone is backed by interest groups, and he also has no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the negotiations reached an impasse. Separation is not as simple as talking about it, it also involves territory division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The civil war has been fought, so it is no wonder that the border line can be agreed upon in a few words. If you get entangled around this issue, things will be troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Calm down, both of you, whether or not to split up is your internal matter, as an outsider, it is inconvenient for us to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But you have to think clearly about one thing. Now that the alien army has overwhelmed the country, the Kingdom of Warhammer is at a critical juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the ancient survivors alone has made everyone tired of dealing with it. If the elves send troops again, it will be even more troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this critical moment, we need to temporarily abandon the contradictions and unite to tide over the difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do this, then you can take a gamble to see if the alien army will show mercy to your subordinates!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how big the conflict of interest is, it must survive first. You should think about it carefully, the time left for us is running out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Gustavo tried hard to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Alpha Kingdom's envoy to the Warhammer Kingdom, he is now on a mission. The life and death of the Warhammer Kingdom is not important, the key is to buy time for oneself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the people in front of them persist for one more day, the Alpha Kingdom will have one more day to prepare. Against this background, he naturally didn't want to see the situation get into trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Gustavo, there is nothing wrong with the reasoning, but some issues are not clearly explained now, and will be even more unclear in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside other issues, who will the king follow after the separation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't our two families continue to co-host?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, let's be generous. In view of your heavy losses in the orc invasion, let His Majesty the King follow you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens that the royal family's territory is mostly concentrated in the eastern region, and the family is divided directly by region, so there is no need to be entangled in this issue. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said with a look of disgust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is downgrading from a kingdom to a principality. As long as you can get rid of Joseph II, it's worth paying a little price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The western nobles are unwilling to want Joseph II as king, but it does not mean that the eastern nobles welcome him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the last orc invasion, both the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi handed over their armies to the most capable generals, but Joseph II, in order to play a political balance, went to the imperial conquest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king personally leads troops to the battlefield, which is also the norm in the continent of Aslante, and there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the battle is lost, there will be problems everywhere. Joseph II, who had ruined his family, naturally became the most unpopular person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to get rid of the blame, he is the one who rushed to be the coach, and he personally gave the order, so naturally he has to bear the responsibility for the failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Borg, you can't say that. Our political system is mature, the government team is stable, and we can operate without anyone. Compared with you, you need Your Majesty to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has been friends for many years. At this time, how can we take advantage?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, there is no need to worry. The land of the royal family can also be replaced. We passed it in a short while, which happened to solve the current territorial conflict problem by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Prime Minister Guy's words came out, everyone was instantly dumbfounded. After a long time, the focus of conflict between the East and West camps in the Warhammer Kingdom turned into \"I don't want a king\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A king can be disliked to this extent, and Joseph II can be regarded as a historical precedent. Needless to say, abdicate directly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about Joseph II's showy operations in the past few years, even the royalists have nothing to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't insisted on going his own way, with the strength of the Warhammer Kingdom, he wouldn't have lost so badly in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had responded positively from the beginning, they had every hope of keeping most of the kingdom's territory and not being baptized by the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eastern nobles hated Joseph II's blind command, causing them to lose their hometown; Western nobles hated him for using the coalition of western nobles as cannon fodder in order to maintain balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this kind of thing happened, he should take the initiative to admit his mistake, abdicate and take responsibility, so as to ease domestic conflicts. It's a pity that Joseph II is just stubbornly dominating the position and refusing to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the subsequent reconstruction work, Joseph II continued to pursue his balanced strategy, and carried out the show operation to the end, so that the royalists did not want to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato and Gustavo looked at each other, and both of them showed helpless expressions. Asking the king to abdicate is also taboo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is worried about offending Joseph II, but mainly because of his boss's thoughts. If it hurts him to be missed, it will be a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They don't mind leaving and slamming doors if they can get out of the way. However, the situation on the battlefield requires them to reconcile the internal conflicts of the Warhammer Kingdom. Even if they know that mixing such things will not lead to good results, they can only bite the bullet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what do you think of this matter?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a miracle for the king to be in this position. Renato was very skeptical that if Joseph II continued to toss, he would be able to send himself to the guillotine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the greater possibility is sudden death. Since the end of the Holy See era, there has been no precedent for the execution of a king in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Joseph II slapped the table and said: \"Haven't you already made arrangements, why are you asking me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't you just want me to abdicate, as long as the unity of the kingdom can be maintained, I can make concessions! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, this was definitely a heartfelt sacrifice, but unfortunately now that the two factions have joined forces to force the palace, there is no room for maneuver in the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In this case, let the eldest prince and the second prince succeed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of fairness, the royal family is directly divided into two, and we will draw lots to decide which prince will be the monarch on which side. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing crueler than destroying the kingdom you have fought for most of your life with your own hands. But things have developed to this point, separation is already the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In past civil wars, both sides were stained with each other's blood, barely sitting together would only make the conflict more acute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Divide into two directly, with more royal leaders as a buffer, both sides have a chance to calm down and think about how to deal with the alien invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of cheers formed a critical blow to Joseph II, and he fainted on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frightened, everyone hurriedly called the pastor to rescue him. It doesn't matter if the joint-stock country is separated. If the king is forced to death, it will be in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the two sides chose two princes to succeed to the throne in order to avoid being charged with \"rebellious officials and thieves\". If Joseph II died here, it would be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, it was just anger. Under the priest's treatment, Joseph II recovered his life. It's just that the whole body has been severely injured, and it is no longer as high-spirited as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that the Warhammer Kingdom was split into two spread, and soon caused a major earthquake in the continent of Aslant. Although they still retain their titles and consider themselves orthodox, everyone knows that another kingdom has fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eastern Warhammer Kingdom\" and \"Western Warhammer Kingdom\", as you can tell by their names, this is the result of a compromise between the two parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, the countries of the human race must intervene! If you play so capriciously, where will the royal power go?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Warhammer royal family still inherits the throne, everyone knows that there is a high probability that the two new kings who have been released from the pink oven will be emptied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no chance to struggle, and the royal family's fortune was ruined by Joseph II. The remaining bit of strength, being able to keep the royal inheritance, is the result of everyone giving face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the monarchs of various countries think, Hudson does not know, anyway, he is very satisfied with the current situation of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes \"1+1\" is not equal to 2. After the two conflicting interest groups are separated, the chances of pitting each other against each other are reduced, but they can play a greater role on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next step is to protect their own interests, not afraid of their carelessness. Even if the Warhammer Kingdom falls, there will still be many noble castles that will survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ancient survivors are just a collective term. I am afraid that only they can figure out how many races there are in them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more people and more things, not to mention a multi-racial alliance. At the time of fighting the world at this moment, we can still fight together because of interests. After the results are achieved, it will be time to fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not every race has ambitions. Most of the ancient survivors just want to get a piece of land suitable for survival, and almost none of them want to compete for the hegemony of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that these people have no ambitions, it's that the ethnic population is limited. Especially for those small clans with a population of only tens of thousands, let them fight for hegemony on the mainland, do you really think they are per capita dragons?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, as long as the Warhammer Kingdom survives the first wave, the ancient survivors will be divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the human race is difficult to deal with, some unambitious races will choose to accept it as soon as it is good, and turn to attack to clean up the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alpha Kingdom, one less enemy means more chances of winning. Even if it is only a few small races, it may be the last straw that breaks the camel's back at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing on the pavilion, watching the knights challenge World of Warcraft in the arena, and looking down at the cheering crowd below, Hudson found that opening a \"Colosseum\" is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the knights in their own territory have finished their challenges, they can also relax the restrictions, and use the slogan that whoever defeats the monsters will belong to them, so as to attract knights from the outside world to challenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only can you sell tickets, but you can also charge a registration fee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the remaining monsters are all diehards among beasts, and they are not so easy to surrender. Even if they win, it is mostly for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't want to pay, as long as you help out once. Hudson is not demanding, just follow along during the Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, you are from the capital, how much do you know about the Colosseum?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the plan is good, it needs people to implement it. There is a colosseum in the entire southeastern province, that is, Beida City, which can explain many problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was easy to make money in this industry, nobles from all over the world would have followed suit, so it wouldn't be possible that it hasn't been promoted until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, the operation of the Colosseum is very simple, it is nothing more than a field, plus \"beast\" and \"human\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of mountain territories, it is not difficult to meet these conditions, the key lies in the difficulty of making profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying solely on ticket revenue can at most save capital, and the real money is the gambling commission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, selling some food, providing special services, and compensation after fights are also important sources of income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the actual situation of the territory, unless the Colosseum is placed in Dadir City to attract nobles from neighboring counties to come and watch, it will be difficult to achieve a balance of income and expenditure. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Jose's analysis, Hudson was also helpless. The mountain collar seems to have all internal organs, but this sparrow is too small after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Light industry is textiles, and heavy industry is ironmaking. But these are handicraft workshops, and the workers are completely attached to him, the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consumption power is a joke. Even if Hudson is willing to find gold as wages, these people can't spend it, or are reluctant to spend it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the premise that the lord provides basic necessities, food, housing and transportation, everyone's consumption desire is almost equal to zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, their shriveled pockets also determine their low desires. Life goal: to have a full meal, and further pursuit: to eat a good meal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spiritual pursuit, maybe tickets can be issued as rewards. After all, who can't rely on a group of guys who can't afford a few copper coins to spend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Increasing everyone's income, changing the ration system to cash payment, that can only be thought about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the income from the territory was used by Hudson to invest in the construction of the territory, and a small part was used to support the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous territories are still in a fiscal deficit, so how can there be any surplus value, which can be used for distribution!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the internal purchasing power is not enough, the external purchasing power will also fail to rise. Seeing that the mainland war is approaching, the nobles are busy expanding their armies and preparing for war. Who has spare money to spend?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then put the Colosseum in Dardir City!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of these monsters are stubborn. They have been defeated more than a dozen times in a row, but they have no intention of surrendering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Threats and lures, we have also tried, but it still has no effect, and the possibility of being recovered is already very low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply take it out as a prize, attracting knights from all over the world to challenge. According to our rules, whoever can make the monster surrender after the fight, then give it to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The registration fee is set at 50 gold coins. With such a small amount of money, in exchange for a chance to become a monster knight, many people should be hooked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is much safer to challenge in the arena than to go outside to try your luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as a few lucky ones succeed, the follow-up popularity will not worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, even the money for hiring gladiators was saved. If it is run well, maybe the Colosseum can make some money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, whether the Colosseum can make money is not the point, the key is to be able to promote the spirit of martial arts! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talking is not the point, but when it comes to actual actions, it's all about money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more war years, the more valuable the goods that can enhance the strength. Taking Warcraft cubs as an example, the price has soared by 40% compared to before the continental war broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because of the need for long-term cultivation, otherwise the price will rise even more fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a chance to get the master of an adult monster, even if it is only a low-level monster, the little nobles will also flock to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to ordinary knights, Warcraft knights have more advantages no matter whether they make achievements or run away after losing battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the success rate is low, there will be many people who can't help but come and try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the one-time registration fee is not much, but there are not only one monsters left for them to challenge, and it is not a small sum of money after one round of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, registration for the challenge is not immediately possible to make an appointment. The time spent queuing in the middle also requires a lot of consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is basic necessities of life, or going to watch a few games, they are all contributing profits to Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the income is good, Hudson doesn't mind not making this industry bigger and stronger, capturing more monsters and putting them in the Colosseum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, you can also hook up the monsters and feed them some Hashi growth potions to stimulate the enthusiasm of the nobles to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count, will the knights in the territory have any objections to doing this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, our Warcraft Legion plan has just started, and there are still many knights who are eagerly watching. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an outsider, there are usually many things to consider. Especially these things that touch the interests of the local knights have to be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I will tell everyone about this matter. If anyone has an opinion, let him come to me. You only need to elect a person in charge of the Colosseum.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lack of monsters is only a temporary thing. In recent days, neither Maxim nor Bear Stearns has been idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go out early and return late every day, and even go out for several days in a row, just stepping on the Blackstone Mountains. When the situation is almost understood, it's time to act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, for the sake of safety, these monsters will not be sent to the mountain territory immediately, but will make a big circle from the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are high-level magical beasts that follow the scent, they will go to other places first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, since you want to act, it is also a measured action. It's not that all the low-level monsters in a certain area are wiped out. If there are a few monsters in each area, it will not cause any waves at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, monsters are also predators of the jungle. It is very common for high-level monsters passing by to grab a few low-level monsters to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they don't settle down for a long time to grab territory, the local high-level monsters won't care. Even if they met head-on, it was nothing more than a matter of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you grasp the scale, things will be within the controllable range. The only problem is that in this way, the number of monsters that can be captured is limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is nothing, the number of knights in the mountain territory is not many. Even including the entire Koslow family, there are still not enough 800 knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the army still needs a commander, the Warcraft Legion only needs to have a staff of 300 people. Subsequent expansion of the establishment will have to wait for the younger generation to grow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all knights are eligible to challenge Warcraft. Those little guys who have just become knights are not opponents of Warcraft at all, they can only raise the cubs of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there is a large gap, but the actual demand is not as much as expected. The main purpose of continuing to capture monsters is to increase the survivability of the officers on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that most of these people are brought out by Hudson alone. I dare not say how powerful the ability is, at least they all came out of the sea of ​​corpses and blood.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

But when it comes to manpower, financial resources, and material resources, these countries combined are more than twice that of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically, by mobilizing all these countries, the fighting power of the two Alpha Kingdoms can be erupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately this is only theoretical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A country that has been born for war for a long time, and a group of countries that are used to living a peaceful life, cannot be at the same level in military terms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Northern Continent can mobilize the combat power of the three Alpha Kingdoms, even if they are not opponents of the three major alien races, they will be able to protect themselves as the defensive side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The countries of the Northern Continent have made a request to us, hoping that the kingdom can send military personnel to help them train the army. Do you think this can be done?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV pretended to be reserved and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to intervene in the internal affairs of various countries, especially the military, are rare. They would never have done this if it wasn't for the fact that the foreign races had brought too much pressure on the countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it is the general trend to send people to support the countries, unite all the powers of the northern continent, and jointly resist the invasion of alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since everyone has made an invitation, we must not only send someone to help, but we must also do this favor beautifully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is not only related to the safety of the Northern Continent, but also the rise and fall of the entire human race, and it will definitely have a profound impact on the future international situation! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister of Newfoundland said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to cultivate pro-Alpha faction in an upright manner was offered to the door, how could it be turned away?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's helping people train the army. Even the last time they sent troops to rescue the Principality of Moxi, the Alpha Kingdom gained a stable ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobles pays attention to interests, as well as human relations. It is also commonplace to make decisions because of personal emotional inclinations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the plan proceeds smoothly, the Northern Continent will form a large alliance with the Alpha Kingdom at its core after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, no matter how the situation on the mainland changes, the Alpha Kingdom remains invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the threat from the Kingdom of Hesse, even if the three major kingdoms in the central region advance northward together, they can all be blocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we send people to help them train the army, how much can the combat effectiveness of each country be improved, and is it possible to block the front of soldiers from other races?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prospect is bright, but the reality is tortuous. If there is a chance to integrate the power of the Northern Continent, it must first go through the current hurdle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, our Military Affairs Department made an assessment earlier, and the combined military strength of the countries in the Northern Continent is about 80% of the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, once the mobilization mechanism reform and military training are completed, their military strength can at least be doubled, but the reality is far from so optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countries did offer invitations, but in terms of specific implementation, there are still many difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those countries that are being threatened by alien races may be able to fully cooperate, but more countries may not have such strong determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the central governments of various countries are willing to cooperate, the local nobles and lords may not be willing to buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Copy our military mobilization system completely, and they are the ones whose interests are most seriously damaged. These people will not be willing to cut their flesh until the critical moment of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the kingdom, it was only after suffering many big losses that everyone united and had today's situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the foreign races attack with all their strength, I am afraid that many countries will be deeply involved in the flames of war before they can fully mobilize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people can only help nobles who are willing to cooperate to complete military mobilization training. The overall increase in military power of various countries may not be so optimistic! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero explained in a difficult way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it came to the Kingdom's strategic decision, he really didn't dare to overestimate the countries of the Northern Continent. After all, in the last orc invasion, the performance of these countries had already disappointed everyone once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't rely on the integrity of these guys to rise from the ground to the sky just because you change the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the nobles have vision, but they also have selfishness! If it is possible to increase strength, the first thing everyone thinks of is their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps many nobles will actively participate in military training, but when it comes time to send troops to participate in the war, all kinds of excuses will follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is rare that it is not military training, but mobilization mechanism reform. Without suffering a life-and-death crisis and cleaning out the diehards, there is no way to complete the reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, the Alpha Kingdom's mobilization mechanism was established, and there was no less bloodshed. It's just that time has passed too long, and it has gradually been forgotten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It counts as much as it can increase. At this time, every point of military strength is precious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, countries have a lot of demand for military officers. If so many people are dispatched at once, will the impact on the standing army be too great? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he said this, Caesar IV was obviously relieved. If countries can really complete the reform of the military mobilization mechanism at once, he will hesitate to help this favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom's military system is essentially all about military affairs. If all countries in the Northern Continent play like this, even a small country can become a hedgehog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the Counties of Korubia, which was annexed by the Hessians, as an example. It can only be regarded as an ordinary province in the Alpha Kingdom, but once it is fully mobilized, it can also pull out more than 100,000 to 200,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of combat effectiveness, as long as people can be organized, it will be a big deterrent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the calculation of 20% elite soldiers, such a force configuration, as the defensive side, is enough to make the Kingdom of Hesse dare not act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a question of whether it can be defeated, but the loss outweighs the gain if it occupies the place. The consumption of a large amount of military power is second, and the key is that it is difficult to establish rule after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Genocide cannot be played in the civil war of the human race. If there is too much blood on the hands, there will be many hidden dangers in the future governance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, not only did the Countess of Colombia not have such mobilization capabilities, but the nobles also did not have tens of thousands of elite private troops, so that they could only lie flat when danger came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small country can be mobilized to the limit, let alone countries with larger populations and larger territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there are not many countries in the North Continent that can learn the essence. Otherwise, if they come up with so many hedgehogs, they will be looking for excitement for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Majesty, the Ministry of Military Affairs has already made plans for the issue of dispatching officers. Except for the transfer of some officers from the standing army, the remaining vacancies will be apportioned to the provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the newly recovered seven provinces of the Northland, the provinces of other kingdoms can completely help a country with one province. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has only been a few years since the orcs invaded, and it was the time when the Alpha Kingdom had the most military talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, as long as the children of nobles stay on the battlefield for a year or two, they can become good grassroots officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must be enough to send out to help allies train troops. After all, the Alpha Kingdom now only needs to help countries train a large number of cannon fodder troops, not to train elites for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the military capability is too strong, it cannot be sent out. If someone poached the foot of the wall, it would be a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For details, please refer to the poaching operation of the Principality of Moxi. Just leaving some small and medium-sized nobles, everyone didn't think there was any problem at first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But looking back now, you will find that it was this group of humble nobles who switched jobs and had a profound impact on the military development of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the outbreak of the Continental War, the Principality of Moxi, who followed behind to learn, became the first country in the Northern Continent to copy the Alpha system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the biggest hero behind this is the orc.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the crazy slaughter of the orc army, at the cost of millions of lives, which awakened the sense of crisis of the Moxi nobles, the restructuring would definitely not have been so smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well! Since the Ministry of Military Affairs has a response plan, it will be implemented according to your plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The integration of the kingdom's military forces is also urgent, so send someone to urge Earl Hudson to come to the capital to perform his duties earlier. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he doesn't like Hudson. Moxi's miserable experience on the battlefield is one reason, and the other is that as a peer, he always has to be compared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a young and vigorous age, few people are willing to admit that they are inferior to others, and Caesar IV, who was born on the ceiling, is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as a king, there are times when he is powerless. The mainland war involved too much, a little carelessness would be the disaster of subjugation of the country, and he could not let himself be willful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the princes and ministers in the court to the feudal nobles in the local area, they all hope that Hudson, who is reliable in ability and character, can come out to preside over the overall situation at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the lessons learned by Joseph II and the car rollover incident on the Moxi battlefield, Caesar IV really didn't dare to toss about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that if he insisted on going his own way and presided over the military affairs of the kingdom himself, the Alpha Kingdom might change its king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not convinced, he really doesn't have much confidence in the military. Not to mention the local nobles, even the military affairs department of the capital is unwilling to see him dictating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to lose your temper, the princes and nobles in the court will do ideological work for him together. Many times, Caesar IV wanted to replace the minister of military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is easy to make substitutions, but it is difficult to find a suitable substitute. Grand Duke Alfiero is a member of the royal family, and he is a proper royalist faction. He can't be replaced by someone from another faction, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to whether his kingship is stable, Caesar IV is still very sober. I know that I can't destroy my foundation just for the sake of a momentary pleasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking for a substitute within the royal family, just think about it. If he really had such a great talent, Caesar III would have dug it out long ago, and it was simply not his turn to dig gold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are not many members of the Alpha royal family, and all adult males are added together, and there are only a few dozen people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are capable have been reused a long time ago; those who are not capable, even if they want to be reused, they can't be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In essence, Caesar IV is not a strong monarch. A large part of the reason for being able to keep the royal power from being damaged is the government team left by Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Members of the royal family occupy the core position and cooperate with the monarch to govern together, which ensures the smooth transition of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't have this team, even if he hadn't been ostracized, his life would definitely not be as easy as it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, Hudson, who didn't know that he was missed, is busy patrolling the territory at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Colosseum is just a small episode, and the freshly released Warcraft Legion is the focus of his attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are 273 monster knights in the territory, but only 160 of them can be incorporated into the monster army, and the rest are holding important positions in various departments. There is still a huge gap between the full number of 300 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more pitiful is that among the one hundred and sixty monster knights, there are more than ninety knight monsters, which are in their infancy at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to truly form combat power, wait until the Warcraft becomes an adult! It is estimated that there is still one year to go. It is not that the speed cannot be accelerated, but the main concern is that it will attract the attention of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many monsters have been ripened in advance, there is no way to keep secrets. Once the speed of ripening exceeds the range of everyone's cognitive acceptance, it will inevitably lead to a lot of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't want to be a master of pharmacy leading the progress of the times, even if he can make money. It's only a matter of time before the scumbag goes to pretend to be a top student.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the neatly lined up team, Hudson nodded in satisfaction. Let's do this now, it won't be too late to complete the final transformation on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Warcraft Legion failed to unify the mounts. From a distance, the momentum is not so powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems, just enjoy yourself if you can gather so many monster knights, why are you picky?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those big countries were able to cobble together a unified Warcraft mount, and it was also a wealth that was slowly accumulated over decades, or even hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, Hudson's semi-finished Warcraft Legion can be ranked in the top five.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the full compilation is completed, it will be the top three in the kingdom, and it may surpass the Warcraft Legion in the hands of the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one that can be held down steadily is the Warcraft Legion built with the strength of the kingdom. It is a pity that due to internal struggles, the scale of the establishment has shrunk significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, there are only more than 800 Warcraft knights. Like Hudson's Warcraft Legion, most of them are also in their infancy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It goes without saying that a 300-member Warcraft Legion can play a more effective role on the battlefield than a 10,000-man infantry corps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High mobility, high attack power, almost invincible in field battles, no matter how elite human infantry can stop the frontal charge of the monster army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the grassland battlefield, Hudson witnessed the scene of the Warcraft Legion charging with his own eyes. An army of thousands of ground dragons defeated a bear army of heavy infantry directly from the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how thick the armor is, it cannot withstand the feet of a monster. The gap between the ordinary army and the extraordinary army is really too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Adrian Knight, how do you train every day?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from ordinary cavalry training, Hudson's training of the Warcraft Legion is also blind. In addition to emphasizing discipline and cooperation, the rest can only be explored by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, in addition to the daily queue training, we are now studying the cooperative operations between the Warcraft Knight squads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Different monsters are formed together, and the combat power they can display is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After many attempts, we regrouped the knights according to the cooperation between the monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The focus of the next step of training will be the joint charge, and the cooperation of long-range monsters to carry out magical strikes on the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic crossbow coordination...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of specific tactics came out of Adrian's mouth, and Hudson could only nod constantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not yet clear how the real combat effectiveness is. At least theoretically, these trainings are feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Many Warcraft cubs are underage, and being able to train them to this level is considered pretty good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to work hard later, in the end, it is not me who is responsible for the results inspection, but the cruel race battlefield!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current training is only to enhance your survivability on the battlefield. Sweat more in normal times, and bleed less on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This continental war is just a sharpening in your life. After this step, you will have a better future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha is martial, and titles and wealth must be obtained from horseback. You have now gone one step further, starting directly from Warcraft Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson worked hard to paint the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to let everyone believe that there is a future in mixing with Master Hudson, he can only use a big trick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, most of these knights are young knights, who are at the age of youth and enthusiasm, so they are easy to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the call for racial justice, in front of Hudson's half-truth and half-fake pie painting, the atmosphere of the scene was directly filled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    See you in the evening for the next chapter, vote up\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you have any needs, you can ask the Ministry of Government Affairs, and they will be responsible for making arrangements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Go ahead and do your work, I still have to go around! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hierarchical world is so cruel, the slightest expression of emotion by the superior will make the people below tremble with fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson doesn't explain, maybe many students will suffer unwarranted disasters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation at the scene, it is not difficult to understand why the pharmacist is in such a desperate situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The priest only needs a magic spell to restore the wounded immediately, but the pharmacist has to make such a big scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's just like this, it's not unacceptable since the side effects are smaller than magic spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a \"magic pharmacist\" competing with them. They are also playing medicine, and their status is completely different if there are two more words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the effect of magic potion is not as immediate as that of divine magic, it is faster and has better healing effect than ordinary potion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many diseases that cannot be cured by potions can be cured immediately with a pair of magic potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, nobles naturally valued magic potions with better effects. As for the issue of medical costs, that is not a category that big shots need to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the ruler, and facing the suppression of the Holy See, it is not easy for pharmacists to keep their inheritance, let alone fight for their social status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the hard life of pharmacists that after Hudson issued a recruitment order, he was able to gather teachers in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And the level of all the applicants is not low, and there is no such thing as fake. In the continent of Aslant, the price paid by the common people to deceive the nobles is often the death of their families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has always been tolerant of talents. Even if the social status of a pharmacist is very low, the treatment they get in the mountains is still not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect is also obvious. These pharmacy apprentices who have been studying for a period of time have been able to prepare the simplest potions to treat some common diseases of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how poor the medical system is, it is better than nothing. Thanks to the efforts of these pharmacists, the mortality rate of infants and young children in the territory has dropped significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results have proved that the promotion of pharmacy at the grassroots level is correct, so it is natural to increase investment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's inspection was actually for the territorial bureaucrats to see. Tell them with practical actions that the lord attaches great importance to the training of pharmacists, and the corresponding work must be done well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the development is good, the medical rescue team will also enter the army in the near future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of efficiency alone, priests are indeed more suitable for the army, but that thing is deadly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many veterans who received the priest's treatment aged very quickly, and had to retire from the battlefield within a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic potions are the most ideal, but the price remains high, and it is not easy to meet the needs of military officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given the choice, Hudson still doesn't like using soldiers as consumables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the troops he commands each time are mostly cannon fodder, he will try to reduce casualties as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to this philosophy, the casualties in all the wars Hudson participated in were kept at a low level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One-third of his title as a famous general was advertised by the orcs, one-third was the admiration among the nobles, and one-third was the fans of the low-level soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, he was not as famous as he is now. On the contrary, after the war ended, after a lot of publicity from fans, his \"famous general label\" became popular among the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going all the way, looking at the mountains and rivers he had conquered, Hudson couldn't help feeling a surge of pride.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting a business is difficult. Looking back, he himself finds it unbelievable to manage such a large business in just a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The endless swamp is the place where his dream started, and now it has turned into a large area of ​​fertile land. Maybe it won't be long before the swamp will become history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking down the canal, Hudson couldn't help smiling as he watched the smoke rising from both sides of the river.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The canal economy has already started. Although it is still a seedling, the tolls are not enough for the maintenance of the canal. That is a good start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troubled times bring not only \"risks\", but also \"opportunities\". Whether we can make further progress in troubled times depends on whether we can overcome the crisis and seize opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, this warship is the first large warship built after the shipyard moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The designed ship is 72 meters long, 17 meters wide, and has a displacement of 2,486 tons. It is planned to be equipped with six magic crystal cannons and a medium-sized magic crossbow...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The full crew is 923 people, and the whole ship needs to depict 36 magic circles of various types. The normal sailing speed is 15 kilometers per hour, and the maximum speed of driving the magic circle can reach 30 kilometers per hour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is affected by the wind direction, the speed will increase slightly if the wind is downwind, and the speed will decrease accordingly if the wind is headwind...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he was worried that Hudson would not understand, Sears tried to use plain language as much as possible, but it was actually useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a lot of words, Hudson finally remembered that this warship entered the second echelon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's impression, a large ship, a large number of magic crystal cannons, and a high level of magic circle equal strong combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The largest warship currently has a displacement of more than 3,000 tons. The level of the magic circle is unknown, anyway, there are four more magic crystal cannons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in addition to increasing the number of magic crystal cannons, there are also people working **** magic crystal cannons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not clear about the specific development step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the magic crystal cannon he needs now is purchased directly from the Ministry of Military Affairs, which can basically represent the most advanced technology of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Independent research and development, no idea yet. The technical content of the magic crystal cannon is too high, and the mountain collar will not be able to touch it in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a pile of cannon-casting materials in hand, it is only a theoretical basis, and there is still a long way to go from the current advanced level of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the continental war, after some unlucky small countries were shattered, there would be an outflow of talents of this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until then, don't count on it. As far as Hudson knows, among the great nobles in the Alpha Kingdom, there are only two or three that can independently cast magic crystal cannons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other big families did not do it themselves, not without technical reserves, mainly because of cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the magic crystal cannon was a niche product. Except for the large aristocrats engaged in overseas trade and living in northern Xinjiang, the needs of most aristocrats were very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of cities in the hands is only so many. All are equipped, and there are only a few dozen doors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These big guys don't need to be replaced every day. Once they are on the city wall, they usually serve for 30 years, and they can be used after two or three hundred years of maintenance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small market demand, running to open a production line must be a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one family can't do it, then everyone should work together. Except for a few wealthy and independent aristocrats with high demand, the rest get their goods from the Ministry of Military Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, this is obviously a good thing. This means that at the start-up stage, you can directly buy the finished product of the magic crystal cannon, without spending a lot of time and investing a huge amount of money in production and research and development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Sears, when will this warship be ready for service?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked, pointing to the keel in the dock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced by the war. If it weren't for the sudden outbreak of the Continental War, Hudson would definitely go step by step now, first building canal merchant ships and pirate ships to accumulate experience, and then slowly getting involved in ocean-going merchant ships and warships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Continental War broke out, the original plan could not keep up with the times. In order to meet the actual needs, Hudson must build several merchant ships that can deal with pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not for trade, it's just to protect its own merchant ships and be able to transport a large number of people back from overseas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army has made a comeback. Without external support, it is only a matter of time before the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has made statistics. In the past two or three years, the population of the major powers successively transported to the prairie has been at least three to four million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people, the evacuation will definitely not be completed in a while. The rich and powerful could not protect themselves, let alone their serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it was accepting refugees in the past, or buying serfs directly from local noble lords, it was a good deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's requirements are not high, as long as it can receive 10% or 20% of the population, it is enough for the mountains to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the countries in the west of the Northern Continent have more populations, but the journey in the middle is too far away, and they have to pass through many countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is it difficult to transport, but it is also prone to various accidents. Even if a large number of refugees are accepted, only a small number of them can travel thousands of miles, or even tens of thousands of miles, to reach the mountain territory safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More refugees either fell on the way, or defected to new masters along the way. But if there is a choice, who would like to walk all the way foolishly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't think about yourself, you have to think about your family. The vast majority of old people and children cannot bear this kind of long-distance trek.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, the sea route is more reliable. Although the death rate at sea is also high, it is much lower than that of foot migration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, my lord earl, we have already pressed ahead with the construction period, and it is expected that the warship will be launched by the end of next month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the installation of the armaments on the follow-up warship goes smoothly, the arrival time of the magic crystal cannon will not be delayed, and the installation will be completed in about two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The subsequent characterization of the magic circle requires the help of people from the Magic Academy. How long it will take is uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other warships have just completed the keel laying because the construction started later, and the completion time is expected to be a few months later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Lord Earl, you can rest assured that we are doing our best to complete the construction of the warship in the shortest possible time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Sears pledged immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While confident, there is also a trace of fear between his brows. The whole shipyard has indeed worked hard, but hard work does not mean that the lord is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the military sent people to urge the ship every now and then, Sears knew that the lord took this matter very seriously, lest the progress of shipbuilding would not meet the requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While meeting the deadline, the quality of the warship must also be guaranteed. The vast sea is full of various uncertainties, and any negligence may cause disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the magic crystal cannon and magic circle, I will personally come forward to coordinate with them, and it will not affect your construction progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides these warships, don't forget about the merchant ships that are under construction. No matter how many difficulties there are, these ships must all be put into use within the year! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered without a doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time limit is indeed tight, but it is not impossible to complete. Before coming, he also did his homework, and roughly figured out the time required to build warships and merchant ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is just a wooden warship, the power is mainly driven by manpower, and the technical content in the process of building the hull is not that high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really has technical content is the magic crystal cannon that needs to be installed later, and the magic circle that must be arranged by magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the cost of shipbuilding is also spent on the two later stages. Just building a few ships, in fact, it really doesn't cost much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, please rest assured, our shipyard will definitely complete the task on time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sears immediately promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    vote one vote\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you go online casually, you will gain a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, look, the Skull and Bones are hiding at sea?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the eagerness to fight, you know that this is a bear-like way to say hello to an old friend. As a creature with a high IQ, Bear Stearns is very vengeful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the skeleton would want to use him as the vehicle for the arrival of the evil god, many years have passed, but he still can't forget it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Wait first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hanging a skull doesn't mean it's a Skull and Bones member. Many pirates also fly the skull flag when they are in action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The size of the fleet is not small, if the skeleton has such strength, it will never be as small as it was back then. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had reached out and grabbed Bear Stearns who was eager to try.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is everyone's responsibility to fight against pirates, but it is also necessary to figure out which side is responsible for it. In this vast sea, anything is possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only merchant ships traveling all over the world can visit pirates, even the navies of some countries occasionally change their clothes and come out to do side jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Island owner, there are fishermen in front of you, do you want to give them...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the red beard could finish speaking, the burly middle-aged man interrupted directly: \"Gage, put away your little thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know you feel uncomfortable, but those of us who are floating on the sea all day long can't help ourselves!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The debt of favor owed must be repaid after all. In any case, this matter must be done properly, otherwise you and I will never even think about going ashore alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, what do those fishermen have to grab? Except for a few small boats that cannot go to sea, there are only fishes that are found all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the sea chart, this should be the coast of the southeastern province of the Alpha Kingdom. I remember that this sea area is controlled by the Dalton family, their strength is not weak, don't make trouble here! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the middle-aged island owner glanced at the boathouse behind him from the corner of his eye, and then heaved a long sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, it was not because of his willingness to bring his little brothers out this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, a pirate leader was thinking about the \"debt of favor\", and if word got out, everyone in the circle would laugh out loud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the team, you can tell that the pirate leader who can buy such an industry is absolutely impossible to be a kind person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to force him to bow his head and disregard the \"business\" in his hand, and come all the way north from the central sea area to do one thing, is definitely not something ordinary people can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the content of the conversation between the two is too little. Based on these contents alone, Hudson can only deduce that they have taken on a hot job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the cabin that is dreaded by the pirate leader, there is an answer that can solve the mystery. But for the sake of safety, the cautious Hudson still leaned over to check.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the hidden magic is, it has its limit. Vaguely, he has already noticed that there are masters lurking in the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is extremely abnormal. The strong have their own arrogance, even if they go to be pirates, they must be the leader of the pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, a master like Hudson, who can't be recruited by a prince, why should he hang out with a pirate leader?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it's not the younger brother, then there is a high probability that it is the person who manipulates this band of pirates behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, Hudson would not be nosy as long as he was not involved, but the current situation is too sensitive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of pirates are going north. If such a force is entrenched in the open sea, not to mention threatening the safety of the kingdom's sea area, it will also have a great impact on his next plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, put a magic mark on them. Remember to keep it secret, so that no one will find out.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't make any sense to follow up directly. I don't know the destination of these pirates, who knows how long they will be sailing at sea, Hudson has no time to spend with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply put a flag and wait for them to stop before acting. In the depths of his heart, a new plan had already emerged from his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a sneaky action, but also pull the pirates as a cover, there is a high probability that it will not be a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't know the purpose of these guys, as long as their whereabouts are exposed and their things can't be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, it's time for the Dalton family to play. Fighting pirates is the duty of every nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't say hello, you run to other people's territory. If you don't respond, what will the Dalton family, the overlord of the southeast coast, do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking out the photo stone to record the activity information of the pirate ship, Hudson went straight to Port Hansen, and selected an unsteady officer to perform ecstasy magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pirates infested the southeast coast, and the opportunity to do meritorious deeds came, so you immediately took your men to arrest them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave a message...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the good deed is done, Hudson just walks away. He tried his best to fight against rampant pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter which group of people it is, as long as the two sides fight, they can stop if they want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the capital has sent another message, urging you to come over!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom reminded in a low voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the Mountain Territory has received many letters from the capital, all of which are asking Hudson to hurry over to preside over military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Reply to the capital and say that I will go there after I finish my work!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same excuse, he has used it many times. On the one hand, there are really many affairs in the territory, and on the other hand, it is a matter of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, he is the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's strategic mobilization, but there is no clear statement about the specific scope of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even this strategic mobilization headquarters is a temporary organization, and the administrative level has not yet been determined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is under the direct control of the king, or under the Ministry of Military Affairs, or only responsible to the noble council, there is no word on these.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also understood Caesar IV's approach. After all, it is easy to release power, but it is difficult to take it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the power of the Strategic Mobilization Headquarters is too great, once it comes to wartime, all of them will be transferred to the wartime economic system, and he, the king, may be emptied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have never happened in history. If Hudson was in the position of Caesar IV, he would not easily release his power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is necessary to strategically mobilize the headquarters to work, the authority of this temporary agency must be limited, and at least the necessary checks and balances must be retained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is knowing, but the **** decides the head. As the commander-in-chief of strategic mobilization, Hudson must fight for his rights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't know why, just go to work in the office, and you don't even think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the mobilization mechanism of the Alpha Kingdom is perfect, and it will not affect anything if he passes a few days earlier or a few days later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king was eager to urge him to take office, most likely because he was frightened by the international situation. The current strategic situation in the North Continent is really not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the reinforcements sent by the Alpha Kingdom set out, two countries had already started the battle to defend the capital. The tragic ending is almost doomed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the reinforcements are sent over immediately, it will not change the overall situation. Now let's see how long these two unlucky guys can last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the great nobles of the two countries have already arranged for backup and transferred most of the tribe. Staying and sticking to it now is just to give an explanation to the Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the laws formulated by the alliance, if you run away in the face of alien invasion, you will be deprived of the honor of the nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has already left them with nothing. If they lose even the last fig leaf - \"Glory of Nobility\", they will really have no way to get along in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of most people, the current defeat of the human race in the North Continent is only temporary. After winning the Continental War, the aliens still had to obediently spit out what they ate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For thousands of years, everyone has played like this. According to the rules of the game, the territory lost now can be regained in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of the magic crystal cannon pierced the sky and broke the silence of the sea. Looking at the warship that suddenly appeared in the distance, the middle-aged \"Island Owner\" said with a gloomy expression: \"Organize a counterattack immediately!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On someone else's territory, he wasn't ready to do anything. But the other party didn't give them a chance, and greeted them with magic crystal cannons as soon as they came up, even if they didn't want to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After firing a cannon, the young officer who was in a state of ecstasy also realized that the situation was not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own lonely warship actually ran out to fight with a group of pirates, this is not human affairs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gritting his teeth, the young officer immediately ordered: \"Send a signal for help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he couldn't help feeling rejoicing. Fortunately, during the process of losing their souls, they were fighting pirates. If they moved the merchant ships that came and went, there would be no way to explain it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, as long as you insist that the pirates did it first, and then give some gifts to manage it, the matter of attacking without authorization will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the premise is that he can support until reinforcements arrive. If he died in the hands of this group of unknown pirates, then everything would be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Man beard, what's going on?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't I ask you to be more cautious in your actions, why did you make such a noise? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An old cang's voice came from behind, and the middle-aged island owner, Man Beard, was frightened and hurried forward to explain:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, this is none of our business! As soon as the warship on the other side came up, it fired at us directly, without even giving us a chance to negotiate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know that there are some people who hate pirates and shout and kill when they meet. Maybe the commander on the other side is this kind of person. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, while nodding, the old man revealed a trace of disdainful contempt at the corner of his mouth, and said coldly: \"Trash!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't do such a small thing well, but you still claim to be all over the world. If someone wants to die, send them down quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wasting time to entangle here, when reinforcements arrive in a while, it will be difficult to silence them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said this on the lips, but he knew it very well in his heart. It is impossible to enter the village quietly, and this battle is bound to alarm the local snakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the pirate fleet depends on who it is compared with. Bullying ordinary businessmen is of course invincible. If you fight against some big nobles who have been engaged in maritime trade for many years, you may not be able to gain the upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that people can \"call friends and friends\". Once a fight starts, the sea power along the entire southeast coast will strangle them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, when such a bad situation happens, the pirates will choose to retreat. They only come out to rob money, but they have no interest in competing with a kingdom's navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is something big behind the scenes, you can also ask someone to mediate the conflict. They are all hanging out in the sea, how can there be no friction, and they can see each other in the future after giving each other some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the identities of the old people cannot be revealed, otherwise they will only die faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom may not go to war because of a pirate, but if it knows that a pirate force controlled by the Holy See has appeared at its door, there is absolutely no room for negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they said: no malicious intentions, even if they came to drop by, no one would believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson just pulled the reins, causing the situation to get out of control, forcing the Holy See and his party into an embarrassing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, since the whereabouts have been exposed. Otherwise, let's go back first, and go to Dulong Island after the limelight passes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the middle-aged island owner finished speaking, the old man slapped his mouth wide and warned: \"Man Beard, it seems that you have really improved a lot these years, and you dare to teach me how to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do your part well, and you don't need to worry about other things. I hope this is the first and last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise you will regret coming to this world! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the old man's terrifying methods, Man Beard, who woke up from his trance, nodded hastily in fright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At some point, there was a puddle of unknown liquid on the splint. Fortunately, the wind and waves at sea were strong enough, and the rising waves quickly covered it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you let the younger brothers know that your boss still has such a cowardly side, I'm afraid they will immediately lose their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing the lesson, the old man returned to the cabin with a few people behind him, as if nothing happened just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing a group of people leaving, Man Beard finally showed a resentful expression on his face, but this expression only disappeared for a moment, and then it was an expression of the rest of his life after a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life and death are all in the hands of the people. Even if he becomes a famous pirate leader, he is still just a dispensable **** in the eyes of the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No way, who made him a pirate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an identity, in the eyes of ordinary people, is extremely vicious; but in the eyes of real big shots, he is like an ant that can be crushed to death at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not that the Holy See does not have a fleet. They arranged for a group of them to accompany them. In addition to keeping their whereabouts secret, it is more because of this that going to Dulong Island requires a lot of cannon fodder to explore the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See's direct power is reluctant to lose, but it can only make them marginal characters unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Between the eyebrows, Man Beard showed a hint of ruthlessness. He has been working for the Holy See for so many years and still has no status. He has accumulated a lot of resentment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't known that the Holy See was too powerful, and he simply didn't have the ability to fight back, he would have retaliated a long time ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the legend of \"Dragon Island\", Man Beard's eyes lit up. If in this operation, Hu Holy See's harvest can be intercepted, maybe he can get rid of the current embarrassing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to lose this pirate group and reappear with a new identity. Now is the time of the Continental War, full of countless opportunities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing a country with a weak Holy See, waiting for an opportunity to join it, and obtaining an apparent noble status is more reliable than floating on the sea all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

I don't believe that a fleet can fly from the sky! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce ordered angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the door of his own house, he fought the enemy in a daze, and lost hundreds of navy officers and soldiers. In the end, he didn't even know the identity of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering such a big loss, how can the Dalton family still hang out at sea if they don't find out the enemy and kill them to make an example of them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the cause of the conflict, it is no longer important now, and there is no reason to fight pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, the trade in the northern waters is underdeveloped, and the strength of the pirates entrenched is mostly limited. These pirates who don't know the rules should come from the central and southern seas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates rely on a deep understanding of the sea area, and generally stay in the area where they are active, and rarely act across borders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This group of pirates suddenly went north, and it is understandable that our people did not find out in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the fleet suffered a lot in the battle, it also proved our control over the southeast coast from the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to find the traces of the enemy as soon as they broke in proves that the people below still put their heart into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for this naval battle, the enemy would be exposed. If these guys attack our ports or overseas islands, they will be a big threat! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Hudson's rise all the way, he, the sheriff of Wyton, was no longer in the fief, and went back to assist Earl Pierce in handling family affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half of the family needs for development, and the other half is forced out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce was worried that his young nephew would be instigated by outsiders to do stupid things, so he simply put him by his side to train him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that this decision is very correct. After handling government affairs for two years, Viscount Cayo's ability has also undergone earth-shaking changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alas, the situation is difficult!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outbreak of the continental war is already very unfavorable to the family, but now a mysterious pirate has emerged, threatening our maritime interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, let's clean up the pirates first. The direction of the continental war is not something we can decide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many places for pirates to hide on the southeast coast. As long as they don't leave, they will be able to find them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to prepare a generous gift, and ask Earl Hudson to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, you might as well go there yourself. Lower your posture a little, even if you can't invite people, let the dragon go to the sea for a lap. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the peaceful era, the Dalton family was the overlord of the southeastern province, and their overall strength was able to hold down the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Farming step by step, this advantage can last for decades, or even hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once it entered the war period, the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family, who were originally at a disadvantage, suddenly became special because of the existence of Hudson, a famous mainland general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change in the situation forced Earl Pierce to carefully handle the relationship between the two families. At the very least, you must ensure that you cannot leave it to the other party on the surface, for your own reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, it's just a group of pirates, there's no need to owe a favor, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo asked puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they suffered a lot in the previous sea, the sea power of the Dalton family was not seriously damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to wipe out a group of pirates, asking for help from a competitor and sending a favor in vain is not worthwhile no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kayo, you are still immature!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson is not only the dragon knight, but also the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's strategic mobilization. He will also become the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's army in the future, and may even command the armies of various countries in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an identity is no longer something the family can suppress. Even if we want to suppress it, we can't find a suitable entry point, including our allies, who will not support us to take action now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more difficult the situation in the North Continent is, the more special Hudson's status becomes. All major forces in the kingdom are waiting for him to command the army at this moment, and turn the tide at the critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can't go against the general trend and do things like praying man's arms to block the traffic. Since you can't suppress it, then find a way to make friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is a rising aristocrat after all, and the Earl of Hudson is even smarter, a nouveau riche who is not successful or rampant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neither the royal family nor the major forces in the country will see him dominating the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it crosses the line, even if it is a war, everyone needs to use him, and if he can endure the outbreak, he will settle accounts after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the more beautiful Hudson is now, the easier it will be to fall into public criticism after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has never been a lack of similar negative cases in history. Many legendary heroes have been persecuted, and they are essentially politically immature, putting themselves in a dangerous situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have seen Earl Hudson's political skills. It was impossible for him not to see such an obvious thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also the best choice for him to maintain the pattern of the two powers in the southeastern province. One step further, and the king would not be able to sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are gains in the war, the expansion of the Koslow family cannot be in the southeastern province. In this regard, all major families in the country are the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom has no restrictions on big nobles, I am afraid that there are big families across provinces and counties everywhere. Where is there room for small and medium nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hudson is asked to take action. In addition to deliberately giving a favor, another reason is that the origin of this group of pirates is unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case there is a plan by a certain big force behind it, there can be one more person to share the hatred. After all, Dragon Knight's sense of existence is much stronger than ours. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Earl Pierce's explanation, Viscount Cayo blushed. He never expected that such a seemingly ordinary invitation would hide so many things behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the Koslow family and the Dalton family, who are in the southeastern province, compete for a while and cooperate for a while, making people puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sorting it out like this, everything is explained. When neither of the two major forces has the ability to swallow the other in one gulp, compromise in the struggle becomes an inevitable choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Omega, as one of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, unfortunately stood in the way of the orc army and became the first country to start the defense of the capital since the outbreak of the Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory fell so quickly, it is not the nobles of the Principality of Omega who are waste. In fact, the aristocrats who can come out to open up a foundation are all the elites of this era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small countries are superimposed on emerging immigrant countries. The combination of two objective factors determines the tragic lifeline of the Principality of Omega.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle to defend the capital started early, because the country is flat and the only strong city defense fortress is the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development time is too short. There are not even a few cities in the entire principality, and the noble castles are all under construction, so there is no condition to stick to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no sign in advance, and no one knew that the mainland war would break out so suddenly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught off guard, he was brought into the war, which put a lot of pressure on the Principality of Omega.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personally inspecting the defenses on the city wall, Baird I, who was physically and mentally exhausted, sighed secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he took the throne, he hasn't had a good day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he was busy preparing for the establishment of the government to organize immigration, and then he got up early and took the people to open up wasteland and start a business. Unexpectedly, just as the principality was on the right track, the orc army came to kill it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had known that it would be so sad to be a king, he would have stayed in his hometown and been a rice bug.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no medicine for regret in the world. Now is the time of race war, and he cannot be allowed to shrink back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When will reinforcements from various countries arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baird I asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Omega has turned all its citizens into soldiers, as long as they are citizens who can carry a knife, they have been incorporated into the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is still a dream to stop the orc army with this little power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The army of the Seven Nations Alliance has already begun to mobilize, but considering that the orcs may intercept them halfway, we can only act together after the reinforcements from various countries in the mainland gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the six countries jointly initiated a proposal to the Alliance, which is currently being discussed in the Human Race Alliance Parliament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Privately, the seven-nation alliance has also communicated with various countries. The Kingdom of Frankish promised to send 40,000 troops, and the Kingdom of Libya promised to send 35,000 troops...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has promised to send the largest number of troops, and plans to send an army of 10,000 people to each of our seven countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the reinforcements promised by the mainland countries is as high as more than 400,000. Coupled with the military power of the Seven Nations Alliance, theoretically speaking, it should be possible to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these are all theoretical. In actual practice, the speed of all countries is very slow, including the Alpha Kingdom, which has always been efficient, and the response speed is not generally slow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides the Alpha Kingdom, the major human nations on the mainland have all been involved in the war. Even if they are willing to send reinforcements, they probably won't be elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the overall situation, the principality is still not optimistic! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Bathory said in a deep voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such diplomatic results are not satisfactory. But there is no way, people are selfish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone promised to send troops, it is for the righteousness of the human race, but the prerequisite is to take care of yourself first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not only not optimistic, it is clearly not leaving us a way to survive!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no reinforcements, it is only a matter of time before the capital falls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now able to defend, that is because the orcs did not attack aggressively, they wanted to win with the least cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have been blocked, and the food reserves in the city can last up to three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the food runs out, even if the enemy does not attack, we will collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other countries are fine. For their hegemony, it is natural to abandon us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's the matter with the Alpha Kingdom? It's been so procrastinating and standing still. Don't they understand that after the end of our Seven Kingdoms, they will be the next unlucky one? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Military Affairs Jeverson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to defend the capital, they were forced to take measures to fortify the walls and clear the country, and gathered all the troops from the whole country. The influx of a large number of people directly led to the rapid consumption of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the supply is cut off, the food in the city is one grain, and one grain is missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They didn't consider this issue before, that's because they didn't think they could last three months under the full attack of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs slowed down their offensive intensity, and the food problem, which was not considered at first, has now become the source of the crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I can answer this question for you, and it can be summed up in two words—Qianliang!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has not yet come out of the last war, even if they want to send a large-scale army, they still cannot afford the money and food for the expedition to the grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the life and death of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland has nothing to do with them. Maybe they are still cultivating enemies for themselves if they work hard to rescue them. It is better to let us and the orcs consume.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the enemies they need to consider are not only orcs, but also ancient survivors and elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing in their position, maybe letting the orcs destroy us and fighting the orcs at the gate of our house is the best choice! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Cameron said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the head of the family knows that firewood, rice, oil and salt are expensive. The Continental War broke out only two months ago, and the Principality of Omega is about to run out of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, which has fought for several years in a row, can imagine the economic situation. Decades of accumulation have been wiped out, and a whole lot of debt is owed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another million-army expedition, I am afraid that before defeating the orcs, the Alpha Kingdom will be dragged down by the huge consumption of logistics supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to know that the seven grassland countries are currently self-sufficient, and it is still difficult to provide logistics for the army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When all countries send troops to reinforce, they must bring their own food and supplies. At most, they organize manpower to help transport them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't need to be too pessimistic. In view of the special situation we are facing, the Human Race Alliance Council specially approved: We can evacuate in an orderly manner and resist steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, an orderly evacuation exists only in theory. Once they leave the protection of the city, they will be sent to the orc army to be slaughtered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now protect the city first, and after two or three months, organize a breakout on the grounds of running out of food, which is an explanation to all parties. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Batory said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerging combined countries lack sufficient centripetal force. But no matter what, it is still a country, and only in this country can they occupy a high position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you choose to evacuate, no one knows when you will be able to take back your homeland. Maybe it's after the continental war, or maybe it's the Lifetime series.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the heated discussions among the ministers, Baird I just couldn't stop sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Omega, which seems to have a sound system, is essentially a grassroots team that has just been established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the people present are from prominent backgrounds, even if the principality is destroyed, they can still go back to be rice worms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power invested in the principality is only a small part of the family behind it, even if it fails, it will not hurt its vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is passed on for several generations and the interests are locked in the principality, it will definitely be a different scene at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs, send people to communicate with the Alpha Kingdom and try to get reinforcements as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of Seven Nations also needs to urge it. Even if they dare not send troops to rescue, they can make some noise to cover our breakout! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Baird I turned and left with a wave of his sleeves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that once he withdrew from the Principality of Omega, his role as king would be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is restored in the future, nothing will happen to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the attitude of the officials, it can be seen that the relationship between the monarch and his ministers is purely patchwork, and there is no loyalty at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little prestige of the monarch that was painstakingly managed has long since disappeared with the continuous defeat of the war.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Instead of staying to fight for the uncertain Pope, it is better to take the throne passed down from generation to generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he said he wanted to restore the glory of the Holy See, in fact Pius VII knew better than anyone that the Holy See could not return to the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think of the request for help from the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII frowned and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See is not his own Holy See. If you want to send troops to rescue, you must get the support of the major factions within the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to achieve this. The son of the pope is the king, and the sons of the faction leaders are also big lords, and then there may be small and medium lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the Kingdom of Light is a replica of the Holy See. All are tailor-made positions, which are almost impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aftereffect is the fighting power of the Kingdom of Light, which may have stretched a little bit. There are too many children of the second and third generations, and the will to work hard is not so strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, they also have their own advantages, and the resources invested by their parents are more generous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the data on paper, the Kingdom of Light ranks first among the Seven Kingdoms of the Grasslands in terms of population, economy, army, and number of masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Kingdom of Light among the Seven Prairie Kingdoms is an important part of our layout in the Northern Continent. It cannot be easily abandoned unless it is absolutely necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to spread the glory of the Lord of Dawn to the mainland again, we must urge the Terran Alliance to take immediate action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the parliament fails to pass, let the Kingdom of Light temporarily give up most of its territory and choose dangerous areas to hold on to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an elite army to help them keep at least one stronghold, and after the victory in the continental war, they will join forces with other countries to help them regain their lost ground. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lord Sauron said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical private use of public equipment, but no one expressed objection. After all, this is not the first time a similar operation has happened. The previous large-scale support for the Kingdom of Light was also paid by the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to many joint-stock countries, the Holy See is a proper private enterprise. There is only the Lord of Dawn as the boss, and everyone present is just senior wage earners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Lord of Dawn has not shown up for many years, many people have regarded the Holy See as their own private property, but they still have to consider the issue of faith and cannot truly turn religion into their home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no problem sending troops, but the orcs are a group of lunatics, who just ended a war and jumped out so impatiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to help the Kingdom of Light defend a stronghold, you must not only consider military issues, but more importantly, logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only large port on the prairie is currently under the control of the Farland Kingdom. If we want to transport materials there, the closest route is to transfer there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To keep the Kingdom of Light, this port must also be kept. This requires the joint efforts of all countries, and it is too difficult for our family alone! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Gu Lei's analysis, everyone's faces were ugly. It can be seen from the map that keeping the logistics line is actually more troublesome than keeping the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The importance of large ports is self-evident. In the last war, all countries in the mainland used this port to transport strategic materials and completed the strategic strike against the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After suffering a loss, it is impossible for the orc not to learn a lesson. As long as those in power are not stupid, they will try their best to take this port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to keep the port, a **** battle is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the scene is accidentally magnified and the main force of the orc army is attracted, then the Alpha Kingdom will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of a bright kingdom, whether it is worth investing so many resources or not, everyone weighed in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send 50,000 reinforcements first to help the Kingdom of Light stabilize people's hearts. Before the war is over, send as much supplies as possible to the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what you choose in the end, the battle to defend the Kingdom of Light must be fought. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is no longer the era when the Holy See dominates everything, and they must abide by the rules of the game prevailing on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is undoubtedly the best choice to defend a stronghold, preserve the legal authority of the Kingdom of Light, and lay the foundation for the later counterattack to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing the foundation organization government-in-exile, waiting for the post-war Terran Alliance to support the restoration is also an option, but this must be recognized by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The criteria for recognition are very simple: look at the strength of resistance during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for a newly established country like the Kingdom of Light, it is even more necessary to perform well at this time. If you don't show an impressive record, you won't be able to convince the public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes were staged across the continent at the same time. The mainland dignitaries who have the spare capacity to provide support are weighing whether to continue to invest in the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the countries threatened by the elves and the ancient survivors are much more miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the mainland nobles belong to one family, they have been independent for too long after all, and the blood relationship is almost zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the same family, there is still a little love left, far less close than the sons, grandsons, and brothers who have just been separated from the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no affection, purely from the perspective of interests, everyone seems to have not seen their appeal letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the verbal promise to send troops to aid, there is no real action at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure gradually spread to the countries of the Northern Continent through the Human Race Alliance Parliament. The central and southern countries can ignore it, but their neighbors cannot sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the frontline countries collapse, and the flames of war will soon be on their own heads, and no one can be alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that the Terran Alliance could not be counted on, all countries turned their attention to the Alpha Kingdom, waiting for the leader of the Northern Continent to come up with a plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the core members of the Kingdom's military, Hudson also obtained first-hand information. Even if he was far away from the royal capital, he could still feel the anguish of the princes and ministers at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To send troops or not to send troops is completely a dilemma. Even if they had made a wait-and-see decision before, due to the current situation and international pressure, they had to make a new choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that no meeting was held to discuss it again is enough to prove that the high-level leaders of the kingdom are responsible, and they have endured the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it, so Hudson will not come out to take responsibility. In the case of uncertain future development, any decision may be wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the results of the previous aristocratic meeting as the decision, and everyone can bear it together if there is a problem. If you change your decision without authorization, any problems that arise will be your own responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Habitually destroying the documents, Hudson continued to be busy with things in the territory like a normal person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, Viscount Cayo is visiting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom's voice sounded in his ears, and Hudson smiled slightly and said, \"Please ask him to rest in the living room, and I'll be there soon.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that the previous plan had worked. I just don't know the result of the naval battle, who will win and who will lose in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kayo, long time no see!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson greeted with enthusiasm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is actually not much communication between the two. Even if he filed a criminal complaint with Governor Pierce, it was out of \"good intentions\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's true that I haven't seen you for a while. Your Excellency the Earl is still so handsome, which is really enviable.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo pretended to be emotional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His perception of Hudson is very complicated. It has gone through several stages, first contempt, then close attention, then hatred, and now more can only look up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are a very busy person right now. Your Excellency the governor has entrusted you with handling all the government affairs in the province. Didn't you happen to pass by this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said half-jokingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed a lot of government affairs in the southeast province, but most of them are meaningless repetitions and trivialities. The only thing to worry about is the blood moon defense line under construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the nobles in other regions, who are flexible, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom prefer to admit death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was determined that the Kingdom of Hesse threatened the security of the southeastern province. Even if the continental war broke out, the construction of the defense line did not stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the only one who dares to make such willful troubles is the wealthy family in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally the wealthiest province in the kingdom, and a large magic crystal mine was added not long ago. Everyone has the capital to prepare for the war and construct it at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, building the blood moon defense line is the best cover for the magic crystal mine. There are a large number of labor transfers every day, and it is difficult to find abnormalities without statistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc slaves contributed by Hudson have now been erased from the official data. The reasons given on the surface are: acclimatization, plague, and project collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, one by one entered the mine and unlocked new jobs. Unless the magic crystal mine loses its mining value, it will be difficult for them to appear in the sight of the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I am here to ask for your help. A group of mysterious pirates suddenly appeared on the southeast coast and fought a battle with the family's navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, we have started to search the sea, and roughly locked the enemy's position in the waters of Dulong Island. Presumably the Earl has also heard of the rumors left here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to pull out this cancerous tumor and restore the cleanliness of the southeast coast, please help the Earl! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Viscount Cayo's voice fell, Hudson fell into deep thought. The legend of \"Dragon Island\" is well-known in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to ancient legend, this place is the exile place where the ancient gods imprisoned the evil dragon. The island is full of poisonous insects and ferocious beasts, and if you are not careful, you will lose your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are rumors that this place is an altar of gods. Affected by the Great War of the Ancients, it fell into disuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also legends that this place is a treasure trove, where treasures of an incomparably rich country are buried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people even say that this is connected to the entrance of the abyss, and anyone who gets close to it will suffer various misfortunes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of messy stories, and the truth can no longer be verified, but the probability of accidents after the ship enters this sea area is indeed very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looked at Viscount Cayo for a while, but couldn't find any fake elements, Hudson smiled slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pirate incident was all created by him. The enemy's destination was Dulong Island, and no one knew it beforehand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In such a short period of time, it should be impossible for the Dalton family to set a trap with their tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many dragon knights who were designed to be murdered on the mainland, but there are really not many, and they are all conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to plot against people, but it is not so simple to plot against a holy dragon. These extraordinary creatures have a very sensitive sense of danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are traps, it's useless. Master Hudson has no love for mysterious treasures and the like.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I found out by myself, maybe I will go to investigate. The invitations of other people are all respectful and insensitive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greed is the original sin. Hudson doesn't believe that there is a pie from the sky, and it just happens to fall on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a real treasure, it is the icing on the cake for him. Wealth can be obtained from wars. Wealth accumulated in the last war was consumed. A new round of war is coming soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of secret techniques and knowledge inheritance, he has also collected a lot one after another. Although many of them are taken in one stroke, it is enough to broaden your horizons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Together in the southeastern province, it is impossible for the Dalton family not to know that the cautious Master Hudson never teamed up with others to hunt for treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not entering the underground palace or secret realm, just wandering outside, wanting to ambush a dragon knight is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, when fighting back against the orcs, the Terran Alliance organized a team of experts to ambush Maxim, and they all let him slip away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although only two or three years have passed, Maxim's strength is not what it used to be. Encountering enemies with the same lineup, even if they can't win, they won't be as embarrassed as they were back then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let go of the idol burden of the dragon, learn Bear Stearns' sap style of play, and even follow the team to complete the counter-kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the current situation is not a good time to attack him. If you really want to do black hands, you should also choose after the end of the mainland war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other races, Hudson thinks that he, a five-hearted young man, is not so capable of attracting hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Viscount Cayo, everyone is responsible for combating pirates. Since these pirates have appeared on the southeast coast, they are our common enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the sea area of ​​the North Continent is full of reefs, and there are often monsters haunting it. If you are not familiar with sea routes, accidents are easy to happen to ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are these pirates who are cooked but not raw, what are they doing here?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is an accident and you want to move your old nest to avoid the limelight, you should keep a low profile, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked knowingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pirates were very low-key, and even the fishermen didn't bother to pay attention. But with him as the mastermind behind the scenes, the pirates couldn't keep a low profile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blood on each other, and dare not reveal their identities to negotiate peace, so they can only fight on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We are also investigating this matter. The first thing they found was a patrol warship. It should be that there was a conflict during the interrogation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the reinforcements arrived on the battlefield, the warship had already sunk into the sea. Chased and fought at sea, and had to stop because night fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The waters of Duron Island are often shrouded in fog, and if you are not careful, you will get lost. It is not easy to find their foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, we can only ask Your Excellency the Earl to take action! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo explained sincerely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous content is all true. The Dalton family is now in a state of confusion. They don't know how this outside pirates dare to attack their own warships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for the conflict is also pure speculation. After all, the parties involved have already met with the Lord of Dawn, and they want to investigate unless the pirates are caught alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dulong Island in the back is filled with clouds and mist, it is not suitable to find the enemy's foothold, it is purely an excuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the extraordinary world, as long as the Dalton family is willing, they are fully capable of clearing the fog in an area in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trouble is a little troublesome, but compared to owe him a favor, it is obviously more economical to be a little troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an obvious show of favor, if you still can't see it, Hudson can stop messing around in the political arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War breaks out again and everything is different. He, the sure commander in chief, already possesses high value in the eyes of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family is not the first family to come here deliberately to seek relationships, and it won't be the last family either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action is taken, it is only because a suitable entry point has not been found. If there is an opportunity, everyone hopes to establish a good relationship with the commander-in-chief in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect to get much attention, at least to avoid being deliberately targeted on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you, the lord of Meng Yizhi, Haiyue who loves you forever\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson took Kayo directly on the road and flew directly to Hansen Port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the naval fleet gathered by the Dalton family, Hudson was almost drooling with envy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two first-class battleships (more than 3,000 tons), five second-class battleships (more than 2,000 tons), thirteen third-class battleships (more than 1,000 tons), and more than 30 auxiliary warships of various types ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the lineup, you can see that the Dalton family suffered a lot in the previous naval battle. They estimated that all the warships that could be mobilized nearby were dispatched, obviously not planning to leave a way for the pirates to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no sympathy for the pirates. Those who can come out to do this kind of moneyless business have their hands full of sin, and they will all be pulled out and hacked without any injustice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kayo, let your people go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how envious you are, you can't show it. If someone treats her as a bumpkin, it will hurt others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the size of the fleet, the navy does not have a high status in the Dalton family, or in other words, the status of most countries in the continent of Aslant is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roots are all on the mainland, no matter how powerful the naval fleet is, there is no way to land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most nobles do not attach importance to the development of the navy. The Dalton family can come up with such a lineup, mainly because of the needs of maritime trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, it is not difficult to create such a fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to throw money into it, the ship can be built in two or three years; the trouble is that there are no officers and soldiers who can control the warship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group of sailors obtained from the royal family can only be said to be able to drive a warship, and the overall quality is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that for a long time to come, the naval fleet of the Mountain Territory will be just a show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the strength of the ship and guns, bullying a small group of pirates, it is estimated that there will be no problem. It would be a tragedy to meet the regular army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pale-faced Kayo nodded at Hudson, and said to the middle-aged man in a daze, \"Uncle Byron, order the fleet to set sail!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, he vomited on the boat. Obviously, the dragon mount is not so easy to rub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo, who received the ticket, was looking for excitement the whole time. With this unforgettable journey, it is estimated that he will never want to come again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim has a temper. Not everyone can enjoy the treatment of the dragon knight, unless the money is added in place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no time to talk about the price, so I went straight to the road, and the treatment was not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally Hudson wanted to fight for Kayo, but later, considering that talking about money would hurt his feelings, he simply let him choose to ride a griffin or a dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young Viscount Cayo unfortunately chose the latter. Go back and have a bragging conversation with your friends, but the price you pay is a bit high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few episodes will not affect this trip. After feeling the charm of the sea on the splint, Hudson decisively went to the cabin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to command the fleet across the four seas, but the wind and waves were too big to withstand the toss, so the plan had to be cancelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in a hurry, the magic circle has been fully driven, and there is no time to calculate the specific sailing speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just feeling it, Hudson knew that the overall performance of his warship that was still on the berth had fallen behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The times are advancing and technology is iterating. Hudson suddenly understood why the people of the Holy See traded technology so readily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is clear that he is bullying the poor and white of the mountain leader. After he completes the initial primitive accumulation, the original advanced technology has become a backward technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, after so many years, Hudson still hasn't been able to digest the technology he got back then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, all shipbuilding technical materials are silent in the warehouse, and no one cares about them. Even after getting the Berkshire Shipyard, there is still no way to digest it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of feudal lords, the population flow was very small, and there were a lot of technical terms and materials with dialect characteristics, which no one in the mountainous land could understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't bought the Berkshire Shipyard, maybe in a desperate situation, Hudson might really go to the Holy See's shipyard to arrest people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not needed now. It will take time for the mountainous land to digest the Berkshire Shipyard at this moment. There is no need to rush to decipher these shipbuilding materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still a huge gap between the shipbuilding concepts of the Aslant Continent. With the special factor of magic added, it is difficult for everyone to reach a consensus on technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there is no science here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality of the shipbuilding concept is good or bad. The early construction only accounts for a small part, and the supporting facilities such as the magic circle and magic crystal cannon are the decisive factors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various seemingly unreasonable and unscientific layouts, combined with extraordinary factors, everything can become logical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Join if you don't know, Hudson is not a naval engineer, so there is no need to die on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Man Beard, what the **** are you doing? Why haven't you been able to find Dulong Island after traveling through the fog for so long?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man in sacrificial robes reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no such thing as a coastline in the continent of Aslant, everyone still defaults to the fact that the sea area close to it is the sphere of influence of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island waters, the nearest country is the Alpha Kingdom, which is naturally regarded by the Alpha people as their own sphere of influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because this place lacks economic benefits and ships are easy to get lost in it, it is regarded as an ominous place, and the Alpha Kingdom doesn't care about Duron Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they came here secretly, no one would know what they wanted to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they had a fight with the Dalton family's navy earlier, exposing themselves. If you don't finish things quickly and leave, it won't be so easy for them to leave when the other party reacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the sea area of ​​Dulong Island is also known as the Misty Sea Area. It is said that the area covered by clouds and mist is hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. The entire area is only one island, and there is no reference coordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here, the line of sight of ordinary people is less than 100 meters. Looking around, everything is gray.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a ship enters this sea area, it is most likely to lose its way. Whether you can reach the legendary Poison Dragon Island depends entirely on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, I entered this place by mistake and was able to leave safely, thanks to the blessing of the Lord of Dawn! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man Beard hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prove that he did his best, he still held the chart while speaking, and pointed to his hair that was about to be caught bald.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elder priest was about to get angry, but was stopped by a middle-aged knight behind him. In this special place, the pirates in front of him are more reliable than their group of masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they accidentally get lost here, even if they are the top powerhouses in the mainland, they may also lose their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Josip. As one of the top ten dangerous places, if Dulong Island is so easy to find, it won't have such a big name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearded, continue to search according to your experience. After seven days, if we haven't found Dulong Island, we will leave this sea area first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jelacic said kindly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this scene fell into Man Beard's eyes, but it was even more terrifying than the reprimand given to sacrifice to the old man just now. At least the former is still a normal person, while the latter is purely a lunatic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ascetic monks of the Holy See, in the eyes of ordinary people, are a group of pious, morally noble, modest, morally perfect people who hate evil like hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with a bearded beard mixed with the Holy See, he knows very well that all this is an illusion. Ascetic monks are so noble, and the Holy See does not hide so much dirt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the belief is devout, and everything else is fiction. Most of the ascetic monks are lunatics, dedicating everything in their lives to the gods, and their minds are full of the glory of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to talk now, that's because he is one of the few people on the mainland who entered Dulong Island and was able to come out alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the task cannot be completed, the opponent will turn his face in the next second. In the eyes of these lunatics, the gods are the biggest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates who do not do their job well have no value at all, and surviving is a blasphemy against the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe from participating in this operation, in the eyes of this group of lunatics, their gang of pirates are already dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lords, please rest assured, I will definitely find Dulong Island!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man Beard hurriedly assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has already started to scold his mother. Why hasn't the Dalton family arrived yet? Without external force to join, he can't make a comeback!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed a large number of pirates, but most of these people are just strong men with a little force, and they are still a group of rabble in essence. It's okay to bully ordinary people, but it's not worth mentioning in front of extraordinary power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are people from the Holy See on every ship, nominally for the convenience of living, but in fact they are secretly watching to prevent him from playing tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Man Beard said again: \"My lords, the fog obscures the view too much, and the area of ​​Dulong Island is not big, so we might not be able to spot it if we pass by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a magician can take action to disperse the fog near the fleet, it will definitely be of great help to the next search for Dulong Island! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sincere face, no problems can be seen. It also sounds realistic to let the magician take action to disperse the thick fog covering the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that there are no magicians among the pirates, and the only way to get rid is to rely on the Holy See and his party. Consuming a lot of mana in such a place is also a dangerous thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jeracic agreed too readily, and it was too late for Bishop Josip to stop him. He hesitated for a moment, but finally nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the magicians in the team don't make a move, they are confident in suppressing this group of pirates. Even if the pirate leader in front of him really has calculations, he is confident that he can suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the fog, Hudson and his party stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respect Earl Hudson, the foggy area ahead is the famous sea area of ​​Duron Island, we also call him the foggy area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fog on the outside is not too big, and the visibility becomes lower as you go inside, making it impossible to distinguish the direction at all. Once you go deep into it, it is difficult to find your way back, and ships go missing here every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a rare sea storm in decades can blow away the fog and reveal the true face of this sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this mysterious sea area, the kingdom also organized manpower to explore, and even landed on the legendary Poison Dragon Island, but the island is too dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the expedition team of 300 people, only five people survived in the end. Those who survived seemed to have experienced great terror, and they kept silent about the affairs on the island. We did not have detailed information in our hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is uncertain whether the pirates who entered this sea area entered it by mistake, or went in specifically to find the legendary treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island is too dangerous, even if you go deep into it, you may not be able to meet the pirates face to face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Near the misty sea area, only the route in this direction has been opened up. The other areas are all unfamiliar sea areas, full of unknown risks. If they can survive, there is a high probability that they will return from this vicinity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether they entered by mistake or want to go in to hunt for treasure, we just need to block them here! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron explained with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chasing murderers in the vast ocean requires skill. If you foolishly chase after the enemy's butt, you don't know how you will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many risks in unfamiliar routes, uncertain storms, sea tribes who hate humans, powerful monsters, special terrain...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what kind of situation is encountered, the fleet may suffer heavy losses, or even the entire army will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Well, then wait first...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson finished speaking, three ships with strange paintings in the distance appeared in his sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was several miles away, he could feel an evil aura rushing toward his face, as if it came from the abyss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron on the side even exclaimed: \"Ghost ship!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three ghost ships are heading towards us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oops, we're being targeted!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send the order down, and everyone is ready to fight immediately. Reload all the magic crystal cannons, aim at the three ghost ships, and start shelling as soon as they come into range! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has also heard of the infamous \"ghost ship\". Those who live at sea are most afraid of encountering these monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that all the people on the \"ghost ship\" are ghosts, and some of them still retain some memories of their lives. Even though they have been dead for many years, these guys still think they are still alive, and they often come out to rob business travellers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encounter is a **** battle. Ordinary physical attacks are not very lethal to these monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only extraordinary powers such as knights and magicians can truly kill these ghosts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trouble is that after these ghosts are killed, they will be resurrected on the ship soon. Only by destroying the ghost ship itself can they be eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newborn ghost ship is similar to an ordinary ship, and it is not difficult to destroy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, ghost ships and ghosts can also grow, as long as they are killed, they can continue to grow stronger. Some powerful ghost ships, even the army will feel tricky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, the best choice when encountering a ghost ship is to fire immediately. If you are lucky, the magic crystal cannon will deter them, and these guys will leave on their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you get close to the **** battle mode, you will often suffer heavy losses. As far as their strength allows, the navies of the major forces will try their best to encircle and suppress the ghost ship when they encounter it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Byron, are these three ghost ships very powerful?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo asked with a pale face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, he suffered a lot. First, he was tossed to the point of vomiting by Maxim's prank, and then he was turbulent by the wind and waves at sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Byron arranged for a priest to treat him, but was rejected by Viscount Cayo, who took his life seriously, and only took a magic potion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ghost ships usually appear alone, rarely in groups, and they all appear at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to come out to rob during the day means that the ghosts on the ship have grown to the point where they can ignore the damage of sunlight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three ghost ships act together, which means that the ghosts on board have good wisdom, or they have restored many memories of their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time we wiped out a ghost ship that appeared during the day was thirty years ago. We lost three warships and more than 800 soldiers, including an earth knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three ghost ships appear together during the day, the most recent ones being a hundred years ago. Let us bump into each other today, and I am afraid that a fierce battle will be inevitable in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Byron suddenly said: \"Earl Hudson, you are the most powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, the fight will start, and the matter of destroying the ghost ship is up to you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he was secretly admiring Earl Pierce's foresight and foresight, and he helped to pull in reinforcements in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Hudson, a powerful thug, when encountering these things, his first reaction would be to order to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It counts as much as you can run, and experience tells him that he must never fight head-on with a ghost ship whose strength is unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountering this group of monsters, no matter how many ordinary soldiers there are, it doesn't make any sense. Only real masters can eliminate these weird guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I will find a chance to make a move!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he already doubted that he was the protagonist. Originally, I just came out to make soy sauce, and by the way increased my experience in naval battles, and encountered a ghost ship of this level.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The performance of these three ghost ships is also too flexible, completely different from what is recorded in the data.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling that the ghost ship can evolve by killing, Hudson immediately realized the seriousness of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three ghost ships in front of me have obviously evolved more than once, and they may be the legendary high-level ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to determine the rank of the ghost ship, the easiest way to judge is to look at the strength of the ghost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the division of ghost ships in the human world, the level of strength of the ghost king on board is the level of ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the number of ghosts under his command, there is no uniform standard, it may be dozens to thousands, and the strength is lower than that of the ghost king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the two sides approached, Hudson had already taken off in the dragon. Maxim, who was awakened from his sleep, entertained him with a mouthful of dragon flame without saying a word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's the memory of the ghosts, or the ghosts' spiritual intelligence is high. After the discovery of the dragon, it immediately caused panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the pirate leader of the \"Ghost King\", while comforting his younger brother, he manipulated the ghost ship to avoid attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But everything was in vain. Under the baptism of flames, countless ghosts were reduced to ashes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to be happy, the next scene shocked everyone, the dead ghost was directly resurrected on the spot at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The legends are true, the ghost on the ship can come back from the dead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson was relieved that the ghost ship was not unscathed, and the splint hit by Maxim directly had a large hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resurrected ghost is also a little weaker than before. The key is that the ghost king's strength was also forced out by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eighth-level ghost king, this level of ghost ship, the weakest ghost on it has third-level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most elite navy in the mainland is mostly ordinary people. Once the ghosts enter the ship, it will be a massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you want to let these ghosts come over and cheat the Dalton family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Hudson dismissed the idea. If the water is released at this moment, the entire fleet may be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of ghosts rushed into the ship for close combat, and ordinary soldiers had no resistance at all. Facing such an immortal enemy, the masters accompanying the army could not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal cannon can pose a threat to the ghost ship, so it must hit the opponent first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, try the strength of these broken ships first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson himself joined the battle. Opportunities to practice like this are rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a level 5 magician capable of instant casting, his role on the battlefield is no less than that of a magician.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opponents at the same level, no one can survive a round in the hands of Hudson. Even stronger opponents may be taken away by a wave if they are not prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, as the coach of the army, he must sit in the rear to lead the overall situation, and there is no chance for Hudson to perform. If he, the coach, is really needed to take action in person, it means that it is time for life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Meteor Fire Rain\", \"Hellfire\", \"Fire Dancing World\"...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of fire-type magic descended from the sky on the ghost ship, a perfect visual feast. The uninformed onlookers thought it was Maxim who was going crazy, and ordered to sigh the power of the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dragon Rider!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, hurry up and fight back! Rush into the opponent's fleet and engage in close combat with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second and third, let's take the masters up to deal with the dragon knight, I want to slay the dragon today! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ghost King roared and ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, three eighth-level ghost kings and dozens of sixth- and seventh-level ghosts on board surrounded Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Maxim's face turned green with anger. Someone who dared to shout \"slaying the dragon\" in front of him simply ignored him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon language magic flew around for a while, and many ghosts who wanted to squeeze the persimmons had just floated near the Hudson, and they were slapped back and reborn by the claws that suddenly appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing Xiong's eyes, looking at the sky full of A Piao, Bear Stearns became more playful. He grabbed a few of them casually, locked them in his paws, and looked at them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if meeting a toy bear cub, not only did he not continue to shoot, but instead said: \"Hudson, these guys are so fun, they are so light and weightless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, we will take them back and raise them as pets. In normal times, you can still collect tickets for people to visit, which should be a good harvest. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Childlike innocence is still there, but it is different. It is estimated that Bear Stearns dared to think about raising ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just don't know why, Hudson suddenly felt that this proposal could be tried. If you can really control these three ghost ships, not to mention that you can travel all over the world, at least when you encounter threats at sea, you can make the enemy unable to eat and walk around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then try it first, whether you can sign a slave contract with these ghosts. If you can enslave them, then keep it first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the discussion of one person and one bear, Maxim rolled his eyes in the battle, but he didn't object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, he is not a peaceful dragon. He also has a lot of interest in enslaving ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strengthening strength is second, the key is fun. Creatures like ghosts are very rare in the material plane.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Growing up so big, this is the first time he has seen this kind of creature that treats itself as a human being, but also likes to float around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three unscrupulous guys are planning how to enslave these ghosts, and the strength of attacking the ghost ship is much smaller than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a pain for the fleet below. Dealing with floating, immortal creatures like ghosts is obviously not their specialty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson dragged all the high-level ghosts, they were still mentally broken by the floating ghosts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the screams, Hudson remembered his allies. He hastily said, \"Maxim should stop wasting time with these guys, attack the ghost ship directly, and expel them away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, look for opportunities to catch more ghosts, every ship must have one, and it is best to catch a ghost king back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Expulsion\" is not elimination, it is obvious that he is fascinated by the ghost ship. There are very few cases of ghost ships being controlled by humans, but not all of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A powerful Lich King in ancient times once formed a ghost fleet, and the fleet disappeared wherever he went.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various ethnic organizations have repeatedly encircled and suppressed, all of which ended in failure. At one time, the ocean trade was almost cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe life was too comfortable, but in the end, this lifeless Lich King went to Dragon Island to steal corpses to refine bone dragons, which attracted the pursuit of dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Led by the three dragon kings, hundreds of adult dragons hunted down the Lich King for more than ten years before killing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All ethnic groups in the mainland who suffered a loss have learned their lessons. Once the ghost ship is discovered, the siege will be organized immediately, and they will not be given a chance to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, the human race pays the most attention to this aspect, especially the coastal countries, which are more aggressive in hunting down ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A combination of three ghost ships that can haunt during the day, like the one in front of you, can at least attract the pursuit of a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky and you are hunted down by several big countries at the same time, it may happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kill a ghost ship and go back with the remaining core, which can be exchanged for rewards in mainland countries. Titles, fiefdoms, gold, silver and jewelry, and cultivation resources can all be discussed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the countries have a sense of responsibility, it's mainly that the ghost ship's remaining core is a treasure in itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For those who practice dark magic, undead magic, wizards and other professions, this is the best auxiliary treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can get the cores of the three eighth-order ghost ships in front of you, you may be able to pile up a strong man in the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Hudson who didn't need this breakthrough, he would definitely choose to kill the ship and get the core. After all, one's own strength is the real strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, if these ghosts were not trapped in the ghost ship, they would be good magic materials themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some arcanists who are obsessed with research, everything can be used as research and development materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention little ghosts, even demons and angels are materials in their hands. Even in ancient times, some people wanted to use gods as research and development materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing so well, it's not surprising that he was labeled a heretic by the Holy See, and he is the number one blasphemy profession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Maxim was serious, the three ghost ships below quickly became potholed, the splints were rotten, and the cabin collapsed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that their home was tossed in a bad way, the ghosts were also angry. Ignoring the massacre of the fleet below, they joined the ranks of besieging Maxim one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Nether Sky!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the scream of the ghost king boss, countless ghosts turned into black mist one after another, covering the sun in the sky, and the yin energy between the sky and the earth continued to gather under the cloud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the shroud of black mist, the auras of the three ghost kings continued to grow, and they finally entered the ninth-level sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him made Hudson once again feel that \"the book is used only when it is used.\" The big moves displayed by the ghosts directly exceeded his cognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at Bear Stearns, the cub shook his head directly. The Earth Bear is just the king of the land, and a creature famous on the mainland for his house, so he has limited knowledge of things at sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention Maxim, as a giant dragon with incomplete inheritance, all the knowledge in his head comes from the indoctrination of the female dragon and his own accumulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his previous performance, it can be seen that Maxim's biological mother is not a responsible dragon. A lot of knowledge learned is incomplete, or too much private goods have been added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turns out that pit son is not racial.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops, the strength of the ghost king has been raised to the ninth level, the artillery is immediately in place, and all the magic crystal cannons are attacking the ghost ship in the front!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You need to be fast, you must break the secret technique of this group of ghosts, otherwise none of us will be able to leave today! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a blink of an eye, the fleet was shrouded in black mist. After losing their attack target, the fleet could only shoot randomly based on their senses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I hit the target. Anyway, the artillery fire can't stop, so it's a peace of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Byron, the magic crystal cannon can't be aimed, what should we do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo asked in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is still young, has a bright future, and has a wife and children waiting at home, so he doesn't want to be buried in this vast sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no other way, now we can only expect Earl Hudson to defeat the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giant dragons are powerful in combat, so it might be possible for a dragon knight to fight three against one. What's more, the Earl of Hudson also has an earth bear, so he shouldn't suffer a loss with two enemies and three! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron said uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theory is theory after all, the fighting power of the dragon is strong, and the fighting power of the ghost is not weak! Especially with the sky shrouded in it, it is obviously more suitable for ghosts to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the three ghost kings were forcibly upgraded, their understanding of the sanctuary realm would definitely be inferior to the dragon and bear who broke through naturally, and Byron would have no hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone on the boat had the same thoughts. For a while, they felt that today was going to be over, and for a while, they felt that they could still look forward to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't have time to pay attention to the thoughts of the people below. At this moment, Hudson, a dragon and a bear, were looking at the three Nether Kings who forcibly raised their cultivation bases. In order to see more clearly, he even released an illumination technique.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the words of Bear Stearns: A fake is a fake after all, no matter how the power is added, the three Nether Kings in front of you are just eighth-level ghosts with empty power and lack of comprehension of rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only disadvantage of this change is that the ghosts have turned into black mist, and Bear Stearns cannot continue to capture them. The plan to capture a ghost king alive was completely shattered at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson didn't take any action, they thought they were frightened, and the three Nether Kings who had completed their strength promotion all showed sinister smiles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Brother, I never thought that our three brothers would still have the opportunity to experience the treatment of a dragon slaying hero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big Stupid Dragon, I'll give you a chance to kill that dragon knight and use it as a mount for our brothers, and keep it for you to eat and drink…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the youngest ghost king could finish speaking, the enraged Maxim directly released the forbidden spell \"Doomsday Judgment\" that had been brewing for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames all over the sky seemed to condense together all of a sudden, heading directly towards the three Nether Kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three of them were so frightened that they dodged quickly, but unfortunately everything was in vain. The three of them who were locked could not escape the forbidden curse attack no matter where they ran. As a last resort, the three of them had no choice but to join forces and join forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collision happened in an instant, and the loud noise soared into the sky. The black mist that originally shrouded above was directly swallowed by the forbidden spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the blessing of the black mist, the three locked Nether Kings were naturally unable to please, and were directly sent back to the ship to be reborn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, the three Nether Kings who came to their senses made the same reaction one after another, and directly manipulated the ghost ship to turn around and leave in three directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the absence of ghosts in the team did not attract their attention. I am afraid that if I stay for a moment longer, I will be targeted by the terrifying enemy in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the enveloping black fog, the scene of the ghost ship escaping in a hurry fell directly into the eyes of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turning point came so suddenly that no one knew what to say. Immediately afterwards, it was the carnival of the rest of the catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought I was going to be buried in the sea, but I didn't expect that those who escaped became enemies, and the feeling of recovering a life is incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chasing and killing does not exist. Regardless of the heavy damage to the ghost ship, if it really catches up and encounters an encounter, it will be them who are unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson had no intention of pursuing, everyone did not speak without authorization. Making decisions for a dragon knight is not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After recovering from his stupefaction, Byron hastily ordered: \"Send down the order to let each ship count the number of casualties and count the losses!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just now the fire elements fluctuated violently, and the loud noise seemed to be someone releasing a forbidden spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the direction of the sound, the battlefield is not far from us. This is the sphere of influence of the Alpha Kingdom, I am afraid that most of the people who do it are enemies rather than friends! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Josip said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his tone, it is not difficult to hear his resentment towards the Alpha Kingdom. If the relationship between the two parties was not too bad, they would not have sneaked over under the cover of pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, you can tell from the sound that the forbidden spell just now is quite powerful. I'm afraid that even the most powerful people in the sanctuary will not be able to release it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a strong man may not be found in the whole continent. If the Alpha Kingdom has this kind of background, it will be revealed when the orcs invade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is reckoned that by gathering all the fire magicians from across the country, with the help of the power of the magic circle, they may be able to release this level of forbidden spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But we all know that the magic circle has never been better with as many people as possible. There are too many magicians gathered, how can the magicians in the main formation have such strong mental power control?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe a certain lich or demon provoked a Sanctuary Warcraft, triggering a big battle. However, it is really rare to see a fire-type sanctuary monster appearing in the sea! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Jelacic finished speaking, he realized something was wrong. The strong humans of the Alpha Kingdom are unable to release the forbidden spell alone, but it does not mean that there are no strong people of this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two met each other for a glance, and they both became suspicious of Hudson. There is no way, as the fourth dragon knight in the mainland, he is like a bright light in the dark night, there is no place to hide even if he wants to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the fire-type monsters are not mentally ill, they will not look for excitement to run to the sea. The only exception is the giant dragon. The God of Creation favored this species too much, allowing them to swim freely by land, sea and air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The next mission seems to be careful. If the dragon knight is involved, we may not be able to escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the home of other people after all, and no one knows more about the waters of Dulong Island than those gangsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the Alphas are too hostile to us, otherwise with their cooperation, this operation is really safe! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Yosip said with a sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single dragon knight, their team might be able to handle it. But since the enemy came to the door, there was no reason to come over alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are now posing as pirates. Even if the Alpha Kingdom wiped them all out as pirates, the Holy See would not be able to say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Complete the task first! If someone hadn't brought out the relic of that wicked beast from Dulong Island, we wouldn't even know that guy died here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finding the holy sword of light and the scepter of glory, with the blessing of the artifact, you and I can also exert the power of the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really meet Hudson, we can't beat the dragon, and can't we beat his crispy knight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is best to be able to avoid unnecessary complications. After completing the task, wait and see for a few days before going out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Northern Continental War is so severe, and Hudson is still waiting to preside over the overall situation. He can't be here all the time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jelacic said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who would have imagined that two of the three artifacts symbolizing theocracy, the holy crown, the holy sword of light, and the scepter of glory, were left outside, and the ones on the holy mountain were only Xibei goods?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involved a dark history of the Holy See, and everyone kept silent. Except for the high-level officials of the Holy See, the rest of the insiders were silenced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The message can be blocked, but the artifact must be retrieved. The treasure personally bestowed by the Lord of Dawn was not only an artifact, but also a symbol of orthodoxy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to retrieve the artifact, the Holy See has been tracking it down to the present. A lot of clues were collected along the way, but nothing was found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including this operation, it was also a dead horse as a living horse doctor. No one can tell whether the artifact is on Dulong Island or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the Holy See, even if there is only a chance, it must be tried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, one day the situation on the mainland will change, and countries will find out that the artifacts in their hands are counterfeit products, which will definitely cause a big mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man Beard, who secretly heard the conversation between the two, was already pale with fright. Under normal circumstances, to discuss such highly confidential news, at least one magic barrier must be released!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ship has such a large area, and it is inevitable for people to come and go. They didn't even bother to do the most basic taboo, and there was only one explanation - they were sure they could keep the secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is there anything in this world who can keep secrets better than the dead?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe not just death, even the soul will be destroyed together, completely cutting off the possibility of leaking secrets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he had already guessed in his heart that the Holy See would silence him, he was really sure, Man Beard still had a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an opportunity for other treasures, he may take the opportunity to get them as capital for his own recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An artifact symbolizing the orthodoxy of the Holy See, such a hot potato, even if it was given to him, a man with a beard would not dare to touch it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is touched by this thing, even if he is reduced to ashes, the Holy See will find him. It is useless to have the protection of big forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See is determined to kill a \"pirate\", no force will stand up for him. It is useless to accept the nomination certificate, his weight is not enough to make everyone and the Holy See turn against each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back on the ship, Hudson hid in the cabin to study the captured ghost on the grounds of replenishing his magic power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The casualties of the Dalton family have nothing to do with him. If it weren't for his Master Hudson's efforts to turn the tide, the Dalton family would have been seriously injured this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the loss of this main fleet, their maritime trade will definitely be affected. Without this most important income, it is not surprising that they will turn from prosperity to decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the time of the Continental War, Hudson would still need a good reputation to accumulate more political capital for himself, and they would definitely not be able to escape this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ah Piao, if you don't want to die, just sign the contract!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson fiddled with a soul contract directly on the parchment. It doesn't take too much effort to deal with this kind of third-order ghost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally an attempt. It would be best if the soul contract could control these ghosts, but it doesn't matter if it can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, you idiots, are you calling you? Hurry up and sign the contract!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fanboy version of Maxim followed suit and shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Master Hudson, although he didn't go hungry for nine meals in three days, his status was really not that high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to pretend to be aggressive in front of outsiders, but when you get to your own home, you are often bullied by bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly complaining can't afford to lose face, bickering is completely abused, and \"friendly discussion\" can't take advantage of it, Maxim really can't stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to change his position at the bottom, it is imperative to recruit more younger brothers. These ghosts are very good, and they look easy to bully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is disobedient, he can slap him to death with one paw. These guys would never dare to **** in front of Uncle Long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, along with the rapid growth of Maxim's strength, private discussions between dragons and bears have rarely happened recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to suppress Maxim in the front, apart from the strong talent of the Earth Bear itself, the most important thing is that Bear Stearns has a higher level of cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bloodline talents are sent to sanctuary, which is essentially just a process of power accumulation. Simply taking in more energy that can be digested can speed up the process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' growth was naturally fast, but after the blood talent was digested, the next comprehension of the rules was not just a matter of energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Maxim's strength has quickly caught up, and his own strength has reached its limit, Bear Stearns is naturally unwilling to continue to \"discuss\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the giant dragon is all-round, but the bear of the earth is partial. For dragons and bears of the same level of cultivation, unless they can take advantage of fighting on the ground, he can't beat the dragon in other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Maxim's lack of experience, he would not have been tortured so badly if he competed with Bear Stearns on the ground every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, who didn't know that he could turn himself into a serf and sing, is almost suffering from bear phobia, and continues to drag people into the bottom of the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Necromancer!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knowledgeable ghost said in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, the captured ghosts all trembled. Tossing the soul and body, necromancers are professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it falls into the hands of other people, the worst thing is to die. Anyway, it can be resurrected on the ship later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting a necromancer is different, death is a luxury. Fear awakened some of their remaining memories during their lifetime, and every ghost was terrified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you know about necromancers, it seems that you are not too stupid. Either sign the contract on your own initiative, or we will talk about this issue after a hundred years of soul refining.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson threatened with a half-smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The identity of the necromancer cannot be revealed, but if the insider is a group of ghosts, then it doesn't matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to leak the news, there is no place to report it. As dark creatures that everyone shouts and beats, no one will listen to their nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the ghost finished speaking, the fire of the soul was already burning. Under the unbearable pain, the unlucky ghost decisively left a mark on the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the establishment of the master-servant contract, Hudson, who was shouting and screaming, changed his face in an instant. The burning soul fire not only heard it, but also a pure force of darkness gushed out to repair the broken soul body for the ghost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghosts who were still hesitant at first signed the contract in a hurry. They all turned into their own ghosts, and the tense atmosphere in the room suddenly disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feeling the connection between the two, Hudson can be sure that if these ghosts are killed with the power of the contract at this moment, even the ghost ship will not be able to revive them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's talk about the ghost ship! Don't tell me, you don't know anything.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plain questioning, falling into the eyes of ghosts is endless terror. They did not forget the scene that burned their souls just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, we don't know how the ghost ship was born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In memory, we followed the captain to rob merchants from the beginning, growing up from ordinary people to the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We didn't even know we were dead until we met you. The daily living habits are not much different from ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially during the days on board, our memory seems to be affected, deliberately forgetting the passage of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, we can sense the location of the ghost ship. If you want to find them, we can lead the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghost who had suffered so much hurriedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, in these news, apart from the value of finding the location of the ghost ship, Hudson is not concerned about the rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The origins and weaknesses of the ghost ship are not introduced at all. They don't even remember their identities before they were alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the strength of the ghost ship, there is no need to introduce it at all. Hudson, who had fought once, knew better than themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing the location of the ghost ship, Hudson did not rush to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slave contract is not omnipotent. Although ghosts can be forcibly enslaved, their spiritual power must be overwhelmed by these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His spiritual power is indeed good, but at most he can forcibly enslave a few ghosts of the same realm, and if there are more, he will face backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to control the ghost and then control the ghost ship, it seems that it will not work now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson suddenly slapped his head. It's unrealistic to forcibly enslave the three ghost kings with my own mental power, but it would be different if it was replaced by Bear Stearns and Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a strong man in the sanctuary, it is not a big problem to suppress three ghosts whose strength is lower than his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all their own people, and it doesn't matter who controls the ghost ship. Anyway, these powers are invisible and can only be used in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson believes that he is not the first person to call attention to the ghost ship, and he will not be the last. Who doesn't have the strength to do dirty work among those big forces that have inherited the ancients!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While thinking about it, the ship suddenly shook violently, and Hudson immediately thought of \"Storm at Sea\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current season is not a period of high incidence of storms, but it is possible for any unreasonable natural phenomenon to occur on the vast sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The laws summed up by human beings are only suitable for most of the time. Encountered sudden extreme weather, it can only blame their bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he stepped out of the ship, Hudson saw a sailor climbing the mast thrown into the sea, and was about to be swallowed by the sea. In the end, he instructed Maxim to pull him back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the lucky ones who happen to be seen by Hudson are only a minority after all. Most of the unlucky ones ended their lives as soon as they fell into the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The master on board reacted very quickly, and soon someone jumped up and forcibly lowered the sail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shaking intensity of the ship has been slightly reduced, but under the baptism of wind and waves, it can only drift with the current.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A good fleet, abruptly pulled away by the wind and waves. Two of the small warships were directly overturned by the waves because they were a step slower in reacting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the fleet commander, Byron had a gloomy and terrifying face. The proper start was unfavorable, and the enemy's shadow was not even touched, so he suffered a series of blows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First encountered a ghost ship attack, and then encountered a sea storm, this luck does not know how to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing being forced forward by the wind and waves, Hudson could only shake his head secretly. In the face of the mighty power of nature, human beings are still too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to use magic to forcibly control the ship, but if you fight against the wind and waves in this way, the damage to the hull will be very large, and it may directly cause the ship to fall apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, these ships are still wooden sail warships. Even if the magic circle is blessed, it does not have the ability to confront the wind and waves head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at Viscount Kayo in front of him, Hudson didn't speak. This guy didn't help command the fleet, and ran to hang around him, obviously a little clever ghost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the wind and waves continue to expand and swallow the entire fleet, it is undoubtedly the safest to follow Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how severe the natural disaster is, the survival rate of the Dragon Knight is guaranteed. Even if it ran to the center of the storm and wandered around, the dragon could still retreat completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, the current wind and waves are so strong that the fleet can only drift with the wind. Maybe the fog in our poisonous dragon sea area will be blown away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think it is better for us to evacuate, or continue to search for pirates? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cayoteau said almost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This topic does not have much discussion value. You have come, how can you return empty-handed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"With such a good opportunity, I naturally went to see the Dulong Island. Not everyone has the opportunity to see the legendary place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the pirates, I don't think their situation will be much better than ours. Especially those four-faced warships transformed from merchant ships, the current situation will only be worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't meet them, they deserve their lives; if you meet them, you can deal with them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, at this moment he is really interested in Dulong Island. Without the fog blocking the view, the greatest danger is gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dangers on the island, and the cannon fodder of the Dalton family are available. He, Lord Hudson, will not be in danger until the fleet is dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Island!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is an island ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the cheers from his subordinates, Man Beard was about to be blown up, but he couldn't help cheering on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sea area is a poisonous dragon island, and the island in front of them is obviously the destination of their trip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was directly brought to the terminal by the wind and waves, how could he play with it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to let the fleet approach the island!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man Beard ordered bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People from the Holy See watched from the sidelines and cheered a few times, no one would feel that something was wrong. If they refused to dock uncharacteristically, it would immediately arouse the suspicion of the Holy See and his party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Manbeard can only hope that the fleet of the Dalton family will arrive sooner. Otherwise, once the task is completed, it will be the end of this pirate team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

They were sent to Dulong Island by the wind and waves, and many ships were stranded on the beach.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron said respectfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Status comes from strength. Since yesterday's shot, Hudson's position on board has become even more detached. Originally just came to help, but now it has become the backbone of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, first encountered the disaster of the ghost ship, and then visited by the storm, the fleet of the Dalton family has suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Casualties exceeded two thousand and five, and seven warships sank, including two third-class capital ships and one second-class capital ship. The number of damaged ships is even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss was as heavy as a naval battle. Paying such a high price has nothing to do with the task, and Byron doesn't know how to go back and explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have developed to this point, and there is no way to retreat. If the pirates were not wiped out, wouldn't the Dalton family lose in vain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to reduce the next loss, he can only choose to ask Hudson for help. After all, the forbidden spell released by Maxim before was very astonishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warships can't stand the baptism of the forbidden curse. If they can be given to the pirates, they can at least take away a few capital ships of the enemy, and the subsequent battles will be easier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Byron, after the storm last night, how long will it take for this sea area to be shrouded in fog again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to family records, after the location of Dulong Island is exposed, there is usually a window period of three to five days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Earl, don't you want to go to the island?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This place is not a good place, even if it is not shrouded in fog, Dulong Island is extremely dangerous! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Byron's answer, Hudson immediately shook his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry about going to the island, let's wait and see the situation and let the pirates find the way for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how much they have harvested, if we clear them afterwards, things will still fall into our hands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island, the pirates who didn't know they were being targeted encountered trouble as soon as they landed. Caught off guard, dozens of people started foaming at the mouth out of nowhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, be careful, almost all the animals and plants on the island are highly poisonous, so don't touch them with your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The source of water is even more out of reach. The last time I came here, I saw someone drank the water on the island and turned into a pile of bones! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man Beard hurriedly reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people sent out to explore the way are all his younger brothers. Every time one dies, the probability of him getting rid of the control of the Holy See is one point lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hurry up, we don't have time to delay. Once the Alphas discover Duron Island, things will be troublesome!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Josip reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having dealt with pirates many times, he knows very well that pirates \"fear power but not morality\". To treat these vicious people is to be more cruel than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are all a group of scourges, and it is their honor to dedicate themselves to spreading the glory of the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accompanying members of the Holy See turned into overseers one after another at this moment, urging the pirates to explore forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Dragon Island\", which claims to be able to poison dragons to death, is of course not in vain. Even with the reminder of the savage beard, the danger on the island is hard to guard against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching teams of pirates continue to fall, Paladin Jelacic also realized that something was wrong. According to this method of exploration, it is estimated that the pirates will be exhausted before searching for the complete island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Josip, the situation seems to be a little bad. It only took two miles to lose hundreds of people. If it continues, this group of pirates may collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let our people use magic to open the way and clear some obstacles to reduce the casualties of the pirates. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Bishop Yosip nodded. The \"artifact\" is not a crispy thing, even if it is hit by magic, it will not hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are no artifacts destroyed, but those are rare events that can only happen when the peak powerhouse fights with artifacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the magic was released, the casualties of the pathfinding pirates were instantly reduced, but the speed of exploration was also reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magical power and spiritual power of a magician are not unlimited. In a dangerous place like Dulong Island, it is necessary to maintain its own strength at all times. After releasing magic several times in turn, the team has to stop and recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Island Master, I found a dilapidated palace ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the pathfinder pirates attracted everyone's attention. The whole group of the Holy See, in particular, secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The constant killing of poisonous insects along the way made them almost become automatic insecticides. If there is no harvest, you can be laughed to death when you go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Keep exploring!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Yosip preemptively ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he has already sensed the sacred aura, and the artifact is likely to be nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what the pirates think, what does that matter to him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the task is completed, these guys are a bunch of dead people, so don't worry about it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the order was issued, there was a sound of \"swish, swish\", and countless poisonous snakes sprayed from the palace to the crowd, and hundreds of people died in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Holy See's overseer team suffered casualties for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two level 5 mages were unfortunately hit by a poisonous snake, and they fell to the ground and died in an instant. The accompanying priests had no time to rescue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone be careful, these are puppet snakes refined by witchcraft, and they are the snake spirit guards guarding the emperor's tomb in the ancient wizard kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that every snake has a human soul sealed inside it. It has been stripped of human emotions, but retains its previous combat experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, these snake spirit guards are in a deep sleep state, and will only be awakened when they are invaded by foreign enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Snake Spirit Guard is just one of the guardians of the cemetery. There are many strange products in the ancient wizard kingdom, each of which is extremely evil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have disturbed the cemetery guards, and the next thing is the endless ending. Even if you leave now, you will be attacked in various ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next exploration must be vigilant. Any carelessness will pay the price in blood. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The well-informed Paladin Jelacic warned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wizards are a mysterious and powerful group. In ancient times, it became the mainstream of human cultivation, but all things inevitably flourish and decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the emergence of gods, the wizard system soon declined, replaced by magic and knights, and gradually became a marginal profession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the Holy See dominated the mainland, wizards were thrown into heretical industries, and their inheritance was almost cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surviving wizards have only inherited a small part of the inheritance, and most of the wizarding secrets have disappeared in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The treasure hunt turned into a tomb robbery, and I was drunk thinking about it. However, Bishop Josip used the secret method to detect the artifact, and the artifact was nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happened that the cardinal who betrayed the Holy See was a hidden wizard. There are ways to avoid the cemetery guards, which makes sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pace of progress is taken again, and various dangers are also coming. Blood paves the way forward, and almost every step forward has to pay the price of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, ever since he heard the news that Hudson was going to sea, Caesar IV was about to explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the kingdom's military affairs not come to preside over it, and go to exterminate the little pirates, a typical putting the cart before the horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, anger solves nothing. The stalemate between the two sides is essentially a power game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As king, Caesar IV wants to control everything; as the future commander of the army, Hudson also needs to strive for more dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question now depends on who will make concessions first. The situation is obvious, Caesar IV is more restless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The complex international situation has brought too much pressure on him, and it is impossible to be as calm as Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the game of power, this mentality will undoubtedly suffer a lot. At this critical moment, the more urgent you are, the easier it is for your opponent to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, the Earl of Hudson is not doing his job properly. How about we change to someone else to be the commander in chief of strategic mobilization?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV suggested angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No monarch likes uncontrolled minions. No matter how strong the ability is, it is meaningless if it cannot be controlled in the hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson did this in a centralized country, it would be death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in joint-stock countries, this kind of thing is too common. The game of subject power and monarchy is playing out almost every moment. There are countless similar cases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the matter has not reached this point. It is not easy to find a replacement for Earl Hudson in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other races, we are at a disadvantage after all. If the selected people are not capable enough to repeat the tragedy of the Warhammer Kingdom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Caesar IV's face became more and more ugly, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland immediately realized that he had made a slip of the tongue. The Kingdom of Warhammer is indeed the best negative teaching material, but Joseph II's ouster is also a taboo for all kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the situation in the mainland, everyone has no time to intervene in the past, but it does not mean that they can tolerate this kind of thing happening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of Caesar IV, this is forced palace. It seemed to be warning him that if he did not accept everyone's selection, he would follow in the footsteps of Joseph II.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty appease your anger, perhaps there is a reason why the Earl of Hudson went to exterminate the pirates himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information reported by the Southeast Province, the pirates who broke in suddenly were obviously aimed at the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment when the whole country is preparing for war, if there is such a threat of pirates in the rear, the future logistics transportation will inevitably encounter big troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a good thing for the kingdom to clean up these unstable factors first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Effiero persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that these words fell into the ears of Caesar IV, and everything changed. Unstable factors, is there any greater unstable factor in the kingdom than Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they can use the opportunity of war to demand power from him. What if the war breaks out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe he just made up a few excuses and made him empty. It is not unheard of in the Alpha Kingdom that powerful ministers emptied the monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Caesar IV still maintained his sanity and did not speak out what was in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of things in politics, it's okay if you don't pierce the window paper; once you pierce it, there is no room for relaxation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until a replacement for Hudson cannot be found, the substitution is just an angry statement from Caesar IV, and it is impossible to actually implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if another person comes up, he won't be fighting for power with the monarch?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is simply impossible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who is the commander in chief of the army, it is inevitable to demand power from him, the king. The difference is limited to the size of appetite and whether the operation method is more acceptable to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's wait and see, if it's really worth fighting. If it's just for power and profit, then the next...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the sea area of ​​Dulong Island, the army guarded the periphery for two days, and there was no sign of pirates leaving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson hadn't personally gone to investigate and confirmed that the pirate team was exploring the palace, he would have wondered if the people had left from somewhere else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, a sacred aura emerged from the direction of Dulong Island. In Hudson's mind, an \"artifact\" immediately appeared!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having played with the broken artifact, the Blood Moon Horn, Hudson is also very interested in artifacts. However, the blood moon horn had too many side effects, and he was really reluctant to die, so he could only sell it for a good price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Byron, pass on the army to advance immediately to the Dragon Island!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arriving at the place, don't rush to land, first use the magic crystal cannon to destroy the pirates' ships and cut off their way back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical distraction, but Hudson no longer cares so much. There are not many artifacts that have been handed down on the mainland, and almost every artifact has a prominent owner behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only depends on strength, but also depends on luck. As far as Hudson knows, none of the forces in the Northern Continent has a single artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly, then I don't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Principality of Moxi definitely does not have it, or it cannot be used if it has an artifact. Otherwise, when the orc army besieged their capital, it should be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that the Alpha Kingdom does not exist. In the past hundreds of years, no matter how critical the situation was, no kingdom had ever used a divine weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the case for a country, let alone an individual. Hudson didn't even dare to think about the magic weapon that the major forces put on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, an unowned artifact appeared. If you didn't grab it, you would be a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how to deal with it after grabbing it, he, Master Hudson, is not only the \"strong man\" at the peak of the mainland, but also the commander-in-chief of the kingdom's army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is not too hot, there is a high probability that it can be held. If the political pressure is too great, at worst, it will be used as an inheritance artifact for the kingdom in exchange for substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, Hudson went to Dulong Island first, ready to **** the fruits of victory from the opponent at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hahaha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Finally found!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bishop Josip burst into tears of excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the two artifacts in front of them, the Holy See and his party were filled with emotion. They have spent half their lives searching for this thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that where there are clues, there are them. Time and time again, they ended up without a cause. If they hadn't been firm in their beliefs, they would have collapsed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several families are happy and others are sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the Holy See and his party continue to cheer, the pirates who accompanied them were crying. This treasure hunt trip was entirely made up of their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most people don't know what the Holy See is looking for, they still understand the principle of \"a rabbit dies like a dog\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's clear the field first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jeracic said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such words, said from the mouth of a paladin, will definitely refresh the three views of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A paladin known for his holiness, kindness, and modesty...is actually able to do this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to Jelachich, who is determined to dedicate everything to the gods, this is nothing at all. How can a little fame compare to the artifact of welcoming back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The massacre has begun. None of the pirates who have completed the expedition mission exists, and they are no longer a threat to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clearing up the hidden dangers as soon as possible to ensure that the artifact can be sent back safely is the most important thing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, Jeracic took the lead in attacking the nearby pirates, and the rest responded one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pirates who were beaten up, after realizing the danger, hurriedly fled one by one, lest they run too slowly and become dead souls under the sword.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the sky, Hudson, who was running all the way and dared to come, happened to witness this extraordinary internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's a member of the Holy See again. Could it be that I have been at odds with the Holy See in my life, and I am responsible for ruining their good deeds?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sighed secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking a look at the battlefield, it was completely one-sided massacre. Countless pirates fled around crying for their fathers and mothers, and they couldn't organize an effective counterattack at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, you see, since I debuted, I have changed seven knight swords in my hand, and it is not a solution to change them all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find an opportunity to help me grab the sword below. Only the divine sword can match my body...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the words were finished, the cub had already rushed out. He just slapped the cardinal below, then picked up the holy sword of light and ran away, leaving no time for the people of the Holy See to react, which made Hudson secretly annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I had known that I could play like this, I would have asked Bear Stearns to **** the two artifacts back together. Why should I add drama to myself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island is full of poisons, which is not suitable for human survival at all. After destroying the ships of the pirates, after ten days and half a month, almost all of these people met the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's troublesome, I have to grab another artifact. Otherwise, these guys will definitely find a way to hide the artifact at a critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you stay on the island, no matter how deep it is hidden, you can find it. If they knew the secret method of sealing the aura of the artifact and threw the thing directly into the deep sea, they would not be able to find it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, have you seen it clearly? When you do it in the future, learn from Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A cardinal didn't even know what happened, so he saw and bid farewell to the world in a daze. This is the real battlefield to kill the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already taken the artifact. Immediately afterwards, the mysterious compass was driven, sealing the sacred breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just from the surface, it looks like an ordinary knight's sword. No one would have guessed that this unattractive guy is still a divine weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earth-shattering changes directly affected the battlefield below. All the masters of the Holy See who were killing Zhenghuan no longer cared about chasing and killing the pirates at this moment, and surrounded Zhun Hudson one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything was in vain. After being warned, Maxim also learned his lesson. He didn't have the slightest intention of going down to fight the enemy hand-to-hand, and directly played magic attacks in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the seven eighth-level powerhouses in the Holy See who can fly to the enemy, the rest are only a group of magicians who can also provide fire support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they found Hudson as the culprit, but they couldn't keep an eye on the elusive bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns deliberately shrunk his figure, relying on his absolute superiority in strength, he didn't get entangled with the enemy at all, and kept wandering around the battlefield to sneak up on the magician.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the death of the unlucky cardinal, several seventh-level magisters died immediately, and even more magisters and great magisters were taken away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the dragon knight was only attracting firepower on the surface, the people in the Holy See immediately stopped chasing and turned to guard the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they wanted to slip away, but Maxim refused. An eighth-rank paladin whose speed was a bit slow was directly swept by the dragon's tail, and before he could recover, Hudson made up his sword again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sacred weapons are extraordinary, even the defense of an eighth-level paladin can be defeated with one stab.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the well-trained members of the Holy See completed their formation. I saw a white-haired old man picking up a magic wand, still chanting spells in his mouth, and the nearby light elements continued to gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing how powerful the artifact is, Hudson would not be foolish enough to carry it on. He slapped Maxim on the **** and disappeared from everyone's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The witty Bear Stearns has long since disappeared. This confused the old man holding the divine weapon. The forbidden spell was half brewed, but the enemy disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stopping does not exist. He is not a strong man in the sanctuary, and his ability to release the forbidden spell is entirely dependent on the blessing of the divine weapon. Halfway through the magic, it is simply beyond his control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While hesitating, the roaring magic crystal cannon sounded, and the violent vibration almost made the magic fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without further hesitation, the old man roared angrily and unleashed the curse on the fleeing pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bishop Josip was killed, Knight Jerachic is now in charge of the overall situation, what should we do now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jerachich frowned at the white-haired old man's question. They suffered heavy losses in the attack just now. If they come a few more times, they won't have to go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are only a few dragon knights on the mainland. It should be Hudson who attacked us just now. Everyone knows who is the real owner, and it won't be too late to settle accounts with him in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now we have to get out of here alive! The news of the artifact has been exposed, and there is a lot of artillery fire outside. It should be the navy of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the sound, it should be destroying the ships we left outside. Now we must be fast, and we must save at least one warship! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, a miserable sound was heard. A Tier 6 Golden Knight in the fringe area had his head separated from his body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of the dragon chant sounded again in the distance, and the dragon language magic had already swept over their heads. Everyone was so frightened that they hurriedly joined hands to set up the magic shield, and the white-haired old man picked up the magic weapon again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, sneak attacks come faster and retreat faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is Hudson an Assassin?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He only knows how to sneak attack from behind, he doesn't fight us head-on at all, he doesn't have the demeanor of a strong man at all! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man growled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sacred artifacts are not easy to drive, especially in the case of insufficient realm, it is even more expensive to forcibly activate the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson directly picks up the artifact to slash people, without borrowing the power of the artifact itself, except.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Maxim was able to control the forbidden curse freely, if they didn't avoid it, what fell would be the real forbidden curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resisting the forbidden curse with their small bodies, ninety-nine out of ten will end up in ashes, and there is a one percent chance of leaving a little wreckage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you choose to dodge, the original defensive formation will be gone. In the face of Bear Stearns' sneak attack, if he was prepared, the eighth-rank paladin could still make two moves, and the rest would be in a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disparity in strength is too great. No matter how well prepared you are, you can't stop the strong in the sanctuary from launching a sneak attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially magicians are the worst. Even the eighth-level great magister, once Bear Stearns gets close, there is no room for struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragon attracts everyone's attention in front, and the earth bear plays a sneak attack from behind. Such a golden combination directly made the Holy See and his party lose their temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the continuous reduction of the team, and wanting to organize a counterattack, I don't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the dragon knight Hudson would be a weakness, but unfortunately the dragon didn't play close combat with them, but just released magic harassment in the sky from a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After advancing less than five kilometers, they were attacked seven times. The original team of more than 200 people has now been reduced by more than half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing the seriousness of the problem, Jerachic said with a gloomy face: \"The gang of hypocritical nobles have the most reputation, and Hudson was able to lower his face and sneak attack, making it clear that he was not going to let us leave alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gunfire has stopped, and the enemy's navy is outside. The evacuation plan we made earlier is no longer feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the only way we can break out is to take shelter on the island first, and wait for the fog to cover the sea area again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The target is too big for everyone to gather together, and it is easy to be targeted by the enemy. Then we spread out and live or die by luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as someone is alive, bring the news back, let...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, he was interrupted by the meteorite rain falling from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy's sneak attack is coming again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea came to mind, Jerachich didn't hesitate any longer, and immediately ordered: \"Separate and go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This order is very cruel, which means that most of the people in the team will die in the pursuit of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, instead of gathering together and being grinded to death by the enemy's sneak attacks round after round; it is better to disperse to hide and seek that glimmer of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the ship is destroyed by the enemy, even if everyone gathers together, there is no way to evacuate Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I can only bet on my life, betting that after the fog covers this sea area again, there will be merchant ships straying into this place, creating a chance for them to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, they could only be trapped and starved to death on this isolated island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team fled in all directions, and indeed won a glimmer of life, but it also created an opportunity for Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it could only be a sneak attack, but now it has directly become a chase. Flying separately in the face of disaster, you don't need to outperform the enemy, just outperform your companions is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man running at the front of the team suddenly realized that something was wrong. He always felt that something was staring at him from his back. When he looked back, it was a giant dragon that was chasing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, I have something to discuss! Everyone is...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the old man could finish speaking, the rain of fire had enveloped the sky, scaring him to dodge in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything was in vain. He escaped the magic attack, but he couldn't avoid Maxim's dragon wagging its tail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crispy skin attribute of the magician is exposed at this moment. Even if he propped up the magic shield, he still couldn't avoid the fate of being patted into flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was at the last moment before his death that the old man realized the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no grievances and no enmity, so many younger brothers along the way did not kill, and he was specifically caught and chased by him, obviously for the \"glory scepter\" in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it was too late for everyone to realize all this. If he had reacted earlier and thrown the artifact in his hand when he was running for his life, he would definitely not have died so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting away the scepter of glory, Hudson sighed. It's not that he's cruel and merciless, it's because things are too tricky, so I have to silence him!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he took the Excalibur just now, he hadn't realized it yet. When the old man released the forbidden spell with the help of the staff, he realized that it was the legendary \"Scepter of Glory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Crown\", \"Scepter of Glory\", and \"Holy Sword of Light\", the standard three-piece set of the Holy See's artifacts, unexpectedly two of them fell into his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this news gets out, there will never be peace in the Mountain Territory. Not only is the Holy See looking for trouble for him, but other forces in the mainland will also spy on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at this Holy See squad, you can see how deep the real top power is, and it is simply not something he, a dragon knight, can parry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, the only way to kill them is to silence them. Hudson has already made up his mind, if he can't strangle all the Holy See and his party, then block the foggy sea area and prohibit ships from traveling this route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is obviously not something that he can accomplish alone. It is only possible to do it together with several nearby coastal nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Hudson's current status, it is not difficult to ask everyone to sell favors, but the difficulty is not to arouse suspicion from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nature, the more you block it, the easier it is to arouse everyone's curiosity. The blockade of the route can only block the passing merchant ships, but it cannot stop these great nobles from sending people to explore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two paths before Hudson:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, carve up the two artifacts with the Dalton family and face the crisis together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just based on Hudson's understanding of Earl Pierce, he is not such a courageous person. What's more, artifacts are of no real significance to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political significance of the artifact is mainly to divide the legal system of the Holy See, which cannot be controlled by a large noble alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both artifacts are of the light system, and at least two eighth-level practitioners of the light system must be found to be able to basically drive them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they gave the artifact to the Dalton family, they couldn't find anyone who could use it. For the Dalton family, keeping the artifact in their hands is purely a hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second, throw one piece to the king, divert the firepower, and return some benefits by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the only people who knew that he had obtained the two artifacts were people from the Holy See. As long as these people are not allowed to leave alive, the outside world will not know that both artifacts are in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a miracle that such a artifact can meet one. If you meet two people at once, no one will believe you when you tell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, you can only gain if you give up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson made a choice between the two artifacts. The \"Scepter of Glory\" can't be used at all, and the \"Holy Sword of Light\" can still be used to cut people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the sealed holy sword of light looks similar to his knight sword. Because of Maxim, no one dared to check his knight sword up close, and no one would notice if it was replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A decision was made, and when Hudson wanted to catch a living person for questioning, Bear Stearns finished the work first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few lucky ones who were hidden, the rest either became ghosts under the claws of bears, or died under the mouths of poisonous insects. If you want to get an answer from them, you may have to summon the undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does know a little bit of undead magic, but how could someone who has dealt with heresy for a long time be unprepared?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The holy water they carry with them greatly reduces the probability of turning them into undead. Even if the summoning is successful, most undead creatures cannot retain the memory of their lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why the \"Battle of Glory\" and \"Holy Sword of Light\" appeared here has become an unsolved mystery here in Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high level of the Holy See must know, but it is impossible for him to ask. It is important to satisfy curiosity, but it is even more important to keep your life alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting down his inquisitive thoughts, he picked up the artifact and returned to the fleet, only to see a group of pirates gathered on the shore to surrender to the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these guys who surrendered are smart people. Knowing that the people of the Holy See would not let them go, they decisively changed their followers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they are in trouble at this moment. The fleet in front of them not only represents the Dalton family, but also the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two companies can work together, but how to deal with these pirates needs to be decided after discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps out of respect for the strong, the fleet just let the pirates stay on the shore, and did not immediately accept their surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the leader of the pirates resting on the shore, Hudson said indifferently: \"I will give you a chance to survive and explain everything you know clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to hide it, without our shelter, you can't survive a month on the island! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already begun to think about whether to silence this group of people together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates are pirates after all, even if they surrendered, Hudson can still find an excuse to kill them all, not to mention that they have not yet accepted their surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, my lord, I will explain everything!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was a down-and-out aristocrat in a small country in the middle of the country. Because of the decline of my family, I went out to find a living, and was later spotted by people from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, according to their instructions, he has become a pirate and has been active in the south-central waters all year round.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was chosen to go north to Dulong Island this time, mainly because I entered this place by mistake once when I was wandering in the mainland, and I survived and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose of the Holy See's trip seems to be to find some artifact on the island. My status in the Holy See is very low, and that's all I know. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Man Beard's answer, Hudson's killing intent subsided a bit. It doesn't matter if you don't know, but you're afraid of knowing too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who asks, Master Hudson only got one artifact in Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have already obtained the artifact, but there are still many remnants of the Holy See active on the island. These people are not weak, and they hide in the dark, so there is no time to encircle and suppress them for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron, before the fog can block your view, you send people to search around the island and destroy all the ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an antique ship from hundreds of years ago, I will smash it to pieces with the magic crystal cannon. Don't let go of large pieces of wood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time left for us is running out, we must destroy all the navigation tools before the fog rises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's put these pirates here first, I'll watch them in person, and I'll take them with me when I go back! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Command tone, should not appear among partners. However, Hudson's status is special, and he also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Kingdom's war readiness mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A position where even he himself can't figure out the boundaries of power, the outside world is even more confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it has the power to mobilize the country's armed forces, the capital did not give an accurate statement, but this does not affect Hudson's ordering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Obey, Lord Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron replied respectfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to discuss the ownership of the artifact, but he forcibly took it back when the words came to his lips. Regardless of who the artifact belongs to, it is not his turn to be a descendant of his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earl's nephew did not open his mouth to talk about this issue, and he was too lazy to be the first bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Negotiating this kind of thing needs to pay attention to identity reciprocity. Letting them negotiate with Hudson will obviously suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet began to perform missions, and only Viscount Cayo stayed in place with a group of guards and Hudson. In name, they helped guard the pirates, but in fact they still missed the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson snatched the thing, and Kayo really didn't know what excuse to intervene to get a share of the action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Scepter of Glory, are you interested?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson threw the scepter in his hand to Viscount Cayo without hesitation, as if he had lost a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The scepter of glory of the Holy See!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How can this be?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo said with a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the symbol of the Holy See, the scepter of glory will appear in almost every grand ceremony. There is no news of the loss at all, but the magic wand in his hand cannot deceive anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Kayo hastily returned the scepter of glory to Hudson. This thing is really not something that the Dalton family can worry about, taking it back will only bring disaster to their own family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, you obtained this item, you can handle it yourself, we will not participate!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson pretended to be embarrassed and showed a wry smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The scepter of glory is different from ordinary artifacts, and it is really too hot for our two families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Dalton family is not interested, I will send it to the capital. If His Majesty the King wants to establish a separate Holy See, this is the best legal basis. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV is not Caesar III, no one can be sure whether he dares to take this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But throwing things out is better than staying in the southeast province and causing trouble for oneself. With the size of the Alpha Kingdom, as long as the king has ambitions, he can still withstand the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, this topic is too sensitive. There are still a group of pirates here, and it is really not suitable for discussion now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kayo said in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is really scared. Hudson can talk about things in an open and honest manner, because his own strength is strong enough, and he is not burdened with too many debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo can't. Although he is a direct member of the Dalton family, he is only a \"member\" and not the heir of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political weight is much lower than that of Hudson. If you get involved recklessly, you might die at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Holy See, it is very difficult to kill a dragon knight, but it is not difficult to kill a son of a great nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In political struggles, Hudson has never done things absolutely, but he is worried that he will push people into a hurry, and the other party will directly break through all political bottom lines and attack ordinary members of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, the Scepter of Glory is not suitable for keeping. I will send it to the capital after dealing with the affairs on the island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These pirate captives can only be used as coolies, they are of little value, and there is no need to subdivide them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply, you and I each have half, and you can send half of the people to the mountain area afterwards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naked conspiracy, the opportunity is given. If the Dalton family wants a piece of the pie, they just need to send someone to follow them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The artifact cannot be given in vain, and the king will definitely compensate in other ways. The benefits are visible to the naked eye, but the risks are also close at hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is uncertain how long the news can be blocked. Once it is spread, the political consequences of robbing the artifact and killing important members of the Holy See will be borne by both families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these, some pirate captives are really not worth mentioning. For the Dalton family, these people can only be used as coolies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment he took the scepter of glory, Viscount Kayo's first reaction was to silence these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few hundred captives in the area, and the Dalton family, which has a large family and business, does not lack this labor force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can decide for yourself, we will not participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The successful completion of this operation is mainly due to your credit. You have the right to dispose of all spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates captured, we will send you a lot of them to your territory afterwards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo hastily refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He believed that even if his uncle was here, he would make a similar decision. If they had known that there was a scepter of glory on Dulong Island, they would not have joined in the fun no matter what.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is not to mention the loss of the family, and it may be involved in the maelstrom of the game between kingship and theocracy. If the family is not careful, the family will be photographed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Hudson handle this kind of hatred. Dragon knights are rough and thick, and can withstand wind and rain, ordinary people like them can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Kayo's desire for strength reached its peak. The lack of peak combat power has become the biggest shortcoming restricting the development of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the abnormality of the dragon knight, even training a few eighth-level powerhouses can increase one's own right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is Kayo not knowing what happened on the island. If he knew that in the team sent by the Holy See this time, there were eight eighth-level powerhouses and more than twenty seventh-level powerhouses, his perception of peak powerhouses would change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no intention of showing off his record, and the way he wins is not in line with the aristocratic spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buying the truth forever is the best choice. When the Holy See retaliates in the future, it is better to let the Dalton family accompany them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purely from the statistics, there is not a single weakling in the Vatican team of more than 200 people. Obviously, it is not possible for Hudson to kill all of them with one person and two monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the understanding of normal people, the Dalton family must have participated in the battle, and the two sides joined hands to commit the murder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People will only believe what they see. The Dalton family fleet suffered heavy losses, and there is a high probability that the Holy See will calculate the battle losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ghost Ship\", \"Storm at Sea\", the more legendary these legends are, the less people believe them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fog gradually thickened, as if it was about to cover the entire sea area, and the noisy Dulong Island became silent again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet began to slowly return home. A dragon chant pierced through the air, and Hudson had already left first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
