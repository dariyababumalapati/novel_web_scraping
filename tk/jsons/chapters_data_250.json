The supervising team stared at the back, and no one dared to take half a step back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human soldiers on the city wall, some of them held sharp knives to kill the orcs who climbed up the wall, and some threw boulders vigorously, and poured a pot of fire oil down from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raging fire quickly ignited under the city wall, and then spread rapidly. The orc soldiers who unfortunately fell into the sea of ​​fire were directly reduced to fuel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still a faint smell of meat coming out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trebuchets and magic crystal cannons on both sides launched the most intense confrontation, and the defenders had the upper hand in terms of firepower, but the Yingmen in the sky pulled back the round for the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the long-range strike capabilities of the two sides are almost the same. What is fighting now is strength. The defenders have the advantage of the city, but the orcs also have an advantage in strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is charging, and the Ratman and Ant-Man in the rear... have turned into \"earthwork engineers\" and started earthwork construction operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the land near the city has been processed. Not only is it surprisingly hard, but also buried a lot of boulders, which has brought great inconvenience to these \"earthwork engineers\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when approaching the city wall, the magicians guarding the city also kept interfering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless \"earthwork engineers\" have been permanently buried underground before they have had time to touch the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After failed attempts again and again, the orc general commanding the army was not only not annoyed, but showed a satisfied expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the most capable of covering up problems, but it is also the easiest to expose problems. The seemingly unbreakable line of defense, with the continuation of the war, the sequelae caused by the death of high-level generals are gradually exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the cooperation of troops in different regions, the response ability is obviously much slower, and it is far less flexible than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a strong head coach, the substitute generals lack prestige, and the nobles below lack sufficient awe, it is inevitable to compromise when executing orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the new general is far less familiar with the army than the previous commander. When assigning tasks, he often made some jokes, which exacerbated this contradiction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is all determined by human nature. An army can only have one commander. While maintaining their prestige, the nobles are also subconsciously reducing the presence of the deputy commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is noble from the same province, it is normal for the boss to suppress the second, and the nobles below are also forced to stand in line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the boss suddenly hangs up, and the second son is replaced to command the army. If there are no problems, that is the biggest problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an unsolvable problem. It is difficult for a noble in a province to command, and it is even more difficult for a commander to be airborne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are temporarily slow, but a series of operations are half a beat slow, and it will eventually lead to a big accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the **** battlefield, Abraham smiled indifferently, and was about to order the orc priest to act, when a figure suddenly appeared and startled him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, why are you here?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words came out of his mouth, Abraham realized that he had made a slip of the tongue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the emperor of the Beamon clan and the head of the five giants of the Orc Empire, Emperor Beamon does not need to report to anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, at this moment, Emperor Bimon was so focused on the battlefield that he didn't notice his gaffe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry about you guys, come and see for yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's been so long since the war started, and they haven't been able to tear through the Alpha Kingdom's defenses yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abraham, your performance is not good! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly understated comments fell into Abraham's ears, but it was like a blow to the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the victory or defeat on the battlefield, it's not up to him as a general to decide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Crown Prince of the family and the emperors of the four clans decided to make a breakthrough from the Principality of Moxi, and the number of troops on the front line of the Alpha Kingdom naturally decreased accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But some things can be thought about, but cannot be said directly. If this is used as an excuse, it is blaming the crown prince and the emperors of the four clans for making mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a subordinate, it is a taboo in the workplace to blame the leader when things happen. What's more, there is nothing wrong with persimmons that are picky and soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the progress of the Alpha Kingdom is slow, the Moxi Principality is making great strides, and now they are attacking the Warhammer Kingdom in a detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the plan is successful, it will be much easier to destroy the Kingdom of Warhammer in one fell swoop, destroy the Principality of Moxi along the way, and then go back to deal with the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it has been fighting the Alpha Kingdom here, and dragging it until the arrival of human reinforcements, that is a major military failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the defenders of the Alpha Kingdom are like smelly and hard stones, and every step forward by the imperial army will pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now there is a problem with the enemy's command system, we will be able to seize the opportunity and tear their defense line in one fell swoop! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abraham's guarantee did not win the appreciation of Emperor Bimon, but instead ushered in a wave of shaking his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You, you still can't change this bad habit!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom was really easy to deal with, it would have been wiped out ten times by the empire long ago, how could it survive until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several high-ranking generals were killed, at most there was only a short period of confusion, and a few lines of defense were thrown at us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From here all the way to Canglan City, there are countless fortresses of all sizes along the way, and a dozen or twenty new lines of defense can be organized casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I led the army to break through Canglan City, I suffered a lot along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But even after taking Canglan City, the Alpha Kingdom still did not collapse, and they moved their capital directly to the south to continue to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So this time we have to change our strategy, we can't push all the way through stupidly, we just need to pick the enemies that should be fought! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bemon's words made Abraham completely confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What is the enemy to fight?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He couldn't find any ideas at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Abraham's inherent concept, all human races are enemies, and there is no distinction between fighting or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Emperor Bimeng didn't seem to notice his doubts, or maybe he didn't care at all, and didn't mean to explain at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon came to the front line in person, and the command of the army naturally changed hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did Abraham want to be obedient, but even the commanders of the armies of the other four tribes were more than a head short in front of this respected old emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five imperial courts, who were fighting independently, unexpectedly realized the unity of military command for a short time in a strange way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon didn't take these changes to heart at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he would not have arrived at the front line so soon, but the plan did not change quickly. I don't know who made a move to help the Orc Empire, so that the opportunity appeared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the last sacrifice, the sacrifices in the secret room have been almost consumed. Judging from the current situation, there is a high probability that the last sacrifice cannot be satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the sacrifices are not enough, it will naturally need to be supplemented. If there is no actual demand, Emperor Bimon would not agree to start a war at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The doom of one hundred thousand years is approaching day by day, which also means that the most dangerous moment is coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continental overlords of all dynasties will take action to clean up the exposed hidden dangers before the disaster strikes, so as to reduce the losses in the calamity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire has jumped out now, which can be said to have put itself in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race is angered, the human race alliance will destroy them first regardless, that would be a real tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the biggest reason why Emperor Beamon dared to launch this war at this time was that the human race was divided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is in the interests of the race, it is not necessarily in the interests of each. In many cases, the interests of individuals will override the interests of the race. This is human nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a unified continental overlord, it is estimated that all the major alien races, including the orcs, are as obedient as little white rabbits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choosing to appear on the battlefield at this moment is actually because Emperor Bimon is deliberately avoiding it, not wanting to be destroyed at a critical moment and all previous efforts to be wasted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle continued, and the wall that could not stand the toss finally collapsed under the **** struggle between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"engineers\" who were doing soil work were reduced to the first wave of sacrifices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the gap made the battle between the two sides more intense. The human magician has been pinned down by the orc priests accompanying the army, and it is difficult to provide much help to the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to plug the gap, countless noble officers led soldiers to make up for it one after another. Unfortunately, the pace of the orc army is still slowly moving forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order. After the army breaks through the city, the human masters will try their best to catch me alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the fiery expression between his brows still revealed his inner desire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone is qualified to be a sacrifice. If it is not a strong person, even if the soul is imprisoned, it will quickly dissipate, and it will not be able to satisfy his needs at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If black hands are used within the Orc Empire, it will not only damage the strength of the empire, but also easily expose the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how secret the secret method is, he can't guarantee that no one will recognize it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news gets out, not only will the plan fail, but even he himself will die with the society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can an emperor who can even kill his own son gain the loyalty of his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, he's going to be shunned by most of the outsiders except for a handful of irons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead, it is easier to operate on the battlefield, catching enemies as sacrifices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone finds out, they can just find an excuse to fool them. For a while, everyone will not think about that aspect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the plan is successful, even if the truth is revealed, Emperor Beamon is not worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world, after all, the law of the jungle preys on the strong, and the strong cannot be blamed. No matter how vicious the method is, everyone will just pretend not to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, the news of the fall of Huaxus province reached here immediately. Caesar III, who was suffering from not being able to find the murderer, had accumulated a full stomach of resentment at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fool!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all a bunch of idiots!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I told them to strengthen their guard against the orcs' sneak attack, but they still let the enemy take advantage of it. It's a shame to the kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the furious king, all the ministers lowered their heads one after another. Ever since Duke Arondo's accident happened, everyone had psychological expectations about the fall of Huaxas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this day came too early. Under normal circumstances, relying on the defenders on the front line, they would be able to deal with the orcs for several months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure after a delay is not a real failure, but a planned \"strategic shift\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Operations similar to \"strategic transfer\" often occurred in the Alpha Kingdom during the period of massive orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the fall of Huaxus province was too fast this time, and the strategic value of exchanging space for time was not able to be exerted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the defenders on the front line have done their best. According to the information collected, Emperor Bimon's camp also appeared in the camp of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old and immortal are all coming to the front line, which is very likely to be a strategic change within the orc empire. Caught off guard, the garrison of Waxas Province was defeated, which is also understandable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he has been really hard these days. The assassination case that caused a sensation in the mainland has yet to find any clues, and Waxas has been lost again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are responsible for organizing and implementing the strategic plan. Now that there has been a major change, this responsibility can only be carried by the Ministry of Military Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to get rid of the blame, and the front-line generals who preside over the defense of Huaxus province do not even have a breather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not your own responsibility, then it can only be the responsibility of the enemy. Although this explanation is not reliable, it is better than nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from Caesar III's expression, he knew that when he heard the word Bimon Huang, his eyelids jumped up habitually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This old opponent can be called the nightmare of the Alpha Kingdom. In the past years, the Alpha Kingdom suffered a lot in order to compete with this old guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isn't that old guy dying, why is he jumping up and down again? Could it be that the Orc Empire really has a life-extending evil method?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the questioning, Caesar III had a slightly unnatural expression. \"Longevity\" is a nightmare for all monarchs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can prolong life, no matter what kind of evil method is not evil method, practicality comes first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Emperor Bimon has passed his 300th birthday. According to historical records, he is already the longest-lived Bimon under the Sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost certain that there is a secret method of life extension in the hands of Emperor Bimon. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, he shouldn't be alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a big trouble, but also a big opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There should be not a few big figures on the mainland who are interested in the secret method of life extension. As long as we release the news, there will be no peace in the second half of Emperor Bimon's life! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is definitely a feeling from the heart. The prime minister is not immune either. As an elderly man, he is also thinking about the method of prolonging his life deep in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I searched hard but couldn't find it, and suddenly I was told the news of the longevity method, and it was almost inevitable to take extraordinary measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bi Menghuang is certainly powerful, but it is not that simple to block the prying eyes of a group of people who are approaching their longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's release the news according to the prime minister's proposal. But it can't be said that it is a method of prolonging life, but directly announce that Emperor Bimeng has obtained the secret method of longevity,\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether Emperor Bimon has the secret method of longevity in his hands, as long as he is alive, this kind of thing cannot be explained clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great people who dream of longevity don't have the time to delve into the truth of the rumors. Anyway, they lived three hundred years longer than Emperor Meng, so they can't be fake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once greed is born, no matter how Emperor Bimon explains it, it will not be able to make everyone feel relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The classic routine of killing with a borrowed knife, although old-fashioned, does not affect its practicality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if only one tenth of the rich and powerful were tempted, the subsequent changes would be more painful than Meng Huang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In recent days, the orc army is indeed gathering in the direction of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horses and weapons and equipment in front of you are the best proof. If it weren't for the orc army to tighten the front line, it would be difficult to transport these things safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is also a credit for the expeditionary force. In recent days, Hudson has not been idle. The six major infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment of the expeditionary force are all fully staffed, and the total strength directly exceeds the 120,000 mark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The extra soldiers are naturally the result of overstaffing. Hudson doesn't like the popular \"soldier + horse\" statistical method. How can a soldier be a soldier and a horse be a horse?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength is as high as 120,000, that is, the real 120,000 people, without the slightest moisture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The source of soldiers and horses, except for the supplement from the Alpha Kingdom and a new army provided by the Mossi, the rest are accumulated by Master Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering up routs and conscripting young men into the army are all routine operations. It can be said that as long as Master Hudson encounters them in the wild, they will be included in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how many spies from other forces there are, Hudson doesn't care. As long as the main officer is his own person, it is enough for ordinary soldiers to trace their origins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fastest replacements on the battlefield are soldiers, who may fall on the battlefield one day, and their original identities will naturally no longer matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The issue of overstaffing troops is a major event in peacetime, but now is a time of war. It's still overstaffed today, maybe tomorrow it won't even be fully organized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the Mosi people like the Expeditionary Force Superman now. Although the expenses are a bit higher, it can bring you a sense of security if you can't stand it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of a person, the shadow of a tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consecutive victories, coupled with the certification of the Orc Empire, Hudson's name has been resounding everywhere in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that hundreds of thousands of expeditionary troops are stationed on the front line of Flying Bear Fort, and the nearby orc troops come out to patrol, and they all take the initiative to detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this news reaches the ears of the Bear King, I don't know if he will regret picking Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Praise kill\", then someone has to kill it. Although many orc generals wanted to take Hudson's head to make their own achievements, this did not include the middle and lower level orc officers and soldiers on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the inside story, but judging only by the record on the surface, I came to the conclusion that Hudson is not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't be provoked, but can be hidden. The orcs also bully the weak and fear the strong, and even because the law of the jungle within the orc empire is more distinct, their awe of the strong is even better than that of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't figure out the strength of the expeditionary army. After the transfer of the bear royal court, the remaining orc army behaved extraordinarily peacefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs obeyed the rules, and Hudson didn't go out to make trouble. The 120,000 expeditionary army seems to be strong and strong, but in fact it can fight only 20,000 to 30,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relax some standards, and there are still 20,000 veterans who have seen blood, which can barely be regarded as semi-elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest are all recruits. Although they have received certain military training, they are still unqualified in Hudson's eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, it must be too late for step-by-step training. Pulling out to fight a few downwind battles is far more effective than dry training for several months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why Hudson readily agreed to the Mosi people and sent troops to break the siege of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Mosi people hold back the main force of the orcs, the more than 300,000 orcs besieging Dapes will be the sharpening stone for his training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, without the main force of the orcs, the defenders in the city could create a passage by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest is a big city, and the encirclement of the orcs is not stable. If there is no highly mobile Beamon Cavalry Legion, there will be loopholes everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defenders in the city are not too weak. As long as Moxi's senior management dares to take risks, they can tear open the encirclement net at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously this does not exist. The king cannot be in charge, it is a group of princes and nobles who make decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there are too many people, it has nothing to do with Guojue. Resolutions that can be approved by most people are usually conservative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They would rather spend a lot of money to invite the expeditionary army to take action than risk the safety of the city of Da Pest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that they have serious distrust of the combat effectiveness of their own army. Even the elite legion is still skeptical in the minds of Moxi's senior management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can be blamed, this cognition is based on the previous record of Moxi's army, a rational judgment made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are elite or not, can't do it just by talking about it, and have to go to the battlefield to perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a record that can be shown, no matter how good the training is, no matter how good the equipment is, it will not be convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson himself, he is also skeptical about the combat effectiveness of the elite army of the Mossi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are worried about their lack of strength, but the main problem is the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the start of the war until now, Moxi's army has been defeated all the way. Occasionally, he rose up, but before he had time to be happy, he was immediately overshadowed by a new defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing one after another, the morale of the army has long since been tossed. If you don't fall into self-doubt, that's a good state of mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This aspect and the expeditionary force are two extremes. Under Hudson's instruction, from the time the recruits stepped into the camp, they had to learn the brilliant achievements of the expeditionary force every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle flag of the Royal Bear Court is even more of an old actor. It has appeared in almost every big camp, for fear that some people don't know the great achievements of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Kettley, these horses will be handed over to you. I want you to train me the cavalry in the shortest possible time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to appreciate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expansion of the cavalry is too fast. Even if they are selected from the whole army, they cannot gather so many soldiers who are skilled in bow and horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not so much cavalry as it is infantry on horseback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they have made preparations in advance, the soldiers have only received some basic cavalry training, and they are still far from becoming qualified cavalrymen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson knows exactly what level his cronies are. It's okay to command the infantry, but the technical arms of the cavalry still need professionals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, the number of cavalry was small, and Hudson could command it himself. Now support the expansion into an army, and then put him under the direct control of the commander-in-chief, the workload will be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire expeditionary force, there are very few who are capable of serving as regiment commanders, and even fewer are able to command the cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose Baron Kettley, besides holding his handle, the most important thing is to be familiar with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, in the case of the cavalry corps, it will take at least three months before they can go into battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, we will bully the orc infantry at most. If you encounter the Beamon Cavalry Legion, I'm afraid there is nothing you can do! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately said rather nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally getting the high position of army commander, the first task arranged by the boss encountered trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a secret in the expeditionary force that the Mosi people want to launch a battle to break the siege of Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leak of the news had nothing to do with Hudson. It was mainly because the Moxi people themselves did not know how to keep it secret, which made the news spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a war of this level, anyone with a little military common sense would know that the expeditionary force would not be able to watch from the sidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, you don't need to deal with the large group of Beamon cavalry, the Moxi people will take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really encounter it on the battlefield, you only need to consider being able to deal with one or two enemies of the Beamon cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it exceeds this limit, then you don't need to fight them, just avoid them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has high hopes for this cavalry team. It is absolutely impossible to pay for it before it has played a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly confronting the Beamon Cavalry Legion is what the Knights should do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One wave is not flat, and another wave rises again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after the task was assigned and all the weapons and equipment were distributed, a piece of news from the country shocked Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many places on the northern border fell, and the originally stable Alpha Kingdom unexpectedly experienced turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the preparations were sufficient, and after losing a large area of ​​land, the battle situation was quickly stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation improved before he was sent to notify him. It was clear that he was worried that the news would spread, causing the expeditionary army to be unstable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the bad news of the defeat on the front line, the rumor that Emperor Bimeng possessed the \"secret method of longevity\" had a greater impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In almost an instant, the bad news of the frontline defeat was covered up, attracting the attention of countless people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The topic of \"Longevity\" attracts people in any world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson couldn't help being moved after hearing the news for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is an iron fact that Emperor Bimon lived to be over three hundred years old, and his lifespan far exceeds that of a normal Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there are two explanations: either Emperor Bimeng broke through the sanctuary secretly and greatly increased his lifespan; or he really has life extension or the secret method of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The possibility of the former is very small. There is no way to hide such a big movement of breaking through the sanctuary, and there is no need to hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the second case, whether it is the secret method of prolonging life or the secret method of longevity, it is worth everyone's peeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for being young and having plenty of longevity, Hudson wasn't sure if he could resist the temptation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I am like this, those old guys who are dying of life, I am afraid it will be even more difficult to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is certain that there will be a bloodiest battle surrounding Emperor Bimon next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe not only human masters, maybe even strong aliens will participate. After all, no one would dislike their longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of who sent the news, it is a naked conspiracy. Even knowing that someone is deliberately creating enemies for Emperor Bimon, it can't stop everyone from thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After weighing the pros and cons, Hudson finally suppressed the idea of ​​joining in the fun. Everything is focused on the overall situation of fighting the orcs, and it is definitely not that he is cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the province of Atreus, the decisive battle that will determine the future fate of the Warhammer Kingdom has begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathered all the troops that could be mobilized in the kingdom. Not only was Joseph II not in high spirits, but his hairline kept moving back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II didn't know whether a large number of soldiers was strong in combat effectiveness; but the difficulty of commanding with a large number of soldiers definitely increased dramatically, but he realized it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first and most direct problem we face is the logistics of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 700,000 troops have been gathered one after another. Even if they don't do anything, just eating and drinking every day is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is no longer a question of whether the nobles of the Atreus province cooperate. The point is that even if every household opened their warehouses, they would not be able to gather enough strategic materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, the orc army split up and attacked our granary? Tens of thousands of tons of grain and grass materials were set on fire by the enemy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to raise this batch of strategic materials, he had exhausted his painstaking efforts, but in the end he was directly wiped out by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of supplies is not a big deal, the key is that the army needs to eat! Fortunately, at the critical moment, he was cautious and did not store all the supplies together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs replied with a livid face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is a failing answer sheet. Unfortunately, the papers have already been handed in, and there is no possibility of modifying the grades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because he felt that his answer was too abrupt and could not be forgiven by the king, Thiago hurried forward and explained:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the orc army is coming too fast. The soldiers guarding the warehouse are all logistics personnel with low combat effectiveness in the kingdom. They can't react to the enemy's surprise attack at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning. The enemy has now divided up their forces, and they are obviously not going to fight us directly. Our logistical pressure will continue to increase. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all true. If the orc army is so divided, the original decisive battle plan will be directly scrapped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those with two legs cannot catch up with those with four legs. When the orc army is active, it will definitely continue to do things. Next, the situation of the Warhammer Kingdom will become even more dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all a bunch of trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why didn't you notice such a big thing as the division of the orc army in advance? You have to wait for the enemy to do something before you know how to report it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't have enough training, it's that the battle report is too ridiculous. It was only when the granary was raided that they reported the news, which was obviously a dereliction of duty by the guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the troops below made a mistake, the Ministry of Military Affairs is naturally to blame, and it is not wrong to be scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the incident happened too suddenly. It is meaningless to pursue responsibility now. The top priority is to solve the threat of orcs as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the materials lost earlier, we can also find a way to deploy some materials from other places for emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the nearby legions, who may have to tighten their belts and live a hard life for a while. The influence of others is not very great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if there is another mistake in the future, it will be really troublesome. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Gay analyzed rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding a problem does not mean solving it. Just when the high-level leaders of the Warhammer Kingdom were worried about the division of the orcs, the dispersed orc army also took action one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looting the material warehouse is just one of the routine operations. He robbed the convoy, attacked the patrols, and occasionally broke through a few camps, but he didn't fight them...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It was with his negative teaching material that the dignitaries of various countries realized \"again\" that war requires professionals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to arrange children, you must first check your ability, not just arrange the position based on birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Invisibly, many small and medium-sized nobles have left opportunities. Otherwise, the position of commander-in-chief would not have fallen so easily to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coaches all take advantage of this east wind to rise to the top, and the generals below are no exception. In the past, only nobles above the viscount served as the head of the legion, but now there are not only barons, but even the head of the knight legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is mainly due to the particularity of the expeditionary force. No second-generation children came to pick peaches, so these personnel appointments were able to pass smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is left in the country, if the little noble wants to get up, he has to go through battles again and again and accumulate enough prestige before he can be promoted exceptionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long this kind of good life will last, no one can tell. After all, the greatest lesson humans can learn from history is to never learn anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unity of the nobles was forced out. Once the situation improves, they will immediately fall into internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the towering city wall with nostalgia, and looking at the green vegetable fields, Hudson knew that leaving this time might be a farewell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the frowning officers who were sending off, he didn't know how to comfort them, so he could only let these people ask for their own blessings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that two legions have been added to change defenses, but everyone knows that the Flying Bear Fort without the expeditionary army is almost like an ordinary military fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's only a matter of time before the orc army makes a comeback. The vegetable fields outside the city can only be harvested in one wave, and there is no hope for the follow-up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not everyone can scare off the orcs with their reputation. Maybe the wronged Xiongren imperial court will take revenge on the new defenders for the suffering they suffered from the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't take down the Expeditionary Army, can you still not take down the two Mosi Legions?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the internal affairs of the Principality of Moxi, and Hudson has no ability to intervene. No matter how difficult the next task of guarding Flying Bear's Fort is, someone has to guard it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving this nail can make the orcs feel uncomfortable, which is the greatest value of the existence of Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Set off!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by Hudson's order, the army marched in orderly steps and embarked on the journey mightily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chilling aura coming to the face seemed to be silently telling: This is an elite division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hundred and fifty miles away, the Bearman Royal Court, who had just transferred from the Bethel area, immediately received the news that the expeditionary force was leaving the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy has finally come out. Tell the other four imperial courts that everything is going according to plan and let them speed up. This time, the enemy cannot be allowed to slip away again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the five orc kings, the last expedition to the joint battalion, although the actual loss caused was not a big deal, the insult it caused was huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though things have passed for so long, the political influence has not faded away. Every time everyone mentions the Expeditionary Army, they always bring the background board of the Royal Court of the Bearman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has essentially become a thorn in his side and a thorn in his flesh. It is really hard to dispel his hatred if he does not destroy the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the common drive of hatred and interests, there is a big net laid by the five imperial courts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only to destroy the expeditionary force, but also to take away the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi in one wave, and establish the glorious victory of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bait has been put down, the previous plan was very successful, and the next step is to test the actual operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the city of Dapace, in the camp of the orc army. Seeing the information from the Eagle scouts, Prince Butzweig smiled coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To break the siege of Dapez, it would involve the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops, so it is naturally impossible to do it in one go. If the army is to gather from all over the world, it is simply impossible to achieve complete synchronization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Mosi people were prepared in their hearts, after ordering the troops from all over the country to move closer, they marched towards the city of Dapes in a group, but in the eyes of Prince Butzweig, there were still flaws everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three elite infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments, plus five knight regiments, and 15 new regiments, plus seven expeditionary regiments, the total strength exceeds 350,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not counting the defenders in the city of Dapace. If all of them are added up, I'm afraid it's not far from 500,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are enemy troops everywhere in the south, north, east, and west. The Moxi people really think highly of us! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig's words caused the generals to roar with laughter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many soldiers and generals, but they can't scare the Bimon Army. In the last Dacias battle, the human race also had an absolute advantage in strength, but they were still scattered and fled in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of enemy troops is larger this time, but the strength in their hands is also much more than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, the enemy is gathering an army, and we can't just watch and do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just taking advantage of their busy time, defeating the army along the way first is a big gift for them! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greg couldn't help but suggest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon, who was born for war, has never been afraid of war, they only worry about the absence of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the high-level Beamon being sober enough to suppress the warlike desires of the people below, I'm afraid they are either fighting or on the way to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Greg, your proposal is very good. The process of gathering the enemy army is indeed a good opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the more opportunities appear in front of you, the more rational you must be. If we can see the problem, so can the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who can guarantee that this is not a loophole deliberately released by the enemy, just to lure us into taking the bait? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark, who turned his mouth against him, was a think tank recruited by Prince Butzweig. In the past years, he has made many suggestions and is deeply trusted by the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then according to our Viscount Clark, just look at it like this now and do nothing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greg mocked pretending to be annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Civil and military lines are two lines, it is impossible without conflict. As a general who was killed from the army with real swords and guns, Greg really looked down on this kind of lip service.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark had already seen the scene in front of him. Greg didn't like a counselor like him, and he never liked this kind of \"reckless man\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really wanted to gain prestige in the army, Clark had plenty of opportunities. The problem is that he is Prince Butzweig's staff and think tank first, and his position in the army is only second.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to show off is naturally left to the coach. How can there be someone who is an aide and steals the show, and is dedicated to making achievements for himself?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duty is the main reason why he is so trusted. Otherwise, he is a fox-human race, how can he be qualified to sit here and discuss with a group of Bimons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Commander Greg, we will definitely fight. But there are enemies on all sides, so we have to pick a target, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the expeditionary force that just came from the north. If we attack them, we won't be able to eat them for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long delay, the human army from all over the place gathered, and the army that besieged Da Pest City was in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice now is to pick a weaker human army first to attack the morale of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the next battle, it is best to wait for domestic reinforcements to arrive before fighting a decisive battle with the human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A pit was dug down so lightly. He has basically said everything that can be said, no matter how Greg responds next, he will inevitably step into the trap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sipping coldly and expressing his dissatisfaction, Greg turned his head directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience told him, don't argue with lip service, it means disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to use fists. If you can't agree with each other, you should be beaten up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all hang out with Prince Butzweig, and they have to give the boss some face. This kind of thing must not be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let's stop here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether this is the enemy's flaw or a trap they deliberately left behind, we must fight this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mr. Clark is right, the expeditionary force should be the strongest among these human armies. With only our main army, it is difficult to eat them in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy in the west is very close to the expeditionary army. If we attack them, it will easily turn into an encirclement of the two armies against us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is the enemies in the south. Although they have the largest number, most of them are recruits. There are only two knights and one infantry regiment with a little fighting power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as our speed is fast enough, we can completely defeat the enemy army before they gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Head of the Guards, send a message to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, the fish has already been hooked, and ask him to urge the empire to send reinforcements as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said with a wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The understatement failed to cover up the unnaturalness between the brows. Obviously, as the bait of this plan, he still felt the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the Mongolian cavalry, the combat effectiveness of the human army is indeed low. But he couldn't stand the large number of human troops, but he only had one Beamon cavalry army in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout the ages, there have been more battles in which ants kill elephants, but far more than the classic battles in which fewer wins more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how elite your army is, you must be cautious when facing an enemy army ten times larger than your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the enemies this time are not all mobs. The elite army of the human race is not as good as the Beamon army, but it is still possible to entangle them for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the battle is not settled quickly and turns into a long war of attrition, the party with the disadvantaged force will be a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, a group of princes and nobles are busy making strategic deployments. Even the news of the secret method of longevity did not arouse the slightest disturbance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't have the desire to live forever, on the contrary, it's because their desire to survive is so strong that they don't have the mind to think about these illusory things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good longevity is, you have to survive first before you are qualified to talk about this topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The expeditionary force has already set out, and armies from all over the Principality are also in action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, the Ministry of Military Affairs asked the troops to suppress the marching speed to 30 miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge communicated with Earl Hudson that the expeditionary force will act as a vanguard to attract the attention of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, according to the agreement, it is the principality army that is ultimately responsible for the decisive battle with the Beamon Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the marching speed of the expeditionary force, they are currently about 150 miles away from the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, let's see if the orcs fall for it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins said solemnly, as if everything was under control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone present is a veteran of the political arena, and they immediately understood the meaning behind the words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds nice to suppress the marching speed at 30 miles per day, but the real situation is that the fastest marching speed of the army is at this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force is responsible for attracting the attention of the orcs. In other words: the current expeditionary force is the closest to the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing language arts, Martins is also forced. As the Minister of Military Affairs of the Principality, he can't just say that his army's performance is unqualified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this is the truth, it must be covered up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if it spreads out and causes turmoil in the hearts of the people, it will be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the slow progress of the army is mainly dragged down by the new army. The main army is still good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Martins, these main armies have just been supplemented. Can they entangle the Beamon army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the Principality of Moxi is pulling the hips, it's mainly because the early battles lost too many elites, so that there is no follow-up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the loss of the main force, it took a lot of time to rest and replenish at the rear, and the city of Dapace would not be so easily besieged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, I think the problem now is not how to entangle the Beamon cavalry, but how to intercept the orc reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a Beamon Cavalry Legion, plus a group of cannon fodder troops, wants to besiege the city of Dapace. I don't think a normal commander can think of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is clear that it is the bait released, deliberately attracting our main force to come to the decisive battle, but the Principality has no way to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the competition is about patience and speed. Whoever can't bear to make mistakes first will be more likely to be eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom is the best example. It tried to preserve its strength in the previous battles, but now it is time to pay the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force of the Orc Empire has disturbed their rear. Gathered hundreds of thousands of troops, but was still led by the nose by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the situation in the principality is critical, we still have reinforcements. The advance troops of the Terran Alliance have already set off and will arrive in the spring of next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what I need is to buy time. No matter what kind of battle, everything is about gaining time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no positive answer, sometimes it is negative. The facts are right in front of you, and it cannot be diverted by personal will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins, who is familiar with the Principality's army, knows very well that the key to entangle the Beamon cavalry is not the performance of his own cavalry, but more depends on whether the enemy cooperates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all high-mobility troops. As long as the Beamon cavalry wants to run, no one can stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only knights who can compete with them head-on, the number is too small. Moreover, these troops belong to different families, and no one can say for sure how much combat effectiveness the temporary cooperation can exert.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not sure about tactics, then you can make up for it with a strategic victory. Their core task is to delay time and reconcile the siege of Dapes. The success or failure of one or two battles is not the key.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passively became the forward of the whole army, Hudson, who knew nothing, still marched step by step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army gathered in Dapace City from all directions, no matter how the orcs chose, they could only attack in one direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persimmons are picky, Hudson believes that with his name, there is a high probability that he will not be that unlucky guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order to go on, the detective horse will expand the detection range by ten miles, and the heavy infantry will be divided into three groups and take turns to serve as the front army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience is summed up, self-confidence is self-confidence, Hudson still can't guarantee that the commander on the opposite side must be smart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of encountering a naive general, they will choose the famous one to stand up, and the expeditionary force is the first target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instances in this regard have never been uncommon in history. Many single-minded generals are often able to achieve unexpected results, mainly because the opposing generals miscalculated the hearts of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the purpose of war is to play with people's hearts, it needs people to have it. When encountering a single-minded enemy, no matter how you set up a suspicious formation, they will directly overwhelm them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the order was issued, the Griffin Cavalry, who were responsible for monitoring the movements of the Beamon Cavalry remotely, landed in front of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the Beamon Legion of the orcs has moved. The direction of their troops is just opposite to ours.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the news, Hudson's first reaction was that a fighter plane appeared. Just considering the distance between the two sides, he had to suppress this tempting thought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the nearest orc is no less than one hundred and forty miles away from the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a long-distance raid, I don't know if I can seize the opportunity, but I must be tossed and useless first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are expensive on the battlefield. If you want to take advantage of the opportunity of the Beamon cavalry to go out to attack the camp, the best choice is cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the cavalry corps of the Expeditionary Army has just completed expansion and has not yet formed an army. It can only be regarded as an elite cavalry infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry combat and infantry combat are still different after all. Hudson didn't know exactly how powerful the Cavalry Legion was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking a cavalry corps of unknown combat effectiveness to attack the camp of hundreds of thousands of orcs, Hudson's mind is not broken yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of fighter is better left to the Mosi people. The army on the road must not be able to catch up, but the army in the city can make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be difficult to tear apart the encirclement net, but it is still possible to take advantage of the opportunity and boost morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if thinking of something, Hudson suddenly ordered: \"Send the order to set up roadblocks on the road behind the army, especially dig more horse pits on the main road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave horse scouts along the way, and if you find the traces of the orc army, immediately ignite the wolf smoke. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It was a temporary emergency mobilization, and there were not so many cotton-padded clothes prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the nobles should prepare their own clothes for the private army. However, the southern provinces of the principality have a tropical climate, so there is no need for cotton coats in winter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will naturally be no reserves for things that are not needed. Even after receiving the mobilization order, everyone worked hard to raise money, but it was still a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of insufficient supplies, priority must be given to the main force, and ordinary soldiers can only rely on shaking to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to change into a cotton coat, Earl Fidelis could only sigh helplessly. Just as he was about to get on his horse, his eyes suddenly changed, and he suddenly raised his head to look at the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the blue sky and white clouds, a little gray shadow spread its wings and hovered, like an eagle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, by visual inspection, it was slightly larger than ordinary eagles, and the hovering movements seemed a bit weird. After circling several times directly above the army, it turned over and danced a few times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Fidelis's already ugly face became more and more gloomy, and the young officer next to him said in a panic: \"Father, it's Eagleman...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the young man could finish speaking, Earl Fidelis slapped him on the back of the head and reprimanded him: \"Shut up! I saw it too. Isn't it the Eagle Scout, what's the fuss about!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it lightly, but deep down he was not at all relaxed. After a little hesitation, Earl Fidelis immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the Griffin Cavalry take off to investigate, but don't entangle with the enemy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and the number of Griffin cavalry was seriously insufficient, so they could only save a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is another air battle with Yingman, maybe even the last seed will be killed one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc scouts have all appeared, and the distance between the two sides is not far away. Turning to the officer next to him, he asked, \"How long has it been since the scouts we sent didn't report back?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The last message I received was last night.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officer replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get a map!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Earl Fidelis's voice fell, the adjutant next to him immediately took the map from his back and unfolded it, and sent it to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding the location of the army on the map, Earl Fidelis suddenly changed his face and said gloomyly: \"Oops...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the words were finished, the griffin cavalry who had just taken off were in trouble first. It turned out that the performance of the previous Eagle Man in the air was to send a signal, calling for his companions to come over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unexpected encounter laid the foundation for the outbreak of the encounter. The few griffin cavalry did not dare to entangle with the enemy in the air, and hurriedly got rid of the eagle chasers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that, the investigation mission was also wasted. Facing the large number of Eaglemen, the Griffin Cavalry could only back away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Earl Fidelis, who was in a panic, pretended to be calm and said: \"The number of scouts going out to investigate has tripled.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the distant field, a Beamon cavalry is galloping wildly, and you can feel a powerful evil spirit blowing towards your face from a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jorge is an old scout who has fought with the coach for many years. He has seen big scenes, but he was still stunned by the scene in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the enemy approaching, Jorge slapped his head when he reacted, lit the wolf smoke and threw it on the ground, turned around and ran away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a veteran's emergency response. It was too late to go back and report the news, and at the speed of the Beamon cavalry, everyone was able to work on their feet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accurate information cannot be transmitted back, so the only way to light the special beacon in hand is to remind the coach behind to be careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Jorge reacted quickly, the Beamon cavalry still caught him after such a momentary delay. Just less than a mile away, he was overtaken by the strong Bimon and killed him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jorge's sacrifice was not in vain. Although the Beamon cavalry quickly took measures to extinguish the smoke, the rising smoke still attracted the attention of colleagues more than ten miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another, the smoke of the war, distributed in a grid pattern, was passed to the army after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong, Earl Fidelis groaned secretly. There is a flat river in the vicinity for tens of miles, and the only thing that can be regarded as a fortification is a baron's castle one mile away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the defensive capabilities of the castle, a small baronial castle can't hold so many troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Earl Fidelis immediately ordered: \"Send the order and turn to Ellenburg.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to have fortifications than not to have them. Relying on the castle to camp, at least the materials can be placed in the castle to ensure that the logistics will not be destroyed by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Earl Fidelis had already prayed secretly: what he encountered was not the Beamon Cavalry Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountering Beamon cavalry in the wild is a nightmare for all generals. Even with an advantage in military strength, Earl Fidelis has no confidence in winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best result is to rely on the army formation to force back the Beamon cavalry. Let's forget about the head-on confrontation. It is not easy for the family to build a knight order, so he is reluctant to spend it here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What to fear, what to do, the army had just arrived at Fort Allente, and there was a report: \"Your Excellency, there is a large group of Beamon cavalry ahead, the number is very large, and they are all over the place.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of vocabulary makes Tanma unable to find a more suitable adjective! There can only be one sentence everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number of troops?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the scouts simply don't have time to count. The speed of Beamon, who was galloping wildly, was top-notch, a little bit slower, and he was not even qualified to report back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, when the scouts sent back the specific news, the ground had already begun to tremble, and a looming black spot appeared in the distant sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Arrange to meet the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Fidelis was still secretly thankful while giving the order: Fortunately, he was cautious enough to take emergency measures immediately after receiving the beacon warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If an unprepared encounter with the Beamon cavalry in the wild, I am afraid that it will directly stage a farce that is about to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the **** killing began. Without any dialogue, even the generals of both sides did not show up, and the battle broke out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crossbow arrow salvo!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Archers ready, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Spear thrower ready, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orderly command did not prevent the Beamon cavalry from attacking. The armor covering the whole body prevented a large number of arrows for the charging Beamon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Beamon Heavy Cavalry\", just as the idea was born, the military formation on the edge was already torn apart by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him made Count Fidelis frowned. The elite in hand is limited, and it is impossible to take into account all positions, and it is inevitable that the enemy will find a loophole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to prohibit anyone from retreating. The supervising team is in charge of supervision. Anyone who disturbs the formation will be shot to death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order was timely, but in the face of the collapsed situation, it was still futile. No matter how powerful the supervising team is, it can't stop the speed of the army's collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once wanted to order the knights around him to attack and stop the Beamon cavalry, but in the end Earl Fidelis gave up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Saved the collapsed situation, and his own Knights were gone. What's more, if you can stop the Beamon cavalry once, you can't stop the second time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel reality told him that taking a large number of recruits on the road together was the biggest mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the battle still had to continue, and the mere partial collapse of the battlefield was not enough to make Earl Fidelis give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The battle here won't end for a while. Kevin, find an opportunity to break out and send the news back to the capital. Let them seize the opportunity and immediately launch a big battle to force the Beamon cavalry to return to aid!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said it easily, but in his heart, Earl Fidelis was not at all sure. Armies from all over the country are on the road, and reinforcements are simply too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only way is: the cavalry attack and the defenders in the city of Dapes should cooperate with each other, and attack the orc army besieging the king's capital together, forcing the Beamon cavalry to return to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a life-and-death race, whoever ends the battle first will be the winner of this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, but...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Kevin could express his worries, Earl Fidelis interrupted: \"Not so many, but this is an order!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now all you have to do is—execute! Everything else has nothing to do with you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time when the war broke out, the five royal courts of the orcs also started a war on the border one after another. The original strategy of moving westward was just a cover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught off guard, many border fortresses were defeated in one battle, and Terence City, which was struggling to hold on, also became crumbling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the sudden deterioration of the situation, Marshal Hodge could only look up at the sky speechlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the defenders are weak, it's that the enemy is playing too much. They had just mobilized troops from the front line to go back to break the siege of Dapace, when they encountered an onslaught of orcs. It was obvious that the enemy was well prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal situation, even if the orcs were fishing with the army besieging the city of Dapace, at this time they should send a large army across the defense line for reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the strategy to relieve the siege of Dapes, Marshal Hodge specially arranged troops to stop the orc army on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan didn't change quickly, and the orc didn't play cards according to common sense at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan to besiege the Warhammer Kingdom with internal and external cooperation was temporarily cancelled, and the army in deep danger ignored it, and wanted to pull out these \"nail houses\" with all their heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of troops have been withdrawn, and now is exactly the time when Terence's defense line is weakest. Apart from watching the fortresses fall, Marshal Hodge found that he could do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, he suddenly understood. From beginning to end, the goal of the orcs was the hundreds of thousands of defenders on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these troops, the Principality of Moxi would be abolished. Even if the siege of Dapace is lifted, it cannot stop the reality of decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to see through the conspiracy. If you don't seize this opportunity to launch a siege battle, then the plan to storm the city of Dapace will become a reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the city of Dapace falls, for the Principality of Moxi, what will be lost is not only the capital, but also hope and faith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the frontline army will become a lone army. Not only will the morale of the army be severely damaged, but all logistical supplies will also be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is a large amount of food and grass stored in the city in advance, there will always be a day when it will be exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with food and grass, what is more troublesome is the supplies for defending the city. Daily battles consume a lot of energy, and the reserves in the city alone won't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of absolute strength, it is not possible to turn things around by planning alone. The reality facing the Moxi people is that no matter what they choose, the final outcome will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back in the direction of the capital, Marshal Hodge secretly made up his mind. If it is unable to reverse the general trend of the principality's continuous decline, it must buy as much time as possible for the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every day Terence's defense lasted, the main force of the orcs could be restrained for one more day. After paying such a heavy price, if the siege of Dapace cannot be solved, the Principality of Moxi will be completely desolate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom is also suffering along with it. The previous changes in the frontline orc army forced the defenders not to act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they saw the main force of the orc army turn around, they still didn't dare to send troops back to reinforce the battlefield of Atruss, lest the enemy would make a feint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is no shortage of people on the battlefield of Atreus. What they lack is the elite knights who can confront the orc cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a kingdom, the Warhammer Kingdom has a stronger family background than the Moxi Principality, but this wealth is also quite limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population is large and the territory is large, but it cannot support the Warhammer Kingdom. A large amount of land is mountainous, and the land on the plains is not as fertile as the Principality of Moxi. The gap in financial resources between the two countries is not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poverty produces strong soldiers, but poverty cannot produce knights. Limited by financial resources, there are not even many cavalry regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the soldiers were more resilient, facing the orc cavalry rushing around, they could only look at and sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by food and grass accidents again and again, Joseph II's anger is also increasing day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The granaries of the nobles in the vicinity were almost emptied by the army. If this continues, everyone will starve sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no evacuation, even if Joseph II is willing, the surrounding orc army will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also drunk, the 700,000 army is actually restricted by the 90,000 orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the strictly guarded camp, the orc army was powerless. But once they set off, the orc cavalry will rush up immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they are marching together in an army formation. Obviously, this is impossible. What kind of army formation can hold a 700,000 army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the formation is formed, there is no way to move forward in an orderly manner. A plain does not mean that all the land is on the same horizon. It also has ups and downs, but it is relatively flat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you found the location of the orc infantry?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had a choice, he would never come to personally command the army again. This kind of passive battle is really frustrating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment when the army gathered in the province of Atreus, they were led by the nose all the way, as if they were walking a dog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several times of taking the initiative to attack, not only did not smash the enemy's conspiracy, but accompanied two cavalry regiments, and four knight regiments suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the record obtained is only good according to the subordinates. Anyway, let everyone attack later, and each of them pushes back and forth, as if the attack is going to the execution ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it's confirmed. A large group of bear infantry was found stationed in Fort Yakron, fifty miles away from us.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged general replied hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this information, they also spent a lot of effort. Nearly a hundred scouts paid with their lives for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that human life on the battlefield is worthless, and the average daily casualties exceed four digits. Everyone has long been numb to numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fifty miles is still a bit far away. But with the current situation, I can't take care of that much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, tell the senior officers to come over and discuss the battle plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said with a slightly dignified expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc cavalry has taken the initiative on the battlefield. The longer the time drags on, the more unfavorable the situation will be for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take the initiative to find fighters for a decisive battle, you will be dragged behind and the army will run out of food, and you will not be able to fight if you want to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if the orc cavalry didn't harass their food roads, they wouldn't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mobilizing 700,000 troops at one time seems to be very majestic, but the logistical pressure it brings is also beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The province of Atreus is located in the middle of the kingdom. It is not the preset battlefield at all, and no material reserves have been made in advance. All the consumption of the army depends on temporary fundraising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problems facing the Warhammer Kingdom include not only the logistics of the army, but also the large number of refugees brought about by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, this time the orc army suddenly changed its nature, instead of committing a tragic massacre, it drove the serfs away instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees in one city and one place can be resettled by the Warhammer Kingdom. But when the people in several southern provinces became refugees, it became an unsolvable problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relief cannot come, it can only be suppressed. Many areas in the Warhammer Kingdom have been reduced to **** on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, Joseph II was also in a dilemma. The outcome of the Battle of Atrus will directly affect the future fate of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Retreating, not only would there be a risk of the entire army being defeated, but the situation in the central provinces would also fall in an all-round way; fighting, not only would they not be able to wipe out the orc army, but they would be led by the nose by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is to grab the infantry in the orc army and beat them hard, lure the enemy cavalry to help, and look for opportunities to severely injure the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two wars ushered in the choice of fate at the same time. Hudson, who knew nothing, led the army to set off for the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What troubled him was that there were suddenly more eagle men in the sky, which made it impossible for his own griffin cavalry to go out to investigate normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to drive away this group of annoying ghosts, Bear Stearns has already attacked several times, which made the cub look at him full of resentment, as if complaining about his abuse of child labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told Hudson that the more the enemy is unwilling to let them do something, the more they will do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Eagles were dispatched wantonly just to block the airspace and prevent the Griffon Cavalry from going out to investigate. Something big must happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While hesitating, Hudson's face immediately changed when the wolf smoke rose from behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Black smoke billows, the orcs are attacking Terence's line of defense!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson understood. The orcs deliberately showed their flaws this time, not to engage in a siege battle under the city of Dapes, but to attack the frontline defenders of Terence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Orc Empire, compared with conquering Dapes City, it is obviously a vital force to annihilate the Principality of Moxi, and has more strategic value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing it, Hudson still has no idea of ​​returning to Terrance's defense. It's not a question of whether you want to, but simply can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way here, I was worried that the orc army would sneak up on the back road, and the expeditionary army was wreaking havoc along the way. The current main road is full of potholes, which is not suitable for large army operations at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to go back, you must first repair the road. Everyone knows that destruction is easier than construction, relying on the free play of the vast number of soldiers, how much damage can be caused, you can only ask the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to speed up the march! Within two days, we must rush to the city of Da Pest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told Hudson that now is not the time to preserve his strength. If you can't take advantage of the opportunity of the Beamon cavalry's departure and lift the siege of Dapez first, the situation will be even worse later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early in the morning, Haiyue will be updated, Piao Piao is walking\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Unless the alchemy technology is further improved, there is no possibility of promotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a city under heavy siege, losing contact with the outside world is undoubtedly very dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as they noticed something was wrong, the high-level officials of the principality hurriedly sent people out of the city to contact the troops from all over the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We got in touch, but the situation is a bit bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the southern provinces led by Earl Fidelis were attacked by the Beamon Army and are currently holding their ground at Fort Allente.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other armies did not encounter any trouble, but we got bad news from the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Army, that the orcs are attacking Terence's defense line with all their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exact circumstances are unknown, but Lord Hudson advised us to prepare for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the expeditionary force has accelerated its speed, and it is expected to arrive the day after tomorrow, and we should cooperate with us inside and outside to tear apart the orcs' encirclement of Dapes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins said with a slightly panicked expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more trouble you have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others have not realized the seriousness of the problem, but he, the Minister of Military Affairs, is very clear that the situation facing the principality will become more and more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three northern countries encountered troubles almost at the same time, and they couldn't find anyone to ask for help. The collapse of any one of them would deal a major blow to the other two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neighboring countries nearby, it is okay to ask them to support some supplies, and there is no need to embarrass others when sending troops to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if countries can send reinforcements, Earl Martins doesn't know how to use them. If the group is accidentally destroyed, it will be a great debt of favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to reverse the situation, you have to wait for reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance to arrive. But the prerequisite is that they can persist for such a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can the Light Expeditionary Army and the defenders of Dapace defeat the enemies who besiege us?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg asked rather anxiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the sequelae of old defeats. After a series of wars, everyone lacks confidence in their own army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It shouldn't be a big problem, Earl Hudson is not a reckless person, and he must have a certain degree of confidence in daring to propose this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are 300,000 orc army outside the city, they are all the cannon fodder army of the orc empire, and their combat effectiveness is very average.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current total strength of the expeditionary force has also exceeded 120,000. Perhaps they can defeat the orc army outside the city without our intervention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to be on the safe side, it's better to send some more troops over. The infantry couldn't catch up, but the cavalry came rushing over and it was not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only suspense is whether the Beamon Legion of the orcs will return to aid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, we have two cavalry regiments, plus the new cavalry regiment of the Expeditionary Army, and a few knight regiments. It should not be a big problem to entangle them for a while. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins analyzed rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have no confidence in myself, but I have full confidence in outsiders. I have to say this is a kind of irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality is before our eyes. In the previous battle, the army of the Principality of Moxi did not perform up to standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After going through the most difficult early stage of the war, the situation has improved, but under the conservative strategy of Marshal Hodge, there is still no record that can be achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just defending the line of defense, or losing both sides in field encounters, such a record obviously cannot reverse the adverse effects caused in the early stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This deep lack of self-confidence has directly affected the strategic formulation of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were replaced by a group of confident commanders, the Beamon cavalry would take military action as soon as they left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they don't directly lead the defenders to fight out, they will arrange for troops to take the opportunity to rob the camp, instead of just sitting back and watching the situation change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you have no other disagreements, then go ahead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urge the alliance. The current situation, I always feel a little abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The immortal Emperor Bimon came to the front line in person, and tore apart two lines of defense as soon as he came up. The Alpha Kingdom is also in turmoil now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Warhammer Kingdom was even worse. Joseph II led an army of one million, but he couldn't do anything to an expeditionary army of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if their actual strength is only half of the declared strength, there are still 500,000 troops. With so many troops pinned down and unable to move, sooner or later there will be big problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows the situation of the principality, if the enemy's siege of Dapas is not broken as soon as possible, the next thing is...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the words came to his lips, Prime Minister Herceg swallowed them back. The morale was not high at first, and it would be completely gone after a few more blows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pessimistic sentiment spread among the principality's senior management. In addition to the deteriorating situation, it is also related to the changes in the principality's senior management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lacking the backbone of the king, Prime Minister Herceg is not a strong minister. No matter what decision is made, everyone discusses and votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This way of handling is steady, but it always gives people a very reluctant feeling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi urgently needs a big victory to stabilize the turbulent hearts in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resolving the siege of Dapace is not necessarily the best decision at the moment, but it must be the most effective choice in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear's Castle, since the expeditionary force withdrew, it has been attacked by the bear court most violently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossbow arrows, trebuchets, magic crystal cannons, and magic bullets flew all over the sky, and all the firepower greeted the defenders on the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the Xiongrenhuang is going to vent all the grievances he has suffered before on this castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of aggressive attack, which spared no expense, brought great psychological pressure to the defenders from the very beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal cannon on the city wall kept ringing, and the bed crossbows and trebuchets kept firing downward, but the Flying Bear Castle was just a fortress after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the entire Royal Bear Court, all the firepower on the Moxi battlefield is still at a disadvantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, before the outbreak of the war, who would have thought that the royal court of the orcs would spend such a high price to storm a military fortress?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the offensive is really going to be so fierce, it should be directed at Terence City, the hub of the defense line, rather than Flying Bear Castle, which has a second-class strategic position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure it shouldn't have, the ancient Flying Bear Castle wept in the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the overwhelming offensive of the orc army, if it weren't for being trapped in an isolated city with no way out, the defenders would have collapsed long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now this is just an appetizer, the real **** battle is after the city is broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom, boom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A loud bang continued to come out, and after each explosion, a city wall would collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on, why hasn't the enemy's city wall been torn apart?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang, who was watching the battle, asked with a puzzled face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the enemy has thickened the city walls. Even if we bury the magic bullets specially designed to break the city under the city walls, we cannot tear them apart at once!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing the ugly face of the Xiongren Emperor, the middle-aged officer hastily added: \"However, even if the enemy thickens the city walls, they can't stop the heroic orc soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapsed city wall is a natural ladder, and soldiers can rush along the ruins to the enemy's city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, some orc soldiers charged forward along the ruins of the collapsed city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the road that was blown out is not smooth, and it is difficult to walk normally, let alone charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any delay on the battlefield will cost lives. The charging orc soldiers moved a little slower, and became the target of the archers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of sacrifice was not in vain. A large number of corpses of orc soldiers gradually filled up the ruins, and forcibly piled up a road with the life of beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the Xiongrenhuang, who was overjoyed in his heart, hastily ordered: \"Let the Xiongren heavy infantry step up, and tear the enemy's tortoise shell for me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of bear soldiers immediately attracted the attention of the generals defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for the slightest hesitation, Raquel immediately ordered: \"Pour the fire oil quickly, and light the fire immediately when the enemy comes up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a second-generation dude to a general who defended the city, Raquel also had a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally made up his mind to act with the expeditionary force, holding Hudson's thigh in the melee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan didn't change quickly. I don't know what's wrong with my old man. He actually thought it was too dangerous to follow the expeditionary army to break the siege of Dapace, so he stayed in the Fort of Flying Bear to garrison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel doesn't know how risky the expeditionary army is on this trip, anyway, he has already felt the danger of stationing at the Fort of Flying Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the siege just now, at least thousands of orcs were killed in the army. With such a large number of casualties, there should be a pause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Xiongrenhuang who commanded the entire army outside was obviously a bit superior, and directly ignored the casualties of the soldiers under his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing this kind of enemy who wants to forcibly take down the Fort of Flying Bear regardless of their own casualties is definitely not a good thing for the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Raquel couldn't help but greet his father, it was too embarrassing for his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The correct experience in the past does not mean that it will always apply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is dangerous to go out of the city to face the orc army head-on, but Flying Bear Castle, a fortress that symbolizes the shame of the orc royal court, may not be safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adversity is the best way to make people grow. At any rate, they got along with Hudson, and Raquel also learned a lot of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current command, he is deploying according to the previous drill, to welcome the attack of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is a little more mechanical, Raquel has more reserves in his hands. Wherever there is a problem, troops will be sent to reinforce it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting for several days in a row, Flying Bear Castle was defended impeccably, and the orc army couldn't find a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blazing flames not only blocked the attacking footsteps of the orc army, but also took away dozens of Ursar heavy infantry who rushed up first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was the failure of the previous siege, which exercised Xiong Renhuang's psychological endurance, and another failure did not cause his face to change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have wasted too much time in Flying Bear Castle. If we continue to delay, it may affect the next plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of any accidents on the front line due to this, it will be difficult for the allies to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to send a part of the army first to chase along the road ahead of the expeditionary army, which not only blocks their back road, but also fulfills the agreement with the allies. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An elderly priest stepped forward to remind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most special group in the Orc Empire, priests not only take on the important task of offering sacrifices to the gods, but also play the role of wise men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing some bear emperors above, others dare not persuade them, but the respected old priests are not afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitated for a moment, the Bear Emperor nodded and said: \"Bruno, you have dealt with the expeditionary force and know them best. This task will be entrusted to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the third and seventh legions as the core, plus two tauren legions, two leopard legions, two wild boar legions, and one centaur legion, a group army is formed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care about anything else, this expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom must not let them run away. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the loser of the last war, according to normal circumstances, even if Bruno is not held accountable, he will be left idle. But in the army, in addition to record, loyalty is also very important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno suffered a big loss in the last battle, but he also indirectly saved the royal court of the bears, proving his loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For loyal subordinates, Xiongrenhuang has always been tolerant. Seeing that it happened for a reason, he decided to give Bruno Jun another chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the deployment of troops, you can tell that the newly formed army is definitely not that kind of garbage army. They are all orcs as well, and the internal combat power gap is also very large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this new group army, there are not only two main bear armies, but the rest of the major armies are also powerful races. At worst, they can be sent to the middle and upper reaches of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the combat effectiveness is not as good as the main army, but it also exceeds most of the cannon fodder army. On the battlefield, as long as you don't encounter the elite human army, it is also an existence that can kill the Quartet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a strong capital, Xiong Renhuang had no choice but to. The shame can only be washed away with blood. If the expeditionary army is not killed, the stain on his body will always exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured! This time, I will let the expeditionary army know that the dignity of our bear court cannot be lightly insulted! Let the Earl of Hudson die in remorse!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno confidently assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was unconvinced by the loss last time, but now that he has such strong capital, there is no need to be afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the great reputation of the expeditionary force in the orc empire, they were the ones who advertised it, and it couldn't be true at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, Bruno would have laughed happily. Isn't it the credit for bringing these troops to cut off the retreat of the expeditionary army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing to worry about is the enemy running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a problem, as long as the expeditionary force does not escape in the direction he is responsible for, they can blame the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't destroy the enemy, but you can also defeat the enemy. As long as he breaks the myth of the expeditionary army's invincibility, he is the hero of the bear clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, deep down in his heart, Bruno still longed for a single blow to completely wipe out the expeditionary force led by Hudson and establish his status as a famous general in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the confident subordinates, Xiong Renhuang said with satisfaction: \"It's good to have this kind of confidence!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno, when you take Hudson's head, I will personally hold a celebration banquet for you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Without being able to defeat the defenders immediately, the war gradually turned into a war of attrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the castle was too small to accommodate a large army and could not rely on the advantages of the city to defend, it still played a finale role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rapid assault tactics used by the Beamon cavalry have hit a snag here. No matter how powerful the cavalry is, they are still powerless when they hit the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to penetrate the central army, the army formation relying on the castle as the core has been standing there steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Beamon cavalry attack from any direction, they can attack the defenders in pieces, but there are hundreds of thousands of people in the end, and they cannot be killed in a short while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the people had not been killed, when the Beamon cavalry changed their direction of attack, the noble officers immediately jumped out to reorganize the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one tried to escape, but it was a minority after all. All of them are teams composed of nobles' private troops, and the serfs all watch their master's movements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble officers are not stupid, they know very well what it means to run away now. Staying and resisting may not necessarily lead to death, but running away must be cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being accused of \"deserter\", losing all the glory and family fortune, and being hunted down by the entire human race alliance is obviously uneconomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the initial panic, everyone gradually calmed down after realizing that the number of Beamon cavalry was limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of defenders is large enough to take turns to rest. On the contrary, the number of Beamon cavalry is limited, and they have to rest for a period of time after a shock wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the rest time, not only the Beamon cavalry recovered their strength. The defenders who were passively beaten also recovered their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the long-distance march did not carry heavy weapons, some simple long-range weapons were still equipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the Bimon cavalry charged, they would be baptized by a wave of arrows. Heavy cavalry doesn't matter, but light cavalry will inevitably suffer losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems inconspicuous, but after several times, the combined casualties are still not small, not to mention the normal attrition during the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took two days here to organize thirteen attacks. The number of Beamon cavalry killed in battle had exceeded four digits this morning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the record was even more brilliant, and the number of enemy troops killed was more than ten times that of his own, it still disappointed Prince Butzweig, who was in charge of commanding the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the fight continues like this, it is not known whether the enemy army in front of him can be completely wiped out. Anyway, the Beamon cavalry under his command are about to be tossed and useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a human army. It was smooth sailing during the last Dacias battle, but it hit a snag here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of overall strength, the army in front of us is no stronger than the enemy in the last battle. Although there is an elite infantry regiment and a knight order among them, they cannot hold back the rest of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a temporary mobilized team. Both the quality of the soldiers and the training situation have declined significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost a charge can tear apart the enemy's formation. If it weren't for the castle in the middle blocking the way and preventing the Beamon cavalry from interspersing, he would have won the victory long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is no such thing as a war. The castle in the middle not only guarantees the safety of the coach, but also protects the logistics materials tightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it takes ten days and a half a month here, the enemy can still persist, but as the attacking side, they will not be able to bear it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the soldiers on the battlefield are very fast. Prince Butzweig needs to think about the overall situation, and he can't spend it here forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tried to divide the troops to attack from all sides. As a result, a cavalry regiment unfortunately collided with the enemy's elite army, and was also attacked by the enemy knights, directly losing half of its troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like a basin of ice water in winter, it chilled Prince Butzweig's heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel reality told him that it was not a good choice for cavalry to storm the infantry formation, even if the infantry's combat effectiveness was average.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, an urgent report came from the Eagle Scouts, and the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force suddenly accelerated their march and headed straight for the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to their marching speed, they will arrive in Da Pest City at the earliest tomorrow night and the morning of the day after tomorrow at the slowest. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Satuke reported nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of a person, the shadow of a tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's name has a certain deterrent effect on the middle and lower ranks of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual combat effectiveness of the hundreds of thousands of expeditionary troops has not yet been confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the answer given by the Eagle scouts is: the elite of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if one Yingman says so, if a group of Yingmen say so, then we must pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the expeditionary force has the record of annihilating the Beamon cavalry regiment, severely injuring the bear infantry regiment, and riding on the bear royal court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least it can be determined that the expeditionary force has more than 20,000 elite infantry and thousands of elite cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of enemy, even Prince Butzweig, who has made great achievements in battle, should take a high look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the battlefield, Prince Butzweig gave an order rather unwillingly: \"Send the order, call for gold and withdraw the troops. The army rests for a day, and will return to Dapace early tomorrow morning!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best time for a decisive battle has been missed, and Prince Butzweig is confident that he can defeat the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that he has no time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the time for returning to the aid is late, the expeditionary force and the defenders of Dapace should cooperate internally and externally, and the 300,000 orc army besieging the city may not be able to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court's reinforcements had just set off. If the 300,000 orc army collapsed first, his Bimon cavalry army would be alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A Beamon army that is not full of strength and becomes a lone army is giving the enemy a head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless nobles will regard them as a rank of promotion, and swarms of enemies will tear them to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars can be lost, but the myth that the Beamon cavalry is \"invincible\" cannot be shattered. The political interests involved behind this are too great, and Prince Butzweig does not want to become a sinner of the Beamon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At dusk, an army marching in neat steps appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before anyone arrived, the sound of uniform footsteps had already spread in all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson didn't want to rush over in such a hurry, but the sudden situation made him let go of his fantasy of preserving his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, he is no longer the commander of the small army. In addition to considering the interests of the expeditionary force, he must also consider the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only from the limited information, he has already seen that the situation in the Warhammer Kingdom is not good, and the Principality of Moxi is also on the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these two allies fall, the next target of the orc army will definitely be the Alpha Kingdom. Hudson still understands the truth of cold lips and teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom is out of reach, but Moshi Principality still has to find a way to keep it. With one more ally around to share the pressure, the domestic pressure will be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were no two allies, there would be an army of millions of orcs on the western front of the kingdom. An expeditionary force alone can't stand up to so many enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Closer, closer...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when, the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi also appeared on the city wall, and they are looking into the distance full of expectations at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc army suddenly launched an attack on the city, they might be able to catch a big fish or two. It's a pity that the sight of the orcs is now focused on the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army that originally besieged Dapes also separated a team to block the direction of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky has gradually dimmed, and it won't be long before night falls. This time is no longer suitable for fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the crossbowmen will shoot a volley, and then the heavy infantry will attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered uncharacteristically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the disadvantages of night battles, he didn't want to have a Beamon cavalry suddenly appearing on his back during the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic goal this time is to relieve the siege of Dapes, not to wipe out the orc army. It is enough to defeat the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to blame it, the monster has a big heart. Knowing that the expeditionary force is approaching, it still doesn't let go of the siege of Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dividing troops to intercept seems to be both, but in fact it is difficult to take care of either side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, 300,000 troops besieged Dapace with some reluctance, but now half of the troops have been mobilized to confront the expeditionary army. It is obviously a joke for the remaining 150,000 troops to besiege more than 100,000 defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that he couldn't do it, Balazs had no choice but to do it. Although the orc empire is ruled by the five royal families, the military orders are still like a mountain when it comes to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order he received was to besiege the city of Dapace, so it must be carried out. Otherwise, even if you win the battle, you will be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want autonomy, dream it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him not a member of the five royal families?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to act as the commander-in-chief was because Prince Butzweig saw his outstanding ability, but that was all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cannon fodder is cannon fodder after all, the more capable you are, the faster you die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Appointing him as the acting commander seems to be Prince Butzweig's respect for him. Who can guarantee that this is not looking for the blamed man?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bait is bait after all, no matter how adequate the plan is, there will always be omissions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once an accident happens, someone must be responsible for it. Prince Butzweig was unwilling to take the blame, and neither did the dignitaries of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A general who can command hundreds of thousands of troops is a high-end talent anywhere. Prince Butzweig couldn't take risks with his own people, so Balazs, who was born in the ape-human race, was pushed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of arrows raining \"嗖嗖嗖...\" opened the prelude to the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Counterattack!\" \"Send the order, the magic crystal cannon turns and runs to target the enemy's central army! All crossbow arrows...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Balazs could finish speaking, the magic crystal cannon on the city wall sounded first. Apparently the defenders on the city wall were aware of the outbreak of the war, and they also launched an attack on the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Plop, plop... ah...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy infantry walking at the forefront of the team suddenly fell into a hidden pit and let out a scream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson frowned slightly. It was obvious that the enemy had been prepared for a long time, and the commander on the opposite side was not the kind of tough guy he had encountered in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earth magician, cast magic to fill up the enemy's trap!\" While giving the order, Hudson silently joined the team of spellcasters. Of course, the main force of the shot is Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance to the left and right from the enemy's position is only one hundred and eighty meters. Even if there are traps, there are not many. It is not difficult to destroy these obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are such traps along the way, there is no way. Even if the magician is exhausted, they can't finish it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brief delay did not affect the continuation of the war. The hand-to-hand battle quickly kicked off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-level officers of the Principality of Moxi standing on the city wall watching the battle stared nervously at the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The sky is already dark, and it will be dark soon. How can we launch an attack at this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That is, the outside world is saying that the Earl of Hudson is a **** of soldiers. How did he come up with such a stupid move?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are right, the Earl of Hudson is indeed out of standard this time. Even if he wants to rob the camp, he will have to wait until midnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do it now, hey... After all, you are still too young! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A noise came out, followed by a series of voices of criticism, which disturbed the spectators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the battle has already started, no matter what they think, they can only follow up now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, don't worry, Earl Hudson launched a battle at this time, which is actually understandable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all know how fast the Bimon cavalry are. It is estimated that they have also received the news now, and they will be able to come back at noon tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we can end the battle in one morning, we will not only have to face the 300,000 troops outside the city, but also a highly mobile Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting a battle now, although it is very difficult, is also the time with the highest chance of winning. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the style of painting was a little nervous, Earl Martins hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the guess is accurate or not, the defenders must now cooperate with the expeditionary force. If there is any trouble, the final loss will be paid by the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Martins, there is no general in command in the city. Among us, you are the most skilled in military affairs. The next battle will be entrusted to you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to drive ducks to the shelves. When Dapace was besieged, all important generals in the army were outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The short man, the general, and Earl Martins, who has served as the Minister of Military Affairs for many years, is the most knowledgeable person among the people present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, Earl Martins has a good resume. He once commanded an army to quell civil strife many times, and even organized an army to smash the orc tribe's plan to plunder southward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other people's record, Earl Martins can already be regarded as experienced in leading troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, let me take command of the next battle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an emergency, Earl Martins showed his responsibility as the Minister of Military Affairs, and took over the important task without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing at the battlefield, he glanced at the crowd again, and said slowly: \"It is difficult to distinguish the enemy from the enemy in the dark, and this is the biggest difficulty in night battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please trouble the prime minister to organize and collect all the magic lamps and glowing gems in the city. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Prime Minister Herceg nodded directly, and then said to everyone:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When the country is in crisis, everyone should take the lead, and let's borrow the lighting equipment at home for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hams, you go back and bring all the lighting equipment from the prime minister's mansion, especially the magic lamp in the warehouse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fert, go and call all the light magicians in the city. Even magic apprentices, as long as they can release the lighting technique, they will be recruited by me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are splitting up, each responsible for an area of ​​the city, collecting lighting fixtures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato, you are in charge...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reasonable request, everyone is very cooperative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As shareholders of the Principality of Moxi, no one wants this big ship to sink more than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though they knew that it would be difficult to return the loan intact after the war, they still chose to lose their money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's a pity that the idea is full, but the reality is skinny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multiple races are fighting together, and it is not easy to be able to form an army formation. It would be too embarrassing for the beast to freely change the formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order to \"change the formation\" not only failed to reverse the situation, but instead caused confusion in the formations on both wings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in places where different races join together, many jokes have been made. At this moment, many orc soldiers couldn't tell the difference between east, west and north, and they became headless flies scurrying around on the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Balazs almost vomited blood with anger. It was really shocking. Even though he knew that the orc army was useless, he never thought it would be so bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and equipment are not as good as human races, which is determined by productivity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The limited armor is on the soldiers of the five royal families. Even if there are surplus armor piled up in the warehouse to eat dirt, it is impossible to equip them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a matter of principle. Once the vassal race grows bigger, it will be a matter of minutes to turn the customer into the main.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the orc royal family, they can lose to humans, and they can't let the vassal races grow bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What loses to humans is the hegemony of the continent, and they can still live in a corner; the vassal races become bigger, but they are shaking the foundation of their existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Years of exploitation and oppression, the accumulated conflicts between the orc royal family and various races in the country are not necessarily lower than the hatred between orcs and humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of humans, all orcs are one. But in the eyes of the orcs, only their own race is considered their own, and the orcs of other races are competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Army attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balaz ordered slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actively looking for a decisive battle with the expeditionary force was not in his plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the plan can't keep up with the rapid changes. If the elite of the expeditionary force are allowed to play, their army formation will be destroyed sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of being beaten passively, it is better to attack from the master and follower, and drag all the soldiers of the expeditionary army into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rich life experience told him that the Alpha Kingdom was not generous enough to send hundreds of thousands of elite reinforcements to the Moxi Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they are not elites, the difference in combat power between everyone will not be too great. Only large-scale melee can maximize their military advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's almost dark, and when the night falls, let's start a big fight together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The cavalry corps is attacking, targeting the enemy's flanks!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By choosing to start the war at this time, he was mentally prepared to fight in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the average army, fighting in the dark of night is a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the expeditionary army is different. It seems to be an elite army, but in fact the proportion of elite soldiers is less than 30%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directly set up a formation to face the orc army head-on, and the pseudo-elite mixed in it can easily be intimidated by the cruel battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, they have the cover of night, and their sight only stays within a limited range, which is more conducive to their performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you can't see the situation of your comrades in the distance, the morale of the army will not collapse. After killing a few orcs, maybe the morale of the army will be even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of gameplay is only suitable for troops with high morale. If an army is distracted, it will only collapse faster in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, fighting in the dark night, in addition to the strength of the two sides, the more important thing is the collision of hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is betting that the morale of the expeditionary army is higher than that of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two armies chose to attack at the same time, and the shouts of killing resounded throughout the world. The first thing that broke out was an actual combat exercise of riding and shooting tactics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless arrows rushed into the orc army like a tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After three rounds of cavalry shooting, not only did the cavalry not choose to charge, but they retreated tens of meters before returning to the previous action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no best tactic, only the most suitable tactic. An army of orcs without any armor is the best living target on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific results of the battle, the chaotic scene is really impossible to count, the only thing that is certain is: the orc army under the rain of arrows, the morale of the army is constantly being worn down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The candy-like gameplay made Balazs mentally collapse. It was so shameless that instead of charging, the cavalry played with bows and arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time I have encountered such a shameless enemy, how can I think of a countermeasure in a while?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the army has already launched a charge, and it can't be stopped at all if it wants to. Any untimely order may lead to a major defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knew it would cost him a lot to continue like this, Balazs could only grit his teeth and stand firm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the orc soldiers on the two wings who collapsed even more. They marched against the enemy's arrow rain, and their hearts were not strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they were pushed forward by the rear army, and they couldn't stop at all. They could only grit their teeth and hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a moment, the screams resounded in all directions, even on the city wall, they could be heard clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the light, it is impossible to overlook the entire battlefield from the tower at this moment. Earl Martins commanded the army purely by feeling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the successive magical lighting equipment, Earl Martins knew that it was time to attack, and if it was later, the expeditionary army outside would be scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to cheat teammates. In the next battle, the Principality of Moxi still needs the expeditionary force to continue to contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order down, and the lights shine on the camp of the orc army ahead. The first, second and third armies of the garrison attack, and attack the orc army back and forth with the expeditionary army!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The light magician moved with the army, waiting for the opportunity to cast lighting spells on the camp of the orc army, and brought all the lighting scrolls, half of the powerful attack scrolls...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With an order, countless lights flashed instantly. I don't know who invented it, but also specially put a reflective shell on the magic lamp, so that the light can shine forward as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of alchemists created by magicians immediately set up an incomprehensible magic circle on the stage, and the light from countless lamps directly gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city wall that was originally illuminated by magic lamps dimmed again, and all the lights were moved above the orc army. It was like the sun falling from the sky, illuminating the camp like daytime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden scene made the orc soldiers very uncomfortable. The dazzling light illuminated the way forward for them, but it also exposed their figures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The target was found again, and the crossbow arrows and magic crystal cannon on the city tower rang out again. The defenders who rushed out of the city were sent a wave of magic rain first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless scrolls flew all over the sky, tearing apart the formation of the orc army in an instant. Before the first-line orc officer ordered to block the gap, the army rushed in along the torn hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing the offensive of Moxi's army, Balazs was so angry that he swears directly. It's really bullying. The expeditionary army only relies on the strength of armor and weapons, but the Moxi people directly use magic methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of attack regardless of cost, no matter how powerful the orc army is, it can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A round of magic rain came down and cleared an open space directly. Any resistance in the face of extraordinary power seemed pale and powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chaos has already begun, but the scene of the battle was a bit beyond Baratz's expectations. In the face of magic alchemy technology, his past experience has gone to an extreme that he has never heard of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the cover brought by the night belongs only to the enemy, and they still enjoy the \"day\" brought by the light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order to let the masters accompanying the army destroy the magic lamps on the enemy towers. They must not keep them on!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a panic, Balazs hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless figures flew out of the army and headed straight for the city wall. It's a pity that this order was obviously too late. The figures of these people had just sprang out, and they had exposed themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless crossbow arrows shot directly at them. The master who managed to break through the rain of arrows from the army was intercepted by Moxi's master before he touched the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was destined to be a low-cost battle. The magic means on the city wall could not be destroyed, but the orc masters who rushed out suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who commanded the battle from afar, witnessed the massacre brought about by the unequal technology, and was greatly shocked in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic can still be used in this way, and he has learned it this time. Sure enough, human potential is forced out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden outbreak of the Mosi made Hudson re-acquainted with this unreliable ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson was going to hit the morale of the orcs first, and then use the chaos in the night to slowly lead the orc army to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it seems that there is no need to be so troublesome. Facing the front and back attacks of the expeditionary army and the defenders, it was only a matter of time before the orc army collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the orc army that was put together was not very high, and it was worn down by Hudson for a while, and now I have witnessed the collapse of my companions. The blow to the morale of the army is absolutely fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who took the lead, the orc army gathered together, suddenly someone broke away from the army from the two wings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a melee involving hundreds of thousands of people, the appearance of a few deserters is nothing, but the impact of these three or five deserters is huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Supervisor team, go hunt deserters!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Barazz's order had just been issued when he realized that the situation was not good. At this time, the supervisor team left and fell into the eyes of ordinary soldiers, who could easily be regarded as runaway soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be chasing and killing deserters, but in fact it is unfortunate that it acts as the \"leader\", causing more followers to follow and run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing, it doesn't make any sense. Cannibalism has long been commonplace in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they are not from the same tribe, they are all competitors; if they are of different races, they are even more \"mortal enemies\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the resource-poor orc empire, if the orcs want to live better, they can only rely on fighting and winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is an enemy, it is natural to attack if there is a chance. If it weren't for the constraints of military law, civil wars would have broken out among the tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order down, let the soldiers besieging the city rush over and join the battle!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balaz ordered again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the moment of crisis, he no longer cared about the constraints of military orders. Violating the military order will certainly cause blood mold, but you can also look forward to the \"conscience\" of the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this thing is a rare item in the upper echelon of the Orc Empire, there may still be exceptions occasionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose the battle, not only you will die. The whole family, even the tribe they belong to, will be unlucky together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything is in vain. When the collapse comes, no matter how many troops there are, the end will be the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, fighting a war is about strength and morale. There is no absolute strength to crush opponents, and the morale of the army is the key to determining the outcome of a game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the expeditionary army was high, and the Moxi people who were besieged in the isolated city were fighting with their backs. These are not comparable to the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the orc army fleeing in all directions, Hudson not only did not order to intercept, but restrained the cavalry's offensive, deliberately letting them leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the more than 300,000 orc army, less than one-tenth of them were wiped out in the battle just now. If you want to rely on the expeditionary force to hunt down, even if you kill until dawn, you won't be able to kill many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to guide the enemy to kill each other. It is not extravagant to expect how many orcs will die in the internal fighting, as long as the hatred among the tribes is stirred up, this army will be abolished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for letting the orc army collapse and disperse, Hudson believes that the local disasters brought about by this will be solved by the moxi nobles everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they can't even solve the scattered broken soldiers, it proves that they are weak and deserve to be eliminated by this era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside Fort Allente, in the camp of the Beamon army, Prince Butzweig, who had just received the news of the outbreak of the war, was taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy actually did not follow common sense and chose to attack overnight, making it clear that he would not give him a chance to come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to rush back to join the war starry night or not is a tangled question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Beamon Cavalry Legion is elite, it has exhausted a lot of physical strength in the daytime battles. If it goes all the way for more than two hundred miles, I am afraid that when it reaches the place, 10% of its strength will be left at most half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading tired soldiers to the battlefield is a taboo in military affairs. If you are not careful, you will suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But without sending troops to reinforce, Prince Butzweig has no idea. The army of orcs who besieged the city of Dapace were all bait selected by the five imperial courts, or abandoned children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troops that can be easily abandoned have a somewhat self-evident combat effectiveness. If they really have strength, even if they want to eliminate dissidents, they will make their death more valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Prince Butzweig found himself in a \"dilemma\", unable to advance or retreat for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order to let the Eagle scouts dispatch immediately, contact the reinforcements of the major imperial courts, and urge them to rush to the battlefield as soon as possible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's already late tonight, it's better to start tomorrow morning. After all, there were 300,000 troops, and Prince Butzweig didn't believe that he couldn't hold on for a night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Whether it is the orc army or the human army, they have all fallen into the embarrassing situation of \"the soldiers don't know the generals, and the generals don't know the soldiers\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of human soldiers is better. Ordinary soldiers don't have so many life and death enemies. Even if there are individual enemies, the probability of encountering them on the battlefield is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army is different. Although they are fighting together, the racial hatred accumulated over countless years cannot be eliminated with a single military order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After falling into chaos, the original military orders and laws also lost their binding force on everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who made a bad start, killing the hostile aliens who strayed into their own race's army, and then spread to the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pandora's box is opened, and the situation is no longer under control. At this moment, all the ugliness of the beast was exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, it is to kill the hostile race that entered by mistake, and then it becomes actively looking for opportunities for revenge. This kind of thing happened so much that it was impossible to keep it secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a beast's brain, so it's not so clever to think about problems. When he found out that his own person had been killed, he brought up the knife to take revenge without even thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop it, you idiots! Supervise the battle team, separate them...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balaz roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, there can still be cannibalism, and he is powerless. There are really \"pig teammates\" in this wave, and they really can't be moved!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that low-level orcs with insufficient IQ don't think so much once they become red-eyed. The intervention of the supervisory team just added a group of people to join the melee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Command the army to fight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, it has become a joke. Even if it is an expeditionary force, what Hudson can mobilize now is only the reserve team that has not participated in the battle and the cavalry wandering on the edge of the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team that was deeply involved in the war was already in a mess at this moment. The training in the past can only allow the soldiers below to maintain the linkage of a small group of ten people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An officer who can gather hundreds of soldiers is a talent. As for more troops, it is no longer a question of wanting to, but it is simply impossible in reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when communications depended on roaring, after the army fell into chaos, the limit of the soldiers that a front-line officer could directly command was the range of his voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beyond this limit, soldiers can't even hear the orders of officers, let alone implement them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that in this chaotic scene, no matter how many troops are thrown into it, they will soon be dragged into chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the more you do, the more mistakes you make. For soldiers trapped in the battlefield, any order issued will cause a new round of chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is meaningless to increase troops, so just watch them kill randomly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this **** battle, all the survivors are veterans. They couldn't stand the test of war and fell on the battlefield. They could only be considered unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In troubled times, the least valuable thing is \"life\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop shelling at the south gate, and start shelling from the other three gates instead. No need to aim, just shoot randomly at me. The farther the shells hit, the better!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins suddenly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle in the south of the city has been going on until now, and the two armies have been fighting together. If the magic crystal cannon continues, it will fight with their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the other three sides. At the moment, it is so dark that nothing can be seen. Adding some artillery fire can create psychological pressure on the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The magic crystal cannon hit me back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Balatz's disease, who rushed to the doctor in a hurry, ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the second time he has made a mistake. He just ordered the besieging army to come over for reinforcements, and now he wants them to organize firepower to fight back. It is a big failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Balazs has no choice. Seeing the army collapse, he has to do something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the fact that the two sides are still fighting, it's just that the orc army in the center has no place to run. There are more and more deserters sneaking away in the fringe areas, and some even run away in tribes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the centripetal force of the orc empire was not strong, and the army obeyed the orders of the five royal families purely out of respect for the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beasts are oppressed on weekdays, and asking them to sacrifice their lives for the Beast Empire is obviously deliberately embarrassing the \"beast\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic lamp on the tower cannot cover the entire battlefield after all. There are too many unknowns hidden in dark corners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc soldiers kept fleeing, and reinforcements from the other three sides of the city wall continued to make up for it. The collapsed battle situation was dragged in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, Balazs was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene was too chaotic, the orc army had already overwhelmed the entire army, the expeditionary army still had a reserve team, and not all the defenders in the city had been killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the sun rises, it will be their end, and maybe they don't even need to wait for the light of day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time passed by, and the battlefield was completely in chaos. At this point, even if Balazs wanted to give the order, he didn't know who to give the order to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commanders of the major legions under his command have all lost contact. As the commander, only the soldiers of his tribe are left available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big crash finally came, but this time the crash came a bit bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More and more deserters directly led the follow-up reinforcements in the wrong direction, running wildly all the way in the dark night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late when the tribal leader realized that he was going off track. In the dark night, the troops could not be found at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it was accidental or deliberate, it doesn't matter now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no reinforcements, the orc soldiers exposed to the light quickly realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The comrades-in-arms have all run away, and whoever stays in the **** battle is a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One by one scrambled to run, anyway, there was cover in the dark, and they were not afraid of the enemy's pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ming Jin withdraws troops, treats the wounded!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suddenly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the vast night, with only a little bit of light from the moon, he really didn't dare to let the army under his command continue to pursue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that if the soldiers were to attack at this time, more people would be lost tomorrow morning than those killed tonight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle has progressed so far, and the scattered orc soldiers have fled to nowhere. It is not easy to reorganize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, all the siege weapons they carried were thrown under the city. Even if they completed the reorganization again, they lost the ability to threaten Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the soldiers collect the magic crystal cannon and bed crossbow, Hudson was speechless. Sure enough, it was very orc-like, and it was bigger than the ones he had seen before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to transport so many big guys here is enough to prove how hard the orcs are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these five big and three rough guys are destined to have no chance with the expeditionary army, and can only be thrown to the Moxi people as defense tools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystals and magic cores used to emit energy were most likely taken away by the orcs, and none of them were left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Searched all the orc camps, but found no valuable spoils, which made Hudson feel very disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The broken copper and iron all over the ground really didn't interest him, so he simply left the aftermath work to the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the palace has prepared a celebration banquet, please...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the visitor could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"I'm already tired today, reinforcements from the orcs may appear at any time, and the expeditionary force still has follow-up work to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will not be attending the celebration banquet, please thank Your Majesty the King for my kindness! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of Chris IX's illness was kept strictly confidential, and all edicts were issued normally in the name of the king, even Hudson didn't know about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the words of refusal, Renato was both embarrassed and relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refusal to attend the banquet is a trivial matter, the key is that the expeditionary force did not ask to enter the city. The military discipline of the army is not very good these days, especially this kind of guest army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if other places are harmed, but Dapace is the capital of the king. If you are tossed about, you will have to suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the expeditionary army was rumored to have strict military discipline, the senior leaders of the Principality of Moxi did not dare to bet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I didn't know how to refuse the expeditionary army to enter the city. I didn't expect that Hudson had no idea of ​​letting everyone enter the city at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having resolved his worries, Renato became more and more eager.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson is not a diplomat, and he is not interested in in-depth communication with the foreign minister of the Principality of Mosi, so he dismissed it in a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the opportunity to deepen the friendship between the two countries?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That was something the king and the ministers in the capital needed to consider. As the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, he only needed to fight a good battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a good character to seek his own government in his position and stretch his hands around. Who makes Hudson, the coach, still a newcomer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current status is all typed out. The foundation in the kingdom is extremely unstable, and he has no qualifications to be a minister at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were a certain veteran nobleman, he would have been fully responsible for the affairs of the Principality of Moxi at this moment, and would try to distribute as much cake as possible, and would not give others a chance at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson is also operating. It's just that they are all forming good karma in their personal capacity, and it won't be effective in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war is over, it is time to reap the fruits. He is not qualified to touch the political interests that are on the surface, but it does not mean that the hidden commercial interests cannot intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a general in command, a bit of aloofness is also a must. How indifferent he is in business, but how enthusiastic he is in private. When dealing with smart people, everything goes without saying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lifting the siege of Dapace is only half completed. The next step is to withstand the orc's counterattack before the real success is complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Renato was sent away, Hudson had secretly planned how to deal with the Beamon cavalry. This is also a battle against time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five imperial courts of the orcs have all sent reinforcements, and they will arrive at the city of Dapace in the fastest five days. The slowest one is still building the road. I don't know when it will arrive, so I don't need to think about it for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to severely damage or encircle the Beamon cavalry, the time left for them is only five days, or even less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of tonight's battle will soon reach the orc royal court, and it is very likely that they will change their decision and let the cavalry get ahead of the brigade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original five-day journey can be completed in two days at most. If you dare to run all the way, you will not be surprised to reach the front line Hudson one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the probability of this happening is very low. If you really play long-distance raids, your combat effectiveness will be greatly reduced, and you will suffer a big loss if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is undoubtedly the best choice to take advantage of the different arrival times of the orc reinforcements from various directions and create a gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to plan like this, Hudson also has the confidence. The orcs have reinforcements, and the Principality of Moxi also has reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reinforcements from the southern provinces were beaten up by the Beamon cavalry, they have not received any bad news about the destruction of the entire army so far, which means that the situation will not be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the other two reinforcements are still doing well. And the arrival time was a little faster than the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the ordinary army is ignored, the elite regiments of the Principality of Moxi can always come in handy. Especially those knight groups are the absolute main force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the superiority of troops, it would be perfect if the orcs' encirclement plan turned into a \"refueling tactic\" with a time difference between fighting the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be realized or not, there is always a plan. Although the success rate is low, what if the enemy is stupid?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you open the history books, you will find that 99% of the legendary battles are filled with a lot of idiots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the kind of peak duel that rarely becomes a legend. Unless there is an absolute gap in strength, there is a high probability that if the two powerhouses meet, they will end up with both losers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the first ray of sunlight in the morning, he turned around and glanced at the Beamon cavalry who were waiting in formation. Prince Butzweig waved his hand and said, \"The whole army set off and return to Dapes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the mighty Beamon cavalry leave, Earl Fidelis, who wanted to order the whole army to attack several times and stab the Beamon cavalry in the eye, finally resisted the temptation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really can't afford to offend him. As far as the number of cavalry in his hand is concerned, if he offends the Beamon cavalry, few of them will be able to come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the infantry, even the shadow of the Beamon cavalry, let alone causing trouble to others in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly an eagle descended from the sky and landed in front of the Beamon cavalry. It can be seen from the blood color hidden in the eagle's eyes that he must not have slept well last night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Yingren has good eyesight, it is inevitable that he will go astray in the dark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to send the information as soon as possible, all the Eaglemen in the orc army traveled day and night to find traces of Prince Butzweig's camp when they were defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, it was the messenger who had traveled twice before, and found the Beamon army first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Quickly... tell Prince Butzweig that the army...during the night...something happened!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, he passed out directly, and passed the bad news to Prince Butzweig successfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sacrifice, save people!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig, who received the news, hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He may not care about the life and death of an Yingman, but he cannot ignore the life and death of the 300,000 besieging army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these troops were defined as cannon fodder from the very beginning, they couldn't be buried in such a vague way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ancient sacrificial song sounded, and Yingren, who was in a coma, slowly opened his eyes. He just opened his mouth to say something, but suddenly got stuck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expression of the priest in charge of the treatment changed. He just wanted to wake up the person as soon as possible, but he didn't expect the side effects of the spell he cast to be too great, so he sent the person away directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He kept crying in his heart, but he said without changing his face: \"Your Highness, this eagle has been injured many times, and its body has long been exhausted. Now it has returned to the embrace of the beast god!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't ask any useful information, and wasted the time on the road, Prince Butzweig's face was very ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he was helpless in the face of the fearless priest. A layman like him has no say in such professional matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"keep going!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he had turned over and jumped onto the beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be said that they have stepped on more pits in the past few days than they have stepped on in the first half of their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most exasperating thing is that according to the intelligence from Yingman's investigation, there is still a team ahead that continues to sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the expeditionary force went to the front to fight, several engineering regiments were left behind to sabotage. The more difficult the road section, the more severely damaged it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some road sections near the water source, not only the road is full of potholes, but also turned into a muddy road by introducing water flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Ying people who were in charge of the investigation, it is estimated that the damming of the river and the flooding of the Seventh Army could have been arranged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flooding of the Seventh Army did not happen, but the flood flooded the road, and they still did not escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bad road greatly reduced the speed of the orc army. Originally, the expeditionary force had traveled for five and a half days, but it took them four days to travel less than one-third of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest reason for the slow speed is to build roads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It won't work if you don't repair it. As the nearest support army, they also shoulder the heavy responsibility of escorting logistics supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed so far, and the Principality of Moxi has either been passive or active, and has completed the fortification and clearing of the warring area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the noble castles along the way were all empty. Either they ran to participate in the defense of Dapes City, or they joined the various armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord is responsible for guarding the territory, which does not mean that he cannot be flexible. The king issued a call-up order, and the original responsibilities were no longer a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flexibility of the Mosi people directly made the orc army miserable. When the nobles evacuated, they destroyed the supplies that could not be taken away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either poisoning the grain and grass, or just killing it with a fire. Even those who slipped through the net were snatched up by the army ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to obtain more supplies, the orc army could only go farther to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more than 300,000 orcs besieging Dapes. The food and grass consumption of such a large army can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area around    has long been ravaged. With Dapac as the center, you don't want to see people in a radius of hundreds of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the range is expanded to three hundred miles, there are only a few military fortresses left. Ordinary serfs and free people have either been reduced to the souls of the sword, or have fled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the occupied area, if you can't get enough supplies, you can only raise food from the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, not all orcs can make a living by eating leaves and grass. Without sufficient nutritional supplements, it is simply impossible to support high-intensity combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that the Bearman Royal Court was the closest to Dapace, and asked them to send a batch of food and grass to the emergency, but the team that should have arrived at the earliest, now fell to the last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several times Bruno wanted to order the army to detour, but he gave up in the end considering practical issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can detour, but war beasts and convoys cannot. What's more, the increased time for detours may not be much less than road construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made them all outsiders?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is gone, there is not even a guide. It's okay to walk along the avenue, but it's embarrassing if you get lost while crossing the trail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the strange Yingman falling from the sky, Bruno's mood became worse. His intuition told him that this was here again to urge him to speed up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He also wanted to hurry there and seek revenge from the expeditionary force, but the problem was that the road had to be built first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army moved forward all the way, and when it was about 30 miles away from Da Pest, the Beamon cavalry finally encountered the orc soldiers who were fleeing in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon officer walking at the forefront is a smart ghost who knows what his prince wants now. Seeing the broken soldiers, they were arrested without saying a word, and sent to Prince Butzweig.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell me, what happened to Dapac?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Prince Butzweig's sharp eyes, a few unlucky **** collapsed and stood still in a daze for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, didn't you hear what I was asking?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig grabbed a hapless guy, and angrily reprimanded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the aloof Prince Beamon, being able to talk to these humble races is already a great gift. These guys dare to be in a daze, it is simply unforgivable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear...Prince...Your Highness, I...we don't know anything...!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was dark, and then the army was routed, and we really don't know what happened. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting a confused answer, Prince Butzweig directly threw out the confused egg in his hand, and directly came out with a flying beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing a \"plop\", he fell seven or eight meters away. His body struggled instinctively, and then fell completely silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no cure, and now no one dares to anger the angry Prince Butzweig. It's just a lowly wild boar, and he can't get on the stage at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What about you? Just like this stupid pig, you don't know anything?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the murderous eyes of Prince Butzweig, several wild boars sensed danger, and the one who was targeted could only reply tremblingly: \"No...His Royal Highness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I remember that at dusk yesterday, the expeditionary force appeared on the battlefield, and immediately launched an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander ordered half of the army to intercept the expeditionary army, and then the defenders in the city also came out, flanking us back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after that, it got dark, and the enemy set up a headlight on the tower to illuminate the battlefield as it was daytime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there are magic crystal cannons, fighting, cavalry...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wild boar recalled all his memories, perhaps because he was too nervous, the content was a bit upside down, and the front and back could not be connected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with his superhuman wisdom, Prince Butzweig still roughly figured out the current situation—the expeditionary army and the defenders in the city joined forces to defeat the besieging army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there is no after. The 300,000 orc army died and fled, and the situation has long been lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed on, the whole army stops advancing, and they set up camp on the spot to rest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rescue target is gone, and it is meaningless to continue to rush over long distances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how \"useless\" the army besieging the city is, it is still 300,000 troops after all. Without this army, Prince Butzweig would not dare to go to a decisive battle with the human race with only a Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No troops were sent to search for the defeated soldiers. It was not that Prince Butzweig was not interested in increasing the number of troops, and it was impossible to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army has a variety of races, and it is very difficult to coordinate internally. They are usually compiled in units of tribes and races. If you want to restore the system, you must first find their tribal leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"upright orc\" recognizes death, and only recognizes the leader of his own tribe, or it may be that outsiders he just met can't remember.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the low-level orcs have no cultural heritage. It is nothing new for a single race to be illiterate in the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For their own rule, the five imperial families not only blocked the downward transmission of knowledge, but also deliberately suppressed the cultural development of the vassal races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many races have developed for countless years and are still in the most primitive production stage. At least in military-related fields, it has not taken a step forward for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The civilization of the younger brothers has stayed where it is, and it is not surprising that the productivity of the five royal families of the orcs lags behind that of the human race only because of the population toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to pay for this. Under the most primitive mobilization system, you can't do anything without the tribal leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers of the same race may be able to barely command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now this kind of broken army is everywhere, and the establishment cannot be restored even if it is gathered and reorganized. If you want to form an army again, you can only mix multiple races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting conflicting ethnic groups into one army is equivalent to putting \"sheep and wolves\" in a pen. What will happen next, you don't need to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the first time that the Royal Palace of Prince Moxi came to attend a high-level meeting, and it was only when Hudson learned of the news that Chris IX fell ill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it was done on purpose, or if he was really happy, but Chris IX still attended the military meeting in spite of illness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his keen perception, Hudson saw at a glance that this was not a disease, but a manifestation of his body being hollowed out and his life was about to end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to sustain it until now, apart from extraordinary willpower, it is estimated that he also hanged himself with treasures that nourished vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an ally, Hudson sincerely hopes that Chris IX can live for a few more years, at least until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi cannot withstand any turmoil now. Even if the change of kingship goes smoothly, it will inevitably lead to internal turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This cannot be avoided by personal will.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX obviously saw this, so he gritted his teeth and supported it. Coming out to participate in the military meeting at this moment, there is no lack of showing favor to Hudson, or expressing a position to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the marriage between the two countries is already in progress. Hudson is very aware of how obsessed his crown prince is with Princess Anne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, this marriage is the best choice for both parties. The common enemy has brought the two countries together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Principality of Moxi is critical, and it needs the support of a large force; the Kingdom of Alpha also needs to stabilize the western front, and supporting the Principality of Moxi is supporting itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, Crown Prince Caesar's performance in the Principality of Moxi was a big loss, and the reputation on the mainland has taken a sharp turn for the worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reputation is bad, it will definitely be greatly affected when they marry. Not everyone is willing to choose a future king's son-in-law with little real power to marry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Struggling is meaningless. The general view of the outside world is: After experiencing the strong king of Caesar III, the following Caesar IV must be a weak king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless Crown Prince Caesar turns the tables against the wind and proves his ability again, he will be able to wash away the shame brought about by his previous failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is impossible. No one will rest assured that he will come out to command the army again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to make great achievements in the military, and it is even more difficult to earn performance in politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The princes and ministers below are all old foxes, how can a crown prince be able to handle it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing in accordance with the rules of the game, everyone will give some face, if he crosses the line, he will suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, you will preside over this meeting!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said with a slightly trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that expression, it seemed as if he might go to see the Lord of Dawn at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg replied cautiously, lest his voice be too loud and accidentally take the king away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We have already calculated the results of the battle last night. We defeated more than 300,000 orcs and killed more than 60,000 orcs...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chief minister is naturally our Earl of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the battle last night, the expeditionary force commanded by Earl Hudson seized the opportunity in time and tore through the orc formation, laying the foundation for the victory of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency Earl, please accept that I represent the Principality of Moxi, and give you the highest respect! May the friendship between our two countries last forever! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Prime Minister Herceg bowed directly to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time Hudson did not evade. If it's just for himself, he can still be humble, but when it comes to the Alpha Kingdom, he can't refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Courtesy, it seems that the standard is very high, but it is still empty after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to being able to show off bragging, it is actually nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not in the Principality of Moxie. No matter how many such honorary things are, it will not involve real interests. Naturally, everyone does not mind promoting him a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, you are welcome. Our two countries are originally allies, and the friendship between the two countries is even more obvious to the Lord of the Dawn. I just performed my duty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle last night was mainly due to the joint efforts of the two countries to achieve a brilliant victory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he wants to act, he doesn't mind accompanying him to the end. What is false is false after all, and those things that have not been fulfilled in the promises will still be fulfilled after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Last night's brilliant victory is now in the past tense. Next, the Principality will face more severe challenges, and we must look forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Hudson, the Beamon cavalry stopped thirty miles away from us. The reinforcements from the five royal families of the orcs are also halfway there at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this complicated situation, what is your solution? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the prime minister said, Hudson was also secretly surprised. The senior officials of the Principality of Moxi, who seem to be united, also have internal struggles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    has been catching him to praise him, and it is obvious that he wants to use the influence of his chief minister to suppress the limelight of Earl Martins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this kind of struggle is not fierce from the current point of view. They are all plots, and the starting point is not necessarily what they want to do to Earl Martins, but to maintain the current political balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The army of orcs is approaching menacingly, but they came separately, this is the opportunity left for us to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrate superior forces, destroy one of them first, hit the morale of the enemy, and then slowly consume with the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But before that, it's better to get rid of the Beamon cavalry thirty miles away, lest they sneak attack on our back during the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends on the speed of the arrival of reinforcements from all walks of life in your country before you can formulate the most suitable plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you can't beat it, can't you run?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the cavalry of the Principality of Moxi are in place, there are only three cavalry regiments + a few knight regiments in one joint army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Head-on confrontation with the Behemoth Legion is okay. If you want to encircle and wipe out the opponent, you don't even think about it. With such a small number of cavalry, they couldn't afford to encircle them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are not stupid. Since they came here separately, there is a high probability that they are prepared. Unless the Eagles flying all over the sky are dealt with first, it will be difficult to defeat Zhenxin one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to take a risky battle, but in the current situation, the Principality of Moxi simply cannot afford a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who has just stepped into the upper circle, is also unwilling to press down on his family's hard-won status and take military adventures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't find a fighter, you can only wait. Three hundred thousand troops were wiped out at once, even if they were all cannon fodder troops, it would not be able to replenish in a short while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information provided by the Moxi people, among the five-way reinforcements of the Orc Empire, the army of the Bearman Royal Court is the most powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson is not afraid that the orcs will come fast, but he is afraid that they will deliberately slow down the march and control the arrival time on the same day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five-way army gathered, together with the Beamon Cavalry Corps, it was another large-scale battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know why, but now that the \"big battle\" is mentioned, Hudson feels a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the strength of the expeditionary force and the large army gathered by the Mosi people, it is not a big problem to defend Dapes, and the hope of winning a big victory is really slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military plan has not been worked out, but several emergency plans have been prepared. But those have little to do with Hudson. If the situation deteriorates to the point of getting out of hand, the expeditionary force will not have as many concerns as the Moxie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Declined the Moxi people's retention, returned to the camp, and the final casualty report of last night's battle also came into Hudson's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As he expected, there were almost ten thousand casualties. Fortunately, most of the wounded were rescued. After a few days of rest and nutrition, they became a group of good soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final number of attrition was 6,376, of which 5,827 were determined to have died in battle, and the rest of the unlucky ones didn't know whether they got lost or got on the orc's barbecue grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the cavalry clean up the nearby routs, and search for missing persons by the way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter Beamon cavalry on the road, don't tangle with them and return to the camp immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered with a blank face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he was successful, he led the troops to fight for more than half a year. He was used to seeing life and death, and now he has developed a \"heart of stone\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being soft-hearted can't solve any problems. The most important thing now is to find a way to get rid of the orc so that he can go back to be his noble lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force lost a lot, but gained even more. The immature recruits, after the baptism of last night's battle, can be considered to have seen the \"big scene\" now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the past, the soldiers have obviously increased their aura, and their temperament has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This change is most familiar to Hudson. It's just that in the past, it would only appear after several times of fighting, but this time the one-night battle took place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, it is still a brutal battle, which can best create a strong soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the expeditionary force has decreased, but the recruits have transformed into veterans, and the combat effectiveness has increased slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deafening shouts of killing resounded throughout the world, and the assembled army of the Warhammer Kingdom launched an attack on the orc infantry camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, arrows rained all over the sky, and flying stones rolled down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Magic Crystal Cannon also popped up to join in the fun at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only sporadic magic crystal cannons, only the human army has equipment, and the orc army that came all the way with light vehicles can't bring these big things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was so easy to surround the orc infantry, Joseph couldn't believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was like a dream, as if the orcs suddenly had water in their minds and let them fiddle with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the orc cavalry didn't rush over for reinforcements, but instead wreaked havoc even more recklessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the news from various places, the enemy seems to want to bypass us and go all the way north to cooperate with the orc army in the north to open the gap! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military Affairs Minister Thiago's words were like a basin of cold water that poured a chill on Joseph II who was in joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The script was not prepared this way. The original plan was to besiege the orc infantry, attract the orc cavalry to help, and then fight them decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't expect the siege plan to be completed soon, but the orc cavalry played their cards out of common sense and played \"you fight yours, I'll fight mine\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of 30,000 infantry orcs is enough, but the northern defense line cannot be lost by the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orc army breaks through, the present of the Principality of Mosi is the future of the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even their situation will be even worse. The Orc Empire's emphasis on the Warhammer Kingdom is obviously more than one level higher than that of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A strong line of defense, that is only for external enemies. If there is an enemy coming out from the back, it will be another scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we annihilate the orc army in the encirclement first, and then return to the northern defense line, will there be enough time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The minister of military affairs did not speak, but the prime minister said first: \"Your Majesty, it is not just a question of whether it is too late, but what the orcs want to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the orc cavalry marched northward, but they also did not forget to carry out destruction along the way, burning houses, destroying farmland, and expelling the people...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the places they passed were reduced to ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces along the way can basically be declared abolished. If this situation continues, there will not be an inch of pure land in the entire Warhammer Great Plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation of the kingdom has been shaken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And the millions of refugees who are on the move, now also a new threat. In some areas, there have even been farces of refugees storming noble castles to grab food. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual situation is more serious than what Prime Minister Guy said. The destruction of the local economy will directly weaken the Warhammer Kingdom's war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct consequence is that the logistics support of the army will not be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the fertile Warhammer Great Plains, only the mountainous provinces in the west of the kingdom could not afford the huge material consumption of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the accumulation of the nobles is emptied, it is still a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assistance of allies is also hopeless. Even if everyone is willing to donate generously, it will be difficult to transport the supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most remote kingdom of the human race, although the Warhammer Kingdom has escaped countless internal disputes, it is difficult to obtain help from various countries in times of crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to deliver supplies, you will inevitably borrow from the Principality of Orton or the Principality of Moxi. Not to mention the long distance, the current situation of the two countries simply has no spare capacity to help them organize transportation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inventory can be consumed in a short period of time, but once this kind of idleness continues, it will be a matter of time before the Warhammer Kingdom collapses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Transformed from a military issue to an economic issue, Joseph II's head became bigger and bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, he suddenly understood why the orc infantry could easily siege them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the successive problems in the rear, the logistics of the 700,000 troops assembled are slowly being eaten away by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of destructive destruction is much more effective than the simple method of robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the besieged orc infantry can be dragged on for a while, the 700,000 army will collapse by itself because of food and grass problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thought he had insight into the enemy's conspiracy, Joseph II was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to gather the 700,000 troops, the military forces of several provinces in the rear have been evacuated. Facing the long drive of the orc cavalry, there was almost no way to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the left-behind nobles stick to the castle, they cannot stop the advance of the orc army. Cavalry is not suitable for attacking cities, but it does not mean that they cannot drive serfs to attack cities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't expect everyone to be tough. With a knife on your neck, there will always be someone willing to cooperate with the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Duke Daniel banned massacres and used refugees to cause trouble for the Warhammer Kingdom, this war has become different from before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Warhammer Kingdom not only needs to provide food and supplies for the army, but also find ways to relieve refugees. If any link is not done well, it will become a huge thunder, blowing up this ancient kingdom to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they knew earlier, the orcs would play like this. Joseph II would never gather an army and run over to fight them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troops were scattered all over the place, and although they couldn't block the orc's front, it was absolutely impossible for the enemy's cavalry to move so smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for at least a dozen cavalrymen to drive thousands of serfs to destroy and even besiege noble castles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being able to divide troops arbitrarily means that the enemy's destruction speed will be greatly reduced, and they can also gain more time for emergency preparations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is no if in reality. If it is really a new start, Joseph II may not be able to withstand the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he initiated the Atreus provincial battle, but in fact it was a joint effort of various interest groups in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made everyone's foundation on the Warhammer Great Plains?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without struggling hard, who would be willing to abandon the family business and evacuate to the west to resist?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People leave their hometowns and are humble, and the same is true for nobles. Without the support of the foundation, even with the strategic transfer of the army, their right to speak in the kingdom will be greatly weakened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are full of variables, no matter how strong your hands are, if you lose follow-up strength supplements, you will only get weaker and weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After recovering the lost ground after the war, the original foundation has nothing to do with the frustrated people like them. If you are lucky, you can get some compensation and appeasement. If you are not lucky, you will not even be eligible to live to that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interests determine the position. Marshal Borg was able to insist on abandoning the Warhammer Great Plains and retreating to the western mountains because he was the spokesperson for the interests of the nobles in the western provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II can't, the foundation of the royal family is in the Great Plains of Warhammer, and the core supporters are also in the Great Plains of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to give up the foundation directly, maybe before the orcs come, the people under your hands will start to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Individuals cannot go against the general trend, even if they know the risks ahead are huge, they can only bite the bullet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the question is raised, it is because their foundation is being destroyed by the orc cavalry, and they are in urgent need of rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If we give up...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just halfway through speaking, Joseph II forcibly swallowed the rest of the words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to let go of the encirclement, but these tens of thousands of orc infantry will turn into brown sugar and follow them all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the army shows a slight flaw, these enemies will bite at the first time. They are all elites, and once they make a move, the loss to the army will definitely not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is even more impossible to divide the troops and go north for reinforcements. The mobility of infantry is far less than that of cavalry. It is estimated that they only took a few days to divide their troops, and the orc cavalry turned their guns and came back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the cooperation of the inside and the outside, most of the remaining army will be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Busy with a loss of soldiers and generals, and let yourself fall into strategic passiveness, that is a serious blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, after the war, the balance of power between the two sides will also change, and the situation will worsen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there no good news?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I have just received news from the Principality of Moxi that they have defeated the orc army that besieged Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they can withstand the counterattack of the orc reinforcements in the next big battle, the situation in the Principality of Moxi can be stabilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was also good news from the Alpha Kingdom. After breaking through three lines of defense, the orc army was finally stopped by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that a counterattack was launched, which defeated three main orc armies and wiped out more than 200,000 orc armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first batch of reinforcements supported by the Terran Alliance have all set off now. A total of 300,000 elite troops will arrive in the Principality of Moxi within two months at the earliest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the alliance meeting also approved the previous proposal of the Alpha Kingdom, and the major forces will send experts to reinforce the front line first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The support is strong this time, and all forces with parliamentary seats must send at least one earth knight or magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One vote represents a master, and the top forces also promised to send sky knights to participate in the battle. These masters will arrive one after another in a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once these forces are in place, we will completely suppress the Orc Empire with high-end forces. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Secretary Cassidy unhurriedly released a big thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone who was worried that the situation would get out of hand suddenly found that they could still be rescued. As long as you persist until the arrival of reinforcements, the deteriorating situation may be restored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is the distribution of reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 300,000 elite army is not a small number, it has already surpassed the entire military strength of many countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the outbreak of the war, among the many forces of the human race, there were only five with a standing army of more than 300,000, and there was only the Alpha Kingdom in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are many reinforcements, and there are many countries that cannot hold back and need reinforcements. After everyone divides it, there is not much left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many reinforcements did the kingdom get?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The original passive response plan must naturally become a little more positive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, if you command these troops, can you encircle and wipe out the Beamon Army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg's expected question directly confused Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handing over all the cavalry to him, the guest general, was commanding him, which was a little too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being a little dazed, Hudson quickly understood what was going on. \"Foreign missionaries like to chant scriptures\" is also applicable in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Moxi Principality, the Alpha Kingdom is a big country. As a general of the Alpha Kingdom, he would have been looked down upon by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was the previous defeat of Crown Prince Caesar, it would not affect Hudson's \"famous general halo\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are ready-made famous generals, so there is no need to take the risk of using generals without outstanding records. In case of encountering a scammer like Crown Prince Caesar, the Principality of Moxi couldn't afford to bet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, if you want to annihilate a Beamon cavalry army in a field battle, unless they make a big mistake themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if they have tens of times the number of troops to besiege, they can still run ahead of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So to annihilate the Beamon Army, the key to the problem is not on our side, but on whether the enemy generals are willing to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if you can lower your expectations, just defeat them, or drive them away, there is still hope. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson dared to be so calm. Naturally, the orc reinforcements slowed down their marching speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, it wasn't that they deliberately slowed down their teammates, but that the Mosi followed the example of the expeditionary force and destroyed their way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many baggage drags, and the other orc reinforcements are relatively slightly less affected. The exact time of arrival is uncertain, but it will definitely be a few days later than the normal march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days in normal times are nothing, but a few days now can change the fate of the Bimon Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then leave this to Earl Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg's straightforward words made Hudson dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are Moxi people so straightforward? He just analyzed it. When did he say he would agree?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carefully looked at Prime Minister Herceg, trying to find flaws in his expression, but unfortunately, he found nothing in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the ministers of Moxi nearby raised no objections. It was clear that it was discussed in advance, and he was waiting for him to enter the set.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it's okay to command a large army to fight, the key is to negotiate the \"price\" first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are three cavalry regiments + four knight regiments on the side of the human coalition army, and there is also a palace knight regiment. The overall strength is definitely higher than that of the Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it is still possible to draw some noble knights from the army to join the battle, plus the masters of the families in the Principality of Moxi. As long as they don't command blindly, there is almost no possibility of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the Mosi people had lost too much food and lacked confidence in their generals, Hudson would definitely not be able to do such a good job that is easy to earn military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price to be paid to defeat the Beamon Army, it is no longer a problem at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all political needs. The arrival time of the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance is clear, and the Moxi people have to show in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to let the alliance think that as long as more reinforcements are sent over, they will be able to turn around immediately and revitalize the entire battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some hesitation, Hudson finally decided to help. Think of it as contributing to the cause of the human race against the orcs, and don't care about that much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's no problem for me to command the army, but during the execution of the mission, all combatants must strictly abide by the military orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who disobeys the military order will be punished on the spot. You can't wait for your country's aristocratic council to go through the procedure! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing topic. The question of whether nobles should be executed on the spot for violating military orders has always been a controversial topic in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are both supporters and opponents. It was submitted to the aristocratic council several times for consideration, but was finally rejected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this kind of controversy mainly stems from the differences between the king and several big nobles, and the small and medium nobles below are just sloppy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are a local nobleman of the Principality of Moxi, if you dare to make this request, you will be criticized immediately and doubt your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is different. In the Alpha Kingdom, special wartime laws have long been implemented. In ordinary times, nobles commit crimes that require the approval of the noble council before they can be executed, except on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are precedents, and it is not abrupt to bring them up again. What's more, there is also the support of the Human Race Alliance Code, which does not lack legal basis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The embarrassing atmosphere didn't last long, and all the representatives of the great nobles of the Principality of Moxi nodded their heads to express their agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is a smart person, and they are very aware of the current situation, and they are not allowed to continue to be willful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is coaxing or lying, the reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance must be fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the three northern countries are all competitors. Which country the reinforcements go to help first means that the situation in that country can be reversed faster and its own losses will be minimized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Move the capital and fight again, resist to the death...\" are just slogans. If it really develops to that stage, the tragedy of the world will happen in front of your eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation is burned, the vitality is greatly injured, the class falls, and everything is reshuffled. These are not what the vested interests want to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting the authorization, Hudson was not polite, and directly began to issue orders: \"Send the order, settle down and rest for a day, and start a decisive battle with the orcs tomorrow morning!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify all officers above the regiment level that in two hours, I will hold a military meeting on this tower. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The vigorous and resolute style really shocked the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi, and then they breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is not afraid of Hudson's decisiveness in killing and attacking, but they are afraid of the indecision of the commander he invited. The more resolute the performance, the more convincing it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if Hudson's face is older, preferably in his fifties or sixties, it will be more reassuring for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thirty miles away, in the camp of the Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the news that the reinforcements would be delayed, Prince Butzweig was furious. I was in a bad mood, but now it's getting worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements could not arrive in time, which means that in the next few days, the Beamon Army will fight alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't panic at all two days ago, that's because the Mosi army was still on the way, and the cavalry regiment + court knights in the hands of the expeditionary army was still not in his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting today, the situation has changed radically. With the addition of two cavalry legions and four knights, the human race already has the strength to threaten the Beamon legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is not all. There is also a knight order among the noble coalition forces of the southern provinces who were bullied by him earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavalry against cavalry, if you want to rely on the advantage of high mobility, it is not so simple to come and go freely on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Satuk, send someone to urge the reinforcements from all walks of life, and tell them that if they don't come, I will leave with the team first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are angry words, but also his sincere words. Prince Butzweig, who was acting as a bait, really didn't want to do it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost 300,000 cannon fodder, and the merits and demerits can still be offset, so the previous military exploits are in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose the Behemoth Legion in your hand, it will really be over. Even if he is a descendant of Emperor Bimon, he cannot escape the punishment of the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the Beamon clan sparsely populated?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the people are soldiers, there are only a few troops, and they simply cannot afford such a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speaker has no intention, but the listener has a heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said angrily, but his subordinates really began to think about how to lead the team to escape safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, it may not be easy for us to evacuate now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they can make a big circle and deliberately avoid the human army in the Dapes area, they will definitely intercept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that, more time needs to be wasted. The increased distance is not necessarily safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We don't carry much rations, if the delay is too long, it is easy to bring the army into danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly rushing to meet the imperial reinforcements is also dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the intelligence, the human race has destroyed the road leading to the northern border. If we are not careful, we will be blocked by the human race army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They now have an absolute superiority in military strength, if they directly confront them head-on, they may suffer a big loss!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If His Royal Highness really wants to transfer, the best choice is to avoid the reality and just turn around and enter the Principality of Orton, and then enter the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle over there is also very tense right now. If we can help in the past, it will definitely be of great help to the empire's strategy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark offered advice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A counselor is anxious about what the master is anxious about, and worrying about the master's worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of a sudden change in the situation, Prince Butzweig would naturally not refuse to add such a retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bait, he is still qualified. Not only a large number of active forces from the Principality of Moxi were attracted, but also the expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next step is to close the net. Whether you can eat up the military power of these human races depends on the performance of your teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road was damaged, and the marching time was forced to be extended. I can't blame my teammates for this. But as a result of this, asking him to pay the bill would be cheating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at his counselor, Prince Butzweig nodded slightly and said, \"Let's list this plan as an option for now!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait and see the situation first, if it is really irreversible, come back to discuss this issue. In any case, we can't easily...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He speaks tough, but deep in his heart, he has already begun to consider whether to adopt this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are you afraid of, what are you coming to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the morning, the first ray of sun shines. A group of Behemoths were busy lighting a fire and cooking, when suddenly the ground trembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers with a little bit of experience can easily tell that this is a sign of the arrival of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court's reinforcements were still on the way, but the enemy came to the door first. Prince Butzweig was also furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he received the news of the dispatch of the human army in advance, the buffer time was still too short, and there was no time for any military deployment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army is ready for war!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to fight or not is a tangled question. However, this embarrassing scene did not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human army that appeared in the sky was making a decision for Prince Butzweig. The leader was none other than Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less than 4,000 words, I really can't hold it anymore, so I need to sleep first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson's name is well-known in the Orc Empire, and has dominated the reward list for many days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they live in seclusion, they have ushered in several waves of assassins. Perhaps in order to attract more killers to participate, or perhaps an intelligence error, the Earth Bear was omitted from the information on the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, a group of foolish killers rushed in. Before they understood what was going on, they were picked out by the cubs and used as toys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the success rate of this kind of assassination of enemy generals has always been very low. For a cautious king like Hudson who goes in and out of the army, the assassin doesn't even have a chance to get close.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination can be successful, either by sneaking into the coach's side, or launching a sneak attack while he is out to place orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar means, the Alpha Kingdom has already paid the tuition fees before. Now Mr. Hudson is surrounded by his own trusted guards, not even a maid, let alone let the orcs mix in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, the human cavalry has arrived, and the leader seems to be that **** Hudson. Let me take the team out and show them some color!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greg stepped forward to ask for a fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from his red eyes that he is full of hatred for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, then you will lead the troops to take the lead. Send the order, open the gate of the camp and attack with the whole army!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig ordered solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no word \"defense\" in Beamon's dictionary, especially in this kind of field encounter, there is no reason to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at their camp, you can tell that it is not a suitable place for defense. The most important thing is that the situation does not allow them to stick to it. Although there are only human cavalry outside now, the infantry may follow after a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you confine yourself to the camp and lose the high mobility of the cavalry, it will only be a matter of time before the entire army is destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the distance between the two sides continues to narrow, the peak collision of the two powerhouses will soon kick off in this wilderness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The crossbowman is ready, wait for the opportunity to find the target to shoot, don't be polite to Beamon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's commanding way is very unspeakable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this battle, he took away all the miniature crossbows of the Mosi people. Especially those magic crossbows are weapons of war that can pierce the armor of heavy cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sound of arrows piercing through the air came out, and the Beamon cavalry rushing forward were almost shot into a sieve. The leader of the beast, Greg, went to see the beast **** before he understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Prince Butzweig's expression changed drastically. It's too careless, the cavalry duel actually plays with magic technology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What worries him even more is that these humble miniature magic crossbows can burst out with such power when gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If in the future, the human cavalry is equipped with a pair of magic crossbows, how can they be better than the Mongolian cavalry on the mainland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it necessary to continue to thicken the armor and enhance the defense of the soldiers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or replace ordinary armor with high-defense magic armor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These two options are a disaster for the Bimon family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armor continues to thicken, which means that the mobility will be further reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic armor is good for everything, but the cost is high and the output is low. They are all handmade by alchemists, and there is no possibility of mass production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrow flying from his forehead brought Prince Butzweig back to reality. The fate of the Beamon family should be considered in the future, and the most important thing now is to get through the current hurdle first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying the price of hundreds of cavalry losses, the two armies finally collided together, and in an instant, the famous scene of people turning their backs on their backs and beasts turning their backs on their backs was staged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Human Knights!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This idea had just been born, and Prince Butzweig dropped the idea of ​​defeating the cavalry in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, they are all enemies on horses, the difference in appearance is not big, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between knights and cavalry before the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's decision to let the Cavaliers take the lead is undoubtedly wise. In the brutal collision on the battlefield, the Beamon cavalry only had a slight advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then this advantage is not enough for them to make up for their disadvantage in strength. After a round of head-on confrontation penetrated, hundreds of Beamon cavalrymen were added to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of human cavalry killed in battle was actually even more, but it was not very eye-catching under the superiority of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army turned their horses around, and the word \"kill\" was shouted from Hudson's mouth. The knights charged again, followed by countless cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A new round of power collision occurred, and the battle scene became more and more bloody. In the collision between barbarism and civilization, it has become civilization that has the upper hand at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two rounds of peak duels, plus the hundreds of people who were taken away by the rain of arrows, the Beamon cavalry has lost more than a thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Prince Butzweig, who was hiding in the army, secretly said, \"Oops!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he wanted to take Hudson's head off, rationality eventually prevailed. After the second round of confrontation, he no longer turned the animal's head, and directly ordered to the soldiers: \"Follow me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he led the troops and started running without looking back. By the time Hudson turned his horse's head, the distance between the two sides had increased to hundreds of meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the fleeing Beamon cavalry, Hudson only felt a little unreal. This time he didn't have to hang up, and Mr. Bear Stearns slept on his shoulder from the beginning to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Chase!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Beamon cavalry withdrew, the outcome of this battle was decided in advance. It's rare to have this kind of opportunity to beat a dog in the water, so naturally I can't let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hacking one to death counts as one. For a race with a sparse population like Bimon, killing is the best strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the plain land, there was a scene of chasing and fleeing. In theory, chasing Beamon cavalry now is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a prairie after all. The avenue is only a few meters wide and cannot accommodate too many cavalry. The fleeing Bimon cavalry will inevitably trample on the farmland on both sides of the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there are still a few pits in the farmland along the way. It is inevitable that the beast stumbles occasionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real meaning of this pursuit is to kill these unlucky ones who have accidents. Of course, it does not rule out that the Beamon officer was unlucky and led the troops into a certain \"dead end\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plain land, it's just that the land as a whole is flat, it doesn't mean that all the land is on the same horizon without any obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, a few small dirt bumps appear, a narrow road emerges, or a canyon or river appears, all of which are possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the Eagle Man circling in the distant sky, Hudson cursed secretly, \"Unlucky!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With these guys guiding the way in the sky, expecting the enemy to lead the army into a \"dead end\" is basically a dead end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An opportunity to wipe out the Beamon Cavalry Corps just slipped away in his hands, but the hunt still had to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thirty miles, fifty miles, one hundred miles... During the chase and escape battle, they ran to the border of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop chasing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson stopped the chasing team with a wave of his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't continue to chase, even if I have the blood of a monster, the endurance of the horse is still limited after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous pursuit, there were not a few horses that were exhausted to death. Now even Hudson's own war horse is exhausted and out of breath, and if it continues to chase, it might die again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying such a high price, the results obtained are not cheap. The Beamon Cavalry Legion, which fled in a hurry, has now been severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that half of them escaped into the Principality of Orton, so they are lucky. The rest were either separated during the chase and escape battle, or were sent to meet the beast god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A group of remnants and defeated generals, I guess the Principality of Orton should be able to solve it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said to himself somewhat uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really not that he wants to cheat the Principality of Orton, but the enemy is running there with all his heart, and he can't stop it even if he wants to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Beamon cavalry were a little more honest and ran to join the reinforcements, Hudson can guarantee that even if they can't destroy their entire army, they can also destroy their establishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running to other countries has a similar ending. As long as the troops of the neighboring countries stop them a little bit, this group of Bimons will be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the Duchy of Orton is an exception. In the previous battles, he had already been severely injured by the human-orc expeditionary force, and now he was in a state of defenselessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to keep a core area where the capital is located is considered a very hard work. For border defense, let's save money first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After resting on the spot for two days, Hudson ordered the army to return. Resting for such a long time is not only to let the soldiers relax the tense time, but also to worry about the return of the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that he was simply overthinking. The Beamon Cavalry Corps who fled into the Principality of Orton just rested for one night, and then continued to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the route of the march, either they are consolidating some of the Principalities of Orton, or they are preparing to enter the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the situation is, it seems that they have cheated their teammates. Let the Moxi people deal with this kind of thing, anyway, the battle is won.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although thousands of cavalry were lost and tens of thousands of war horses were wasted, but in the face of the record of the Beamon Cavalry Corps, everything is not worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there are not many enemies wiped out, but another way of saying it is different: 1.5% of the population of the Beamon clan has been wiped out, and all of them are young and strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War Qualitative Hudson has already thought about it, a big victory of great \"strategic significance\". It is definitely enough to take it out and brag about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the speed of the wind when they came, when they returned, they turned from cavalry to infantry, and they swayed slowly at a speed of fifty miles a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. When chasing Beamon cavalry, they always galloped wildly. The nasty horse that was originally used for transportation was naturally discarded behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of overuse of horses have broken out one after another in the past two days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is a world with extraordinary power. The specially made magic potion saved the lives of many horses, otherwise these cavalry might really become infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no need to hurry, so it is natural to cherish horsepower. Intuition told Hudson that these highly effective magic potions were not good products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but he always feels that the continent of Aslant is off the tech tree. All healing magic is at the cost of consuming the vitality of the wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the treatment potion is not much better, but any potion that can be effective immediately needs to pay a price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Beamon camp of the Principality of Orton, Prince Butzweig, who received the news of Hudson's withdrawal, finally breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could be happy, the casualty data reported by his subordinates shattered his good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the half-numbered officers in the camp, Prince Butzweig said in a low tone: \"The failure of this battle is mainly because we underestimated the power of the human race. After all, the hegemony of the mainland is not so easy to shake!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you have also felt that, although the combat effectiveness of the Terran Knights is slightly weaker than ours, they have almost made up for this gap by virtue of their superiority in weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even those human cavalry, led by the Knights, can cause us a lot of casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will be responsible for the explanation at the imperial court, and I will not hold you accountable for the defeat, but I hope that everyone will learn from it and restrain their pretentious arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must always remember that our enemy is not a weak slime, but the overlord who dominates the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the enemy is powerful, the heroic Beamon...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beating the generals under his command again, and boosting morale, Prince Butzweig is also fighting now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the easy words, he will handle it in the imperial court. But the orc empire is cruel, and the internal competition of the Beamon clan is not much worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a big defeat, he will never be relentless in catching his braided competitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the army hanging out alone now, maybe the command authority would be lifted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that if he didn't perform well in the future, at least he would have to peel off his skin after returning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, judging from the current situation, this operation against the Principality of Moxi may not be able to achieve its original purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to send people to contact the reinforcements from all walks of life, and invite them to come down to the south and join us, so that everyone can join forces and enter the Kingdom of Warhammer together. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clark suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a counselor, his fate is closely related to Prince Butzweig. If something goes wrong with the boss, his younger brother will also be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the orc royal family's discrimination against these vassal races, it is not easy to meet a boss like Prince Butzweig who can listen to persuasion. Even if you want to change the court, it is not feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's too late, if the strength of the army has not been damaged. It is indeed a good way to invite reinforcements from all walks of life to enter the Kingdom of Warhammer together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, even if we can join forces, the right to speak we can get will not be high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they won a big victory in the Warhammer Kingdom, it would be difficult to make up for the impact of this defeat. There is only one way left for us, and that is to go all the way south and disturb the hinterland of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the human race in the northern continent is not too strong. Except for the Kingdom of Alpha, the Kingdom of Warhammer and the Principality of Moxi, the rest are a group of small countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength in our hands, we can completely cause a big chaos. Duke Daniel has set an example for us, and we just have to follow the example.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order continues, and then all human villages and small towns will be destroyed, and all the serfs and civilians on these lands will be driven out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We need a refugee wave, a large-scale refugee wave that can shake the rule of the human race in the north! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make a comeback from the Jedi, you must use a strange move. According to the normal style of play, no matter how he behaves next, it will be difficult for him to gain enough exploits to cover up his previous defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, it is not difficult to set off a wave of refugees to disrupt the human nations, but relying on these alone, the imperial court may not be able to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we can spread chaos all the way to the middle of the continent, effectively weakening the war potential of the human race. only…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the middle-aged general finished speaking, he was interrupted by Prince Butzweig with a wave. It is not that simple to spread chaos to the middle of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human kingdoms in the middle are not fools. It is estimated that before they get close, their army will kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just suffered a severe beating by a human cavalry, no Behemoth can guarantee that this half-disabled legion can withstand the military blow of a kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The wave of refugees does not necessarily have to enter the central part of the continent, the same is true for driving refugees into the Alpha Kingdom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the size of the refugee wave is large enough to cause trouble for the countries in the middle of the ethnic group, that would be even better! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you, the ethereal leader, I owe more +1, and strive to pay back soon, love you Haiyue!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If there is a fight, it is still unknown who will win and who will lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hope at all if you want to break through the city of Dapes. On the contrary, they continued to rush over with their heads sullen, and could easily be defeated one by one by the human coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the security guaranteed, the dignitaries in the city naturally cheered up again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the disaster that the Beamon Army will bring to the allies when it goes south, everyone really doesn't care about thinking so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the biggest hero, Hudson felt the enthusiasm of the Moxi people before stepping into the city of Dapac.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crown prince personally led a group of princes and ministers to wait at the gate of the city, and the etiquette specifications were all in accordance with the highest standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king hadn't been ill in bed, it is estimated that the one who led the team out to greet him now would be Chris IX himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the majestic scene, Hudson shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this victory is important, it is not worthy of this kind of treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Making the scene so grand seems to be a way of paying attention to the heroes, but it is actually a kind of compensation for changing tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fame and profit cannot be obtained at the same time. Now that you have gained fame, then your actual benefits will inevitably be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing to disappoint. At Hudson's current position, the Moxi people really don't have much to offer him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False titles are not enough to reward credit, not to mention they are a principality, so it is impossible to give too high a title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people are willing to give the fief, but the problem is that Hudson is not interested in changing jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of a fiefdom, he ran over to guard the gate for the Moxi people. He is not crazy yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the Moxi nobles who are very enthusiastic about him now, and everyone who commands the army is also very cooperative, and his reputation is even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is that he is a guest army. No matter how high the prestige is, it must return to the Alpha Kingdom in the end, and will not crowd out everyone's core interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is happy to come over to add to the icing on the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you jump ship and develop, it will be another set of scripts. The original friend has become a competitor, and not stabbing a knife in the back is taking the overall situation into consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resources can't be counted on either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The precious cultivation resources were all divided up by the nobles and the royal family, leaving only a bunch of high-end goods in the treasury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was a year or two ago, Hudson would still be hot-eyed; now, he won't even take a second look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the base is large enough, he is still happy to take it back to train his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this is simply impossible. The little inventory in the treasury is not enough to reward my family, so how could it be outflowed in large quantities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are definitely gold coin rewards, but most of them are bonds. The theoretical benefits are quite good, but whether they can be realized is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that the Mosi people have learned the essence of \"borrowing\" and carried it forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want the bounty to be honored, you can only make persistent efforts to help the Principality of Moxi keep its foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was already a pile of bonds in his hands, and he didn't know how to spend them. Now that there are more piles, Hudson doesn't know how to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bitter fruit planted by oneself has to be swallowed even if the front teeth are knocked out. Maybe after the situation becomes clear, find someone who has been taken advantage of to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the financial industry in the mainland of Aslant is not developed enough, and there is no bond trading market, so it is very difficult to sell gloves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary chambers of commerce, even if they are rich, would not dare to accept this kind of offer. Only powerful nobles are not afraid of the Moxi people repudiating their debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson found that he seemed to have buried a huge thunder, once it was detonated, it would definitely be a landslide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hurry up, move faster for me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone looks weak, haven't you eaten yet?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fool, this rock is too big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Carry it over foolishly, do you want to use it as a tombstone for yourself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are you still doing in a daze, break it up quickly, do you want me to help you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc soldiers are used to the cursing voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when Bruno, the commander-in-chief, became the captain of the construction brigade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just started to fill a hole, move forward one step. Later, it was found that the speed was too slow, so the soldiers were simply asked to repair the road first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this group of five big and three rough guys, asking them to kill people with knives is a professional level; as for road construction, they haven't started yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amateur construction teams always have accidents. In order to complete engineering tasks, it is a common phenomenon to cut corners and get things done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct consequence is that it hurts the team behind, and if you don't pay attention, it will be an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless horses have been tossed and ruined along the way. Bruno is also a ruthless person. If the horse is gone, the orc will be replaced to pull the cart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficiency is a little lower, but the orderly progress of the baggage team is still guaranteed on the whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make up for the reduced efficiency, Bruno himself turned into a contractor, inspecting the project site while directing soldiers to build roads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all temporarily transferred from work. Amateur contractors were paired with amateur construction teams. Regardless of the quality of the project, the efficiency was not so high anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lower the efficiency, the more Bruno loves to point fingers; the more he runs to point fingers, the lower the construction efficiency will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the vicious circle, road repair works have not been smooth. Seeing that the pre-arranged time passed, Bruno became more and more angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Urgent report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Urgent report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the guidance of the soldiers along the way, the Eagle Scout trotted all the way, and finally arrived in front of Bruno.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"General, urgent report from the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon Legion was defeated under the siege of the human army, and has now retreated to the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig told you to be careful of the plots of the human race, and don't fall into their schemes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Eagle scout could finish speaking, Bruno interrupted angrily: \"Enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to fight, I know myself. There is no need for a defeated general to point fingers at me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell Prince Butzweig, let him take care of himself first! Don't inadvertently become the first Behemoth army wiped out by the human race since the start of the war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the orc empire, only the strong have the qualifications to be respected. It turned out that Bruno bought Prince Butzweig's account because of his great military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has changed. The illustrious Prince Butzweig suffered consecutive defeats, first losing 300,000 besieging troops, and now even the direct descendants of the Beamon Legion are being chased and fled by the human race. Naturally, Bruno is not qualified to continue to respect him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the unsatisfactory journey along the way, he accumulated a lot of anger, and now he can no longer suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong's temper got on his head, he didn't care if he was a prince or not. Everyone doesn't live in a royal family, and they are not even considered as colleagues, so there is no need to give so much face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vented a wave of grievances, Bruno had to face reality. The defeat of the Behemoth Legion directly put the reinforcements of the Bearman Imperial Court in an embarrassing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to move on, this is a question that needs to be pondered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's one thing to like Mang, but it doesn't mean Bruno is a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the Beamon Legion, he didn't have the guts to lead the team to the Terran Allied Forces alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Bruno shouted loudly: \"Guards, send someone to contact the other armies, I need to know their next movements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send another person to report the current situation to the imperial court, and ask His Majesty Xiong Huang to decide whether to continue marching! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar scene was also staged in the other four orc armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bait, eaten by the enemy and wiped clean. No one can be sure whether closing the net can gain anything now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risks and benefits of continuing to send troops are completely out of proportion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the imperial court can send more reinforcements, if it continues, it will be a battle with an uncertain future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the city of Terence, the armies of the five royal families of the orcs gathered, and everyone used their wealth to launch the most violent attack on this fortress city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the ruthless orcs, the defenders' resistance seemed very weak. The current Terence City is like a dilapidated old house, crumbling in the wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, every time it came to a critical moment, the ancient city stood firm again. The orc army opened the gap several times, but was blocked by the defenders in the city with their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The highly respected Marshal Hodge has gray hair at the moment, as if he has aged twenty years suddenly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the menacing orcs, the nerves are tense all day long, and the pressure you need to bear can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this is yesterday's casualty report, a total of 3,246 officers and soldiers were killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are as many as eleven damaged places in the outer city. Although we have blocked the gap, the defense is still greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is expected that the next battle will be even more brutal. According to the enemy's current offensive strength, it is estimated that the outer city will fall within ten days. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halley said in a low tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Marshal Hodge's adjutant, he faces all kinds of data all day long, and he knows much more information than ordinary officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are like this, the more they know, the less happy they are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of deaths is four digits every day, and it continues to increase over time, and there is no hope of reinforcements at all, which is really not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was a war within the human race, it would have broken the city long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can persist until now, purely because the orc army has surrounded Terence with water, so they can only carry it to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is not so much defending the city as it is fighting against the beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outer city can persist because the inner city is too small to accommodate so many troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army waiting to defend the city is almost dead, and it's time to retreat to the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The estimate of ten days is completely the most optimistic estimate. With the increase of the gap, the number of daily casualties will increase significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of the enemy breaking the city wall in advance is almost 99%. The rest of the points, purely rely on the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, put the file here, you can go down and rest!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of defending the city, you don't have to worry too much. The situation has developed to this point, and we can only last one day at a time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, every day Terence sticks to is buying time for the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the orcs blocked the news and couldn't contact the capital, and they didn't know how far the situation in the principality had deteriorated. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge said exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hero is late, and even pessimistic about the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this point, no matter how the situation in the Principality of Moxi changes, Terence City will not be able to bring out reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they can hold on until the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance arrive, there may still be some room for maneuver.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the situation in the city will not change much, and you don't need to work too hard.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Harley spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the officers and soldiers defending the city are mentally prepared to die. Even if they wanted to break out, the orcs outside would not agree!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surrender, that is impossible. Not to mention losing everything at home, the key is that the reputation of the Orc Empire has long been wiped out by countless wars in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in the eyes of orcs, the reputation of human beings is almost at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how good the promise is in advance, it will be broken later. It doesn't matter once or twice, there will always be fools who will be fooled, and after a hundred or eighty times, fools are not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to surrendering as a traitor and finally going to the grill, it is better to fight to the death and pull a few backs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such circumstances, the morale of the defenders in the city is not high, but they are full of vigor to fight for their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the cannon fodder army, the fighting power that erupts at the critical moment of life and death can catch up to 30 to 40% of the elite troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hahaha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the city is alive, the city is broken and the people are dead!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Harley boy, you don't need to worry about me. I can't die until Terrance is taken by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for you, kid, wait for the opportunity when the time comes!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the city is broken, it is also the most chaotic time. If you want to break out, that is the best time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky enough to save your life, please deliver this letter to His Majesty the King for me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge's words made Harley's tears fall down uncontrollably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this letter was specially prepared for him. If there is no reason, breaking through and leaving alone, it will be difficult to explain clearly when going back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is one more letter, and that is to leave with a mission. No one can do anything to criticize him on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Full of feelings, finally gathered into two words: \"Marshal, I...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw Hodge reached out and patted his shoulder, and said with a smile: \"There is no need to say anything, I know your situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only seedling of the family, carrying the inheritance of the family blood, cannot just die here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your father and I are also old friends. He blocked an arrow for me back then, and now he will repay you kid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be so sad, the soldier's horse leather shroud is destiny. It is also an honor to be able to die on the battlefield against the orc invasion, and it is better than dying on the bed due to illness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next step is to test your achievements in these years of cultivation. Whether you can save your life from the hands of death depends on yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pray for the Lord of Dawn to bless you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Only he himself knew that the real hidden worry came from his father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bimenghuang's re-emergence greatly exceeded his expectations. With the appearance of Emperor Bimon, the network of personal connections that had been painstakingly managed was instantly shattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Chu Jun\", after all, there is still an extra word \"Chu\". Seeing that Emperor Bimon was old and strong, those who were planning to stand in line stopped in their tracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There have been too many negative cases in the past. Emperor Bimon survived the death of several crown princes, and adding another one is no big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"secret method of longevity\" that is widely spread among the human race is certainly released by the Alpha Kingdom, but Alex's help is also indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own plan is like a child's game in front of Emperor Bimon, and the success rate of comeback is frighteningly low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to follow in the footsteps of your elder brothers, you can only use external force. The emergence of the secret method of longevity is undoubtedly the best opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rumors are not terrible, what is terrible is that rumors are close to the truth. All Alex did was to process the information in his hands and reveal it after artistic processing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are the powerful people of the human race ready to move, but there are also many peepers inside the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for being intimidated by the majesty of Emperor Bimon in the past, and the war is still going on, it is not a good time for internal fighting, and the orc empire will not be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, Prince Butzweig has led an army to the Principality of Orton, and is out of danger now, so you don't need to worry too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest battle, although temporarily lost, but the situation is still under our control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's Terence line of defense has been almost taken down by me, and only the last few big cities are left. After pulling out these nails, it's time to settle with the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince's proposal is good. If we can't destroy the Principality of Moxi for the time being, let the army divert to destroy the Kingdom of Warhammer first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the refugee wave plan goes well, not only will we be able to take down the Warhammer Kingdom this time, but we will also be able to disrupt the rear of the Alpha Kingdom and disrupt their military deployment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you may be able to destroy the three northern countries in one fell swoop, and win the Northern Continent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time has come to test the relationship. It seems that he is trying to persuade Crown Prince Alex, but he is actually speaking for Prince Butzweig.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of personal connections, Prince Butzweig, who has been in the army all year round, has a much deeper foundation than Alex, the crown prince who eats, drinks and has fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all descendants of Emperor Bimon. It is still unknown who will be able to sit on the throne in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the current Emperor Beamon is particularly able to survive, maybe Alex, the last prince, will also meet the Beast God first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prince is gone, and it is the turn of the princes and grandchildren to compete for the position, so Prince Butzweig has an advantage. Even after experiencing a failure, he is still favored by many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, ask General Agustin for his opinion. If he thinks that the plan of crossing the Principality of Mosi and bypassing the Principality of Orton to enter the Warhammer Kingdom is feasible, then implement it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My old and immortal father has not been dealt with yet, and the group of juniors below are now restless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elder brothers met the Beast God in advance, but the contacts they managed remained behind. Prince Butzweig inherited the political legacy of a deceased crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex, who has endured countless years, will naturally not lack patience. Knowing that now is a good opportunity to suppress Prince Butzweig, he still chose to restrain himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many competitors, pressing one will not solve the problem at all. Going up to add insult to injury will only make the situation more passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the crown prince, he already has an advantage in righteousness, and he can just follow the trend, and there is no need to do things absolutely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most urgent task is to solve the threat posed by Emperor Beamon. Without this sharp sword hanging above the head, things will be easier to handle later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Emperor Beamon was too cautious and didn't give him a chance to do something. Now he can only hope that the peepers outside will give a little bit of strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex couldn't care less about the possible future troubles caused by this. Under the shroud of fear of death, his heart was on the verge of collapse every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all a bunch of trash!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is an idiot. Fortunately, they are still known as the world's number one cavalry, and they are actually...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of the Xiongren Emperor swearing and cursing sounded in the camp, and the nearby royal court officials lowered their heads one by one, trying to reduce their sense of existence as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the opportunity to avenge his shame, he flew away from under his nose. The bear emperor with a bad temper is now a cannon barrel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearman's violent temper is innate, and the racial nature cannot be changed by becoming a king. Not only the bear emperor has a bad temper, but all the emperors of the orc clan have bad tempers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times when I get angry, I don't save any sympathy. The advantage is that after venting your anger, the matter will pass quickly, which is much better than holding it in your heart to ferment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After venting for a while, the Xiong Renhuang who calmed down, frowned more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cursing can't solve any problems. After venting emotions, we still have to face reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big defeat on the front line led to the bankruptcy of the plan to destroy the Principality of Moxi, and it was meaningless to continue the original plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a cavalry unit, you can also consider whether to enter the Principality of Orton through the Principality of Mosi, and then stab the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Xiongren imperial court sent all infantry. If they followed suit, they would be surrounded by the human coalition forces before they could go out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary military engineering corps that originally destroyed the road has now gone back to rest and no longer digs holes along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that the enemy is not afraid of them passing by now, and may even be waiting for them to come. Without the support of allies, the little army sent by the bear emperor's court alone is not enough for the human race coalition army to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, let Bruno bring the team back!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang ordered rather helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cavalry\", the bear court needs a cavalry capable of fighting tough battles. The golem cavalry handed down from the ancestors is indeed very powerful, but the problem is that the number of golems is too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike war horses, which can be bred and produced in batches, golems are notoriously low in fertility. After becoming an adult, they give birth to one child every five or six years, and the young elephants have to be domesticated for more than ten years before they can go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the prestigious Golem Cavalry Legion was destroyed by the human race, the bear court has been thinking about reorganization all the time. It took a lot of hard work to catch a few magic elephants, and after decades of development, the elephant herd multiplied to more than 300 heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know how long I will have to wait to reproduce the grand occasion of Vientiane rushing together. The number of war elephants is insufficient, and the elephant cavalry has become an embellishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To truly play a role in a great war, at least hundreds of war elephants are needed to determine the success or failure of a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, this is impossible for the current bear court. Elephants still need to reproduce, and they cannot exhaust the water for fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more than 50 war elephants in the royal camp are definitely not enough to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is an extraordinary world, and there are so many things that can threaten war elephants. Whether it is a high-level knight, a magician, or a large magic crossbow or magic crystal cannon, they can all cause fatal blows to cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before a certain scale is formed, it is difficult for the golem cavalry to exert its power. There are many similar endangered arms among the various ethnic groups in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The golem cavalry was transferred here, in addition to acting as a front, it was more responsible for the camp security work, so as to avoid the tragedy of \"horse stepping on bear camp\" again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the retreat of the orc army, and excuses, Hudson, who had no more battles, suddenly became idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because of the stimulation of the war, the administrative speed of the bureaucrats of the Principality of Moxi was much faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military exploits and rewards that could have been disputed for several months, came up with a specific plan on the seventh day after the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accident. Apart from supplementing some of the ordnance and supplies consumed in the war, there are only a small amount of rewards for cultivation resources, and more rewards are \"war bonds\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real reason is much more complicated than Hudson expected in advance. Although the Principality of Moxi sold a lot of bonds, the gold coins it got were actually not many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After most of the gold coins were obtained, they were immediately traded and exchanged for strategic materials. Even if there are surplus funds in hand, the money is still abroad and has not been shipped back at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So much so that now the Principality of Moxi, the finances are only rich in name. Although the actual treasury will not let mice come in and cry, it is difficult to feed them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no cash in hand, and when rewarding heroes, they can only settle with bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still a special preferential treatment given to the expeditionary army as a guest army. If it is placed on the national army, it is directly recorded in the account first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that there are still smart people in the government of the Principality of Moxi, who know that bonds cannot be issued indiscriminately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have nothing to do, you can only visit and exchange feelings. Although he doesn't like these entertainments very much, in order to make more connections, Hudson still chooses to accept the reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, reinforcements from the Terran Alliance are coming soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he made a fuss, it's really too early. When did the Terran Alliance have such a high efficiency?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't be too surprised. The ones coming here ahead of time are only the masters sent by the major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all stimulated by the secret method of longevity. After the alliance meeting reached an agreement, all major forces sent experts over one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, the number of masters who came this time is much more than what was required by the Alliance Council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Holy See, it is said that hundreds of ascetic monks have come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the strong men whose lifespan was nearing the end of the continent gathered together. With so many strong men gathered, Bi Menghuang's good days will soon come to an end. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Prince George's explanation, Hudson understood it instantly. Whatever is beneficial or not, must give way in front of Changsheng.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those powerhouses whose lifespan is nearing, when encountering such a thing, they must try hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, to attract so many people to participate, it is definitely not enough to rely on only one longevity rumor, and there must be more evidence that has been circulated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson discovered that this seemed to be a big conspiracy, and someone was manipulating something behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, could it be that the rumors about the secret of longevity are true?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two people from different classes can become friends and sit here chatting purely because of their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Crown Prince George, he also has his own hardships. Under normal circumstances, it should be the crown prince's turn to preside over the overall situation when the king falls ill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the domestic nobles do not trust him, the young crown prince, including members of the royal family, and are unwilling to support him to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a big problem for the ministers of the DPRK and China to take power in the short term. But once this kind of thing continues, it is easy to have a pattern of \"the minister is strong and the monarch is weak\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delegating power is easy, but collecting power is difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current ministers are very peaceful and have enough respect for the royal family. It is hard to say what the future will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may not be possible to rebel, but the matter of the great nobles taking over the king has happened in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the future is not to be emptied, Prince George must establish prestige. In the current complicated situation, it is almost impossible to make a difference politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key to breaking the game lies in the military. The lessons learned by Crown Prince Caesar directly blocked the way for Prince George to command the army to make achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't break through from the front, then make a detour from the side. The risk of leading troops to the battlefield is too high, and everyone will not support it, so it's okay to follow the battle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who was invincible all the way, soon entered the sight of Prince George. Although Huyou Hudson failed to change jobs, it did not affect the two becoming friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with a group of old men, two people of similar age obviously have more topics in common.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whether the secret method of longevity is true, I am not sure. But Emperor Bimeng was able to live until now, and he did use the secret method of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This news has been confirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that in the current state of Emperor Bimeng, he can live another five hundred years. Eight hundred years of longevity can catch up with elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is used by the human race, if it is discounted in half, it is also a lifespan of 400 years, which can live longer than the strong in the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for those strong people, once they have such a long lifespan, the probability of further cultivation will increase greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is possible to break through the sanctuary, or even touch the realm above the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, according to the arcane masters, if you continue to practice and realize life leaps, your lifespan will continue to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the specific situation, there are not many records in the royal family's collection, and most of them are unofficial history, so it is impossible to judge whether it is true or false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only proof that can be found in history books is the group of ancient epic heroes. Many of them survived for more than three hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these myths and legends, many accidents occurred in the process of inheritance, and the content may be distorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially, the impact of the Ten Thousand Years Calamity is the most serious. After almost every catastrophe, the situation on the mainland will change drastically, and the civilizations of many races will suffer heavy losses. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince George replied, leaving Hudson wondering how to answer. The child's biggest hobby is to explore these strange things, and he lacks piety to the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was in the era when the Holy See ruled the mainland, a master like him who openly preached heresy would definitely be sent to the grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is the era of kingship, Caesar III dared to confiscate the property of the Holy See, Charles III was able to question the legitimacy of the Pope, and George preached the theory of arcane arts, which was nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remarks: Collateral and direct line are relative relationships, brothers and sisters belong to collateral blood relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that Alex is the crown prince, his lineage is the direct lineage, and other lines are collateral lines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Emperor Bimeng is the source, then the descendants of the other deceased crown princes are also direct heirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just when Hudson was concentrating on eating melons, an embarrassing thing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Moxi people were full of joy and prepared to welcome the alliance reinforcements, they all ran to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most embarrassing thing is that many teams passed by the principality, and the Mosi people mistakenly thought that they were sent by the alliance to reinforce them. The welcome banquet was all set up, but the old guys still left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was also one of the witnesses at the scene. The average age of the support troops passing by was 80+, and there were not a few of them over 100 years old. They were a group of \"uncle soldiers\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the strength is good, each of them will not survive for a few years. It is estimated that they are all unwilling to die of old age on the bed, and want to make a last effort while still able to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are still some loopholes in the rumors of the secret law of longevity, for a group of drowning people, the last straw must be grasped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who participated in this operation were not only the strong ones, some ordinary knights also mixed into the team. It is not only to fight before dying, but also to exert the last remaining heat for the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also death, and dying on the battlefield against the orcs is much more honorable than dying at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he have his posthumous name, but the enlistment mission that followed was also fulfilled incidentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, an orc empire is not worthy of the human race's full strength, only partial mobilization is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of reinforcements has increased greatly, and Hudson is naturally happy. No matter what purpose these people have, as long as they go to the battlefield, they will make substantial contributions to the cause of fighting the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson suddenly didn't want to have an accident with Emperor Beamon. As long as Emperor Bimeng is still alive, the dignitaries who peep into the secret law of longevity will not stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he returns to his lair, the army of the Human Race Alliance will chase him all the way. Maybe the stubborn disease of the orc empire would be eradicated in one fell swoop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the orcs as the enemy, although the land in the northern border is a little barren, it is no longer a hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only natural for the kingdom to take back the fallen land in the north. Even if it expands to more than a dozen provinces, it is not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is impossible to eat such a good thing alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either a large-scale land exchange operation, the territory of the Alpha Kingdom will move northward as a whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either a group of big forces within the Terran Alliance supported several new countries in the north and placed their own children there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of territory, the orc empire is not small. It is larger than the combined territory of more than a dozen countries of the northern human race, almost catching up to one-third of the entire human race territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although many of the land is difficult to develop and utilize, the remaining land is enough for everyone to share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the context of the bigger cake, Hudson, one of the main heroes, has a 99% probability of obtaining the earldom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more I thought about it, the more feasible it became. When it came time to implement it, Hudson found out embarrassingly that he couldn't do anything now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, Caesar III held a grand welcome banquet for the reinforcements from all over the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements from the major forces greatly exceeded the minimum number stipulated by the alliance meeting, and far exceeded Caesar III's expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected, it is enough to have hundreds of experts come to help. I never expected that \"a rumor\" would actually fool a huge team of more than 20,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All participants, the weakest are intermediate knights/magicians. There are more than 800 earth knights and magisters, and there are even 38 sky knights and 17 great magisters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, no one would have dared to believe that so many powerful people could be gathered at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also legendary figures, and many powerful people are already dead in the eyes of the outside world. If it weren't for the \"Secret of Longevity\" involved, it is estimated that these old antiques would not show up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, apart from a few long-lived races, there is no other force on the mainland that can produce so many masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is only part of the power of the human race. It can be said that the background of the overlord of the mainland is vividly reflected here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of them are old and weak, their combat effectiveness has to be discounted, which is also a force beyond ordinary people's imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the first cavalry or first infantry in the mainland, they are not worth mentioning in front of this \"grandfather regiment\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it is not enough to destroy the orc empire, but the strength to penetrate the Beamon imperial court is already available. With the small population of the Beamon clan alone, they can't stand the toss of these uncles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warmly entertaining all the \"uncles\", the smile on Caesar III's face never stopped. Suddenly his expression froze, and he said with a little embarrassment: \"Old ancestor, you are here too!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the secret method of longevity was released to fool the strong to come and deal with the orcs. Others are fine, his own family is not in the category of his fooling around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"So many old friends are here, can I not come out to greet you? That's fine, go do your own work, don't interfere with my old friend reunion.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III, who was good at observing words and expressions, instantly understood that this was a hint that he had something to talk to him after the banquet was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then you are always free, I will go to work first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Caesar III continued to shuttle through the crowd. There were hundreds of guests attending the banquet, representing hundreds of forces behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the visitors haven't had a good life for a few years, it doesn't mean that these old antiques have less voice in their own forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They retreated by themselves, but their descendants still hold power. Even if he is not the boss of the faction he belongs to, he is still an important person in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many people came to the banquet together, not because of the face of Caesar III, but because everyone needs a platform to communicate with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no future for those who should form groups and form alliances to fight alone in this kind of group battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Familiar with people everywhere, Caesar III had no choice but to. The unexpected arrival of reinforcements inevitably affected the Alpha Kingdom's strategic plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Caesar III was only thinking about defense. After seeing the luxurious lineup of reinforcements, he weighed it in his heart, and suddenly found that counterattack is actually more \"sweet\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the two sides cooperate well, they can definitely fight the orc army. Being able to drive the orcs back to their hometown in advance is such a big temptation, so naturally they can't miss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Busy until the end of the banquet, Caesar III dragged his exhausted body, before he had time to rest, he was dragged by his ancestors to a secret room in the palace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his own territory, he was so careful that Caesar III's expression became serious, and his intuition told him that something big would happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sit down, we are all kings, there is no need to stand all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calling you over today, I guess you have guessed a bit. Among the successive monarchs of my Alpha Kingdom, Ni boy is capable enough to rank among the top three.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout the entire continent of Aslante, there are very few monarchs who are more capable than you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But do you know that I just did something stupid. If it wasn't for good luck, someone would have almost caught me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man's words made Caesar III's face change drastically. Originally, seeing so many people being fooled over, he was secretly proud of the success of the plan, but he didn't expect to leave a loophole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old ancestor, please enlighten me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III hurriedly asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It stands to reason that he has been very secretive about releasing rumors. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible to find his head, but from what the old man said, it was obvious that he was wearing a bandage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political conspiracies and calculations don't matter, but it is another matter to calculate a group of old antiques who are dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give people hope, and then cut off their hope, it will drive people crazy. A group of dying people went crazy, and the destructive power that could erupt was absolutely beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You kid did it very covertly, there was no flaw in the first place, it's a pity that it's too coincidental!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Emperor Bimon arrived at the front line and broke through three lines of defense in a row, this rumor appeared on the mainland, and everyone had to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, you were lucky. Just after the rumors spread, similar rumors appeared within the Orc Empire, and some evidence was even found by major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You also know these things. It's just that under your preconceptions, you think that the secret of longevity does not exist at all, and you don't take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the fact is exactly the opposite. Judging from the information collected within the Orc Empire, Emperor Beamon was pulled back from the brink of death several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After each recovery, his body will return to the prime of life. Without these changes, he would have died a hundred years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indications that even if Emperor Bimon does not have the secret method of longevity in his hands, there is also a secret method that can prolong human life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this kind of secret method may have certain restrictions, or a certain price needs to be paid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, as long as the secret method exists. For those of us old guys who are dying, it's worth taking a gamble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the old man changed the face of Caesar III greatly. The \"secret method\" actually existed, which completely refreshed his cognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the continent of Aslante, there are many ways to prolong life, but they are all effective within the scope of normal lifespan. It is difficult for ordinary people to exceed one hundred and fifty years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As strong as a strong man in the sanctuary, he is only over two hundred years old. No matter how much heaven, material and earth treasures you take, you can't break through the limit of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, dark-type life-extending secrets don't count. Transforming into an undead, or becoming a lich, will greatly increase the lifespan, but it has changed the essence of life and become a new creature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old Ancestor, you mean this time...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man nodded, smiled lightly and said: \"Yes, I will also participate in this operation. Not only me, but the group of old antiques in the kingdom will not miss this opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the secret method of prolonging life in the hands of Emperor Beamon has very strict restrictions, and it is impossible to promote it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But, so what?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know my physical condition best. If they can't break through the bottleneck of the sanctuary, even if there are no accidents, it will only happen in the past one or two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Use the last of your life to fight for a chance, no matter what!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if this battle goes smoothly, it can also lift the kingdom's crisis. Even if he died on the battlefield, he still earned money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know what you want to say, but the current situation does not allow other options. If I don't participate in this operation, can others rest assured? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III was silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Secret of Longevity\" is involved. If the strong man of the Alpha Kingdom, who is a local snake, does not participate in the action, I am afraid everyone will not be able to help being suspicious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did he really not think of these things?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid, not necessarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a political strongman, what Caesar III is best at is to win the greatest victory at the least cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humans are not machines after all, they have their own feelings. Calculating others doesn't matter, when it comes to his own family, Caesar III still can't be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, since he released the rumor of the \"Secret of Longevity\", it means that the local strongmen of the Alpha Kingdom must participate in this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His life was not long, and he had to go to the battlefield to fight the orcs. Even if he could come back, he would be carried back lying down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biting cold wind howled and blew non-stop between the sky and the earth. Early in the morning, Caesar III stood at the gate of the city with a group of royal nobles to see off the reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the white-haired team full of vicissitudes, endless words will be together, and everything will be spoken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. For the elderly in their dying years, every day of the countdown to life is precious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it takes too long, some people in the team may fall on the road ahead of time before reaching the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a knight, even if he really wants to die, he must die on the battlefield. It would be too aggrieved if he died halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mighty reinforcements set off all the way north, and soon attracted the attention of Eagle scouts. It's just that this time they were very unlucky and encountered a strong team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he flew over the head of the army, he was dragged down by a violent knight, and he died miserably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just the beginning. The army marched all the way north, and the Yingmen who were in charge of scouting along the way were the first to fall victim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to detect intelligence, the key is how to send the information back. When encountering this unprovoked team, the Eagle scouts were taken down as soon as they showed up, purely giving away their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After reporting layer by layer, the news was quickly delivered to Emperor Bimon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What should come will eventually come!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is really my good son, his actions are extraordinary, and he immediately mobilized all the old and immortal people of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have been pretending for decades, why not keep pretending, why are you forcing me at this time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, it is still too tender after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought it was a bit more hidden.

Let all the troops prepare for battle, the counterattack of the human race is coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to summon the crown prince, tell him that I am unwell, and ask him to hand over the affairs in his hands, and then come over immediately to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the other four royal families that reinforcements from the human race have arrived, and let them seize the time to destroy the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of orders were issued, and Emperor Beamon, who had cut off his excess emotions, was left with only rationality, just like an emotionless machine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road to longevity is doomed to be lonely. From the grief when the eldest son died to the habit now, Bi Menghuang's heart has long been as firm as a rock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe occasionally emotional, but that's just a spice for a boring life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, immortality and powerful strength are the ultimate pursuit of Emperor Bimeng.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to achieve his goal, he can give everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the sound of shouting and killing, a group of special teams composed of \"gentlemen\" appeared on the battlefield of the two races of humans and beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic flying all over the sky opened the prelude to the great war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fire rain, hail, ground thorns, wind blades, thunder and lightning... That scene is better than countless special effects blockbusters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of magicians shot together, the scene was too shocking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A Ursine heavy infantry regiment at the forefront of the orc army, before they understood what happened, they met the beast **** amidst the dazzling fireworks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The bed crossbow shoots, the magic crystal cannon turns its muzzle. Sacrifice, quickly contain the enemy's magician group!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agustine's order was issued, and the priests behind him were stunned to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is their duty to restrain the enemy's magician group on the battlefield, but that also depends on the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the size that orcs are more suitable to take the warrior route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact is the same. The military strength of the Orc Empire crushed the three kingdoms of the Northern Human Race, but it was at a disadvantage when it came to the field of magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the priests are not strong enough, it's really a limitation of racial talent. Among the five royal families, there are countless people who are suitable for the warrior route, but there are very few who can practice magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't even need to practice much, you are a born warrior as an adult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of magical talent, orcs can only rely on the bestowal of the gods for their magical power. At the same time, the sacrificial group that shoulders the sacrifices to the gods and the output of magic has a special status among the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Beast God is an all-rounder, dabbling in all kinds of laws. If he is as specialized as the Lord of Dawn, the Orc Priest Group will be embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the power given by the gods, there is a limit after all, and it is also limited by the degree of faith piety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such a background, the strength of the orc priest group would naturally not grow. Being able to contain the magician group of the three northern countries is considered a super-level performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This group of uncle version of the magician group in front of them is a proper king in terms of spellcasting experience and their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magicians of the three northern countries can't make up such a lineup. How can a sacrificial group of them restrain them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War does not pay attention to the principle of fairness, and the battle that cannot be won is still fought. The orders have been issued, and it is time to try it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea is good, but the reality is very embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attack of the sacrificial group directly exposed their position. Seeing this scene, a group of magisters who were just watching the fun also became interested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meteor fire shower, earth pulse, tornado, falling ice and rocks...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to forbidden spells, it can be said that all advanced magic mastered by humans can be found here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic of the two groups collided fiercely in the sky, bursting out with dazzling light. However, the deadlocked battle didn't last for a few moments before a one-sided scene appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the magical attack that shrouded their heads, the orc priests hurriedly propped up their energy shields, but unfortunately, everything was futile in the face of absolute power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few sacrificial powerhouses, the reaction speed was fast enough to get out of the range of the magic strike in time, and the rest were wiped out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Agustin was also affected by Chiyu because he was too close to the sacrificial group. Although he was lucky enough to save his life, he was still disgraced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passed by death, Agustin's whole concept changed. All the annihilation of the human army has become a cloud at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that the group of perverts in front of him was not something his troops could handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guards, pass down the order to let the Pig Legion and Ratman Legion attack...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the word \"gong\" had time to come out, he swallowed it back forcefully. The enemy did not take advantage of the advantages of the mage group to continuously output attacks, but directly launched an army attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc formation, which had been torn to pieces a long time ago, was obviously unable to stop the charge of the enemy knights, Agustin hastily ordered: \"All the wolf cavalry regiments attack and stop the enemy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion Army and the Beamon Army attacked from both wings, disrupting the enemy's charge formation. The Bearman Legion immediately filled the gap and formed an formation against the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fastest wolf cavalry quickly appeared in front of the army from the flanks, blocking the way for the human knights to charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then a scene that Agustin will never forget appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Massacre, naked massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just one collision, the wolf cavalry regiment was killed and wounded, and countless wolf cavalry had no time to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The corpses all over the ground did not stop the \"Master\" knights from charging, and the Lion Legion and Beamon Legion that came from the two wings only delayed the time a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The formation of the knights was not torn apart, but in the fierce collision, the Lion Army and the Beamon Army were beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the cavalry with the ceiling of the mainland's combat power, when did it receive such insults?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, even the most elite knights of the human race were often suppressed and beaten by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this time is an exception. The weakest \"Master Knight\" rushing forward is also the Silver Knight. Even the most elite Beamon cavalry, they will take three or four away with one shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first cavalry in the mainland is not the same as the first knight in the mainland. The two are completely different concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity to realize that this is over. The Orc Cavalry Legion blocking the way suffered heavy losses in the collision. Before Agustin Mingjin retreated, he was defeated head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ursine infantry who were busy filling the vacancy and restoring their formation were also stunned by this scene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before they could recover, the knight spears had already stabbed them, and many bears were sent to see the beast gods while their heads were still buzzing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeat of the elite legion, not to mention the cannon fodder legion behind, with no room to struggle, was cut into two by the knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the commander of the Alpha Kingdom army in the rear hastily ordered the whole army to attack and beat the dog in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle is still going on, but this moment is no longer a confrontation between the two powers, but a unilateral massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agustine, who fled in a hurry, was still full of doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where did this group of perverts come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How could the human race have such a powerful army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What should the Orc Empire do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What should I do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With one question after another, Agustin gradually moved away from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The once famous orc commander was dead at this moment, and now he became a middle-aged Beamon full of fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Re-acquainted with the human race, Agustin finally understood why the human race is the overlord of the continent, while the orcs can only retreat to the border of the barren continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the notes of his ancestors, Agustin vaguely felt the unusualness of this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, although the human race was able to win, it was definitely not so easy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In most of the time, a few elite legions can rampage on the battlefield, beating the human army to flee in all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it failed, it was the result of being besieged by multiple human legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where is it like now, a group of old guys with all white beards who may die at any time beat them indiscriminately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Does this look like a fight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was clearly a premeditated massacre!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unimaginable that an army that emerged on a local battlefield has thousands of magician regiments and countless human masters accompanying the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not sure if it was an illusion, but there was a faint voice deep in his heart telling him that there were more masters in the enemy team than there were in the entire Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agustine's defeat was just the beginning. With the help of a group of \"uncle\" knights, the Alpha Kingdom continued to launch counterattacks in the border area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well-prepared the orc army was, or how many elite troops gathered, they couldn't stop the charge of the men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Eagle troops who came and went without a trace paid a heavy price on the battlefield. Once caught by the uncles, the eagle falling incident will happen in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to retaliate, the Orc Empire also dispatched two eagle legions at one time to cooperate with the army on land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the final result was not much better. The enemy's magicians turned into artillery and bombarded them, and a group of old immortals flew directly into their ranks to start a massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the orcs on land can fight against the enemy, but their air force cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the weapons equipped are aimed at ground troops, and bows and arrows are usually used to face air threats. Once approached by the enemy, the fighting power is not much stronger than that of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, there were frequent good news from the front line. It is said that Caesar III's mouth was almost crooked, and Hudson, who was thousands of miles away, felt this joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the battle reports forwarded by the Kingdom, the Alpha Kingdom has gradually regained the previously lost lines of defense, and almost expelled all the orcs from the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting in the same trench, victory always resonates with everyone. Watching the allies advance triumphantly on the battlefield, the city of Dapace is also filled with the joy of victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by a dispute in the court of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victories in the past few days have made the high-level officials of the kingdom optimistic about the situation of the war. Some military generals proposed to recover the land lost by the kingdom in the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this strategic plan is completed, the troops that penetrated into the Principality of Moxie and the Warhammer Kingdom will be separated from the mainland of the Orc Empire and become a lone army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without reinforcements from the orcs, the strategic situation was completely reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs who are isolated and helpless die one less, even without the reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance, they can slowly grind them to death on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is this war stable, but the future defense security of the Principality of Moxi will also be greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the Alpha Kingdom as their meat shields, they can once again live a wonderful life of eating melons and watching movies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, when a war breaks out in the future, pay attention to provide more support to \"old friends\" to avoid repeating this tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson just smiled lightly at what the Mosi people thought. Ideals are always needed, otherwise how would we know the cruelty of the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on his understanding of Caesar III, it is absolutely impossible to regain the lost ground in the last war at this time. Even putting aside all the advantages and disadvantages, the Alpha Kingdom does not have the strength to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the front line is advancing triumphantly, but except for the orcs who accidentally suffered a big loss in the initial battle, they only suffered more losses in the later battles, and the actual loss of the main force was not great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the beheadings in the battle report were done with miscellaneous soldiers. Anyway, Hudson seldom saw specific introductions to beheading orcs in official documents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, as long as more than 300 orc royal elites have been killed, they will be listed and introduced separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no mention in the domestic newsletter, Hudson defaulted to it. Since the main force of the enemy still exists, the large-scale recovery of lost ground is a military adventure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recovering lost ground is not just about \"recovering\", but more importantly, \"recovering\". After you get it back, you have to send troops to garrison it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Been plagued by orcs for so many years, the original fortifications have long been turned into ruins. If you want to build a defense line, you can only start from scratch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wounds caused by the war have not been repaired in time. How could the Alpha Kingdom have such a strong national power, so it ran to manage the northern land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the short term, the Alpha Kingdom will not be able to obtain any real benefits except for gaining some reputation by recklessly marching north to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even because of the reversal of the war situation, the reinforcements of the Human Race Alliance who were already on the way would disband on the spot and go home directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it. On the surface, Hudson is a firm main fighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention regaining the lost ground, even if someone proposed: send troops to the north, and go all the way to the nest of the orc royal court. As long as he is not asked to lead troops to complete, Hudson will also express his support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a human design, it's all political needs. It just represents the position of his current identity, not his own position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the foreign secretary in front of him who was lobbying for him, Hudson wanted to laugh. Don't look at his majesty in the Principality of Moxi, it's all pretending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he really came to China, who would know him among the high-level officials in the Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He made great achievements in battle, but unfortunately he fought in the Principality of Moxi. Nominally, all kingdoms are treated equally, but in practice, there are still differences when it comes to specific operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core reason is that the distance is too far. With only the data on paper, it is difficult for everyone to feel Hudson's contribution to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone can recognize these contributions, it does not mean that Hudson's voice in politics will be as high as it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In essence, the right to speak comes from strength. In the Principality of Moxi, he has an expeditionary force of 110,000, and his military strength is almost equivalent to a quarter of the Principality of Moxi's current strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the development of the frontline battle situation, the proportion of the strength of the expeditionary force is still rising. If all Terence's lines of defense fell, this ratio could even increase to forty percent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength at hand and the support of the Alpha Kingdom behind him, Hudson can naturally be tough in speaking and doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was different when returning to the country. The expeditionary force was disbanded and went back to each family. He, the commander-in-chief, was beaten back to his original form in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone is united to form a new political faction, it will be difficult to gain too much political say in the short term.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, Hudson is strong now, because the platform provided by the Alpha Kingdom is strong, and it is essentially the power of the platform, not his own power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aside from the power of the platform, his lineage has expanded to just over ten thousand troops. Some powerful middle-level nobles in the country have stronger overall strength than what he has in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply a dream to expect him to promote the decision-making of the kingdom. If he really had that political influence, Hudson would not use it at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, regaining the lost land is the common wish of every nobleman in the Alpha Kingdom. In principle, I definitely support this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I'm not in the country now, and I'm really beyond my control over the decision-making of the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to wait a little while until the expeditionary force returns home to rest, I will definitely propose to His Majesty the King and do my best to promote the implementation of this strategic plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's casual answer made Renato break out in a cold sweat. The expeditionary force is going back to China, what kind of joke is this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reversal of the situation in the Alpha Kingdom does not mean that the situation in the Principality of Moxi has also been pulled back. Terence's line of defense is crumbling. Once the line of defense collapses, the orc army will go south again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the important military force of the Expeditionary Army, there is no way to guarantee the arrival of reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance based on their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the real problem of survival, everything has to be compromised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's face is too deceptive. It is entirely possible for a young and high-spirited general to return home with an expeditionary force to regain lost ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this matter still needs to be discussed in the long term. We are only a proposal, mainly because the opportunity suddenly appeared, and it would be a pity not to take advantage of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is changing rapidly, and no one can tell what will happen in the future. It is suitable to make a move now, but it does not mean that it will be suitable in the future. Even if you rush back now, it may be too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all for the purpose of attacking the orcs. Why don't you stay here first and smash the enemy's ambition to go south and subvert our hegemony on the human continent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato reorganized the language and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he was already depressed to death. He had already heard from his colleagues that Hudson was a bit difficult to deal with, but he never expected that he would be so difficult to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just made a suggestion, not only was Hudson blocked the topic, but he was even turned against the general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he is just young and energetic, but his years of diplomatic career tell him that this is a kind of cryptic warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Apart from greeting the bureaucrats who built the city wall, Marshal Hodge can do nothing now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some hard work, I finally got in touch with the outside world. The situation in the principality improved slightly, but reinforcements still couldn't come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many troops gathered near Dapace, most of them are recruits recruited temporarily. It is obviously a bit embarrassing to fight head-on with the orc army in the wild.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The absolute strength gap cannot be made up by hard work alone. The Principality of Moxi cannot afford the consequences of military adventures now, and the bureaucrats in the capital will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements couldn't come, so the bureaucrats in the capital still did a personnel matter, allowing them to break through after the city was broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there are children of the major nobles in the capital city. If it is determined that they cannot keep it, there is no need for the \"own family\" to stay and be buried with the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when this order came, it didn't have much substantive meaning. Breaking through is simple to say, but it is not feasible to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stick to the city, the defenders can still fight the orcs. If it leaves the protection of the city wall, it will be another picture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A person with two legs can't run on four legs, so if he breaks out now, he is giving the enemy a head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some of the reinforcements sent by the orcs went south to the Warhammer Kingdom, and some were on their way back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can escape from the orc encirclement, there is a high probability that they will run into these people on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mass evacuations do not exist. The only way is to break through separately and gamble on luck, which is doomed to sacrifice most of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, let's leave together! The chaotic situation in the country cannot be separated from you now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Harley tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all true, he really hopes that Marshal Hodge can break through. The situation in the Principality of Moxi seems to have improved, but with the fall of the Terence line of defense, it will soon take a sharp turn for the worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the king has gathered a lot of troops and is ready to fight the orcs, but the principality still lacks a commander with high prestige and rich experience in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the only remaining Marshal in the Moxi Army, if Marshal Hodge can break out of the siege, he may indeed become the commander-in-chief of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Harley, go by yourself! The Terrance defense line has fallen, and someone has to stay and be buried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I stay and die with the city, not only to give an explanation to the people of the country, but also to the countless dead defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to news from the country, reinforcements will arrive in another month and a half. Given the current situation in the principality, as long as you don't mess around, it's not difficult to delay for such a little time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the commander-in-chief, isn't the Earl of Hudson, who has never been defeated since his debut, a ready-made candidate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strong ability, great military exploits, and reputation have been blown up by them. They will leave after the war, and will not crowd out everyone's core interests. They are much more popular than a bad old man like me! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge laughed and cursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to live and die with the city, in addition to these obvious reasons, there is also his body, which has reached the verge of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long-term high-pressure environment has brought him too much burden. The body is honest, when you are tired and tired, you need to rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge, who was physically and mentally exhausted, really didn't want to continue this high-pressure life. Death has become a kind of relief for him now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom, boom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a loud noise, the overwhelmed city wall finally collapsed. Numerous orc armies swarmed in from the gap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the officers rushed forward with the defenders, trying to close the gap again, but unfortunately the gap was too big this time, and despite the defenders' best efforts, they still couldn't block the orc soldiers. front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city is broken!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic officers guarding the city are still fighting hard with the defenders. Every building in the city is their position. This is the last stubbornness of the guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn orc bastards!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Moxie son of a bitch, I remember you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ever since receiving the news that the orc army was going south and was about to arrive in the Kingdom of Warhammer, Joseph II's scolding has never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's really deceitful. The last time Dapac was besieged, the orc army used a detour to intersperse, and they couldn't stop it, so it made sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time the situation is obviously different. The siege of Dapes has been lifted, hundreds of thousands of troops gathered together, and the orc cavalry slipped past under their noses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The traces of water release are too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't stop the orc cavalry, you still have to fight a battle to prove that you did your best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the Mosi people seemed to be procrastinating. When they received the news that the orc army was passing by, they did not immediately send cavalry to intercept them, but gathered the army to act together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of being cautious: when the army slowly arrived on the battlefield, the orc cavalry had already entered the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life was hard at first, but now there are tens of thousands more orc cavalry, making the situation in Warhammer Kingdom even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of cause, what kind of fruit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous Warhammer Kingdom promised to send troops to support, but it was only for show, and now it is time to pay back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the enemy's reinforcements have arrived, and our attempts to encircle and annihilate this remaining orc army may be difficult to achieve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, we will shrink the front line and retreat to the west of the kingdom for the time being. We will wait for the alliance reinforcements to arrive before launching a counterattack. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Military Affairs Thiago spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real situation of Warhammer Kingdom is more serious than what he said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent the orcs from taking advantage, they chose to encircle and wipe out the orc infantry in the encirclement first, and then went to find the enemy's cavalry for a decisive battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decision must be correct. Even if you want to go to the enemy's cavalry, the infantry can't catch up with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cavalry has hope to catch up with the enemy, but the problem is that they can't beat the enemy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standing army is all dragged on the front line. The three and a half cavalry regiments + five knight regiments cobbled together from all over the country, how can they have the confidence to find more orc cavalry for a decisive battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that are destined to be impossible, naturally have to be put back. Even if they knew that the actions of the orc cavalry were destroying the foundation of the Warhammer Kingdom, they could do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sacrifice cannot be wasted, and if the enemy cannot stop the destruction, then destroy the orc infantry in front of you first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan was very full, and it was only after fighting that I realized the skinny feeling of reality. The camp chosen by the orc infantry is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and the terrain limits the troops involved in the attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on an army of 700,000, it is difficult to take advantage of the large number of troops. Has been tossing until now, but still failed to take down the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remnants of the orcs in Tiago's mouth, in fact, there are more than 20,000 people. Compared with the original strength, it is only a loss of 6,000 to 7,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, Warhammer Kingdom suffered tens of thousands of casualties, making it a big loser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen the hope of victory, Thiago would not have suggested retreating to the west of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is everyone's foundation, which has been almost destroyed by the orcs, and the rest can't be kept. Substantial damage has been done, and it's time to accept reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Joseph II said indifferently: \"If you want to leave at this time, can the orc agree?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when the alliance's reinforcements will arrive, but the orc reinforcements have already arrived anyway. We withdraw now, and the kingdom's army at the front is finished! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't cry when he sees the coffin, it's really the current situation, even if the army wants to make a strategic move, it is difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of thousands of troops have been transferred, and the length of the marching team is self-evident. The one-word long dragon formation was exposed to the enemy's soldiers, and it was scary to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to successfully complete the strategic transfer, you will definitely lose a lot of troops. Even if it is more than half of the loss, it is not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that the main force of the kingdom who is firmly on the front line will also become a lone army, facing the enemy's front and back attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you're lucky, you can hold out until the Human Race Alliance reinforcements arrive, then that's all. But if the battle is defeated in advance, the loss of the Warhammer Kingdom will be really huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, maybe they can challenge the title of the weakest kingdom on the mainland. Duchies with a little strength are stronger than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lowered international status is barely tolerable. The domestic political balance will also be broken, and the eastern aristocrats will decline collectively. The western aristocrats who were originally at a disadvantage will inevitably come out to fight for dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strength determines the right to speak. With the loss of the foundation of the royal family, Joseph II's control over the kingdom will inevitably decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The solution is not without, but the consequences are very serious. For example: let the western nobles in the army come to the rear to block the enemy's pursuit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be used to kill people with a knife, and the nobles in the western mountainous area are afraid that they will be even more alienated from the kingdom. Even if the strategic transfer is completed, it is difficult to obtain the full support of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe those guys might just abandon him as the king, go straight for independence after the war, and form a new country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things have happened many times in history. The current northern clans and nations were independent from the Guangming Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many ready-made learning templates, Joseph II didn't think that the western nobles couldn't follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the strength of the Warhammer Kingdom was greatly damaged after the war, and the entire Warhammer Plain was reduced to ruins. The problem of post-war reconstruction was difficult to solve, and it was simply impossible to send troops to suppress the rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the current situation can no longer be taken care of so much. The army's logistics has been interrupted by the enemy, and the food and grass carried with the army is very limited, which cannot support long-term operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's reinforcements have already arrived. If the delay continues, it will become more difficult for the army to move. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Guy said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stop loss in time, this is the necessary survival ability of every excellent nobleman. Before that, everyone wanted to organize a decisive battle between the army and the orcs. The family foundation was still there, and we had to work hard to protect it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are all empty, and there is no point in continuing to hold on. Naturally, we must consider the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interests of the kingdom are put aside first, and it is better to preserve its strength as much as possible at the moment, so as to avoid being eliminated in the future political turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest Palace, Hudson was invited to discuss matters early in the morning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the fall of Terence City has spread, and now there is only one Flying Bear Castle remaining on the entire Terence defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information received, it seems that the situation in Flying Bear Castle is also very bad. The outer city and its affiliated fortresses have all fallen, and only the inner city is still in the hands of the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long it can last, no one can tell. Maybe it's fallen now, but the news hasn't been delivered yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, it is a miracle that Terence City can survive until now. According to Hudson's judgment, Terrance City should have been lost half a month ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. In order to understand the siege of Dapes, the Mosi people mobilized troops from the front line, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secondly, there are small defects in many places in the city defense fortifications, and the quality of the project can only be said to be barely passable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With multiple unfavorable factors superimposed, Hudson is naturally not optimistic. Being able to persist until yesterday, the performance of the defenders is definitely considered excellent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the faces of everyone that everyone is not in a good mood. Many people's eyes are slightly red and swollen, obviously crying a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that there are juniors on the front line, and now the defense line has completely collapsed, and the human tragedy of a white-haired man giving a blond-haired man has been staged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to do it. When the country is in trouble, these \"major shareholders\" must also fulfill their obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the last to enter the venue, Hudson didn't panic at all. He got up as soon as he was notified, and he didn't mean to be late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the desolate atmosphere of the room, Hudson's mood also fell. Under the guidance of the attendant, he sat in his seat without saying a word, and was sad with everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being silent for a while, Prime Minister Herceg suppressed his grief and said: \"Everyone is here, so let's start the meeting!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terence line of defense has collapsed. Given the current situation in the principality, it is already difficult to build a new line of defense to stop the invasion of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing unexpected happens, the orc army has already begun to move south. It won't be long before there will be a second Dapez defense battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements of the Terran Alliance are still on the way. Even if we let them speed up now, we have to hold out for at least 40 days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Defense plan, how to make it, let's talk about it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to recover so quickly, Hudson's evaluation of Prime Minister Herceg was instantly higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eldest son died on the battlefield, and the second son was trapped in the Flying Bear's Fort, and his life and death are unknown. There are not many people who can keep calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that Prime Minister Herceg has only two sons, at least on the surface. If they all died on the battlefield, the results of his hard work would have to be handed over to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When most people encounter this situation, there is a high probability that they will directly turn on the bad mode. This is a model aristocrat who can come to preside over the meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Before the defense plan is formulated, we have to elect a commander to command the entire army. Otherwise, every military transfer will be decided by our group, and there will be a big mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I propose that the Earl of Hudson be the commander-in-chief of this war and be responsible for commanding the armies of the two countries. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins' words surprised Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that there is a lack of prestigious commanders in the Moxi Army, but it does not mean that they have no candidates. As the Minister of Military Affairs, Earl Martins himself is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was in charge of the previous defense of Dapez. The military quality shown is quite outstanding among the senior officials of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now coming out to recommend Hudson not only means that Earl Martins himself gave up, but more importantly, the transfer of command of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting at home and handing over the command of one's own army to outsiders is not only courageous, but courageous beyond imagination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell to the ground, everyone began to discuss in low voices. Hudson estimated that if he hadn't been there, someone might have jumped out and scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not come out to object immediately. Apart from having a high enough emotional intelligence, the more important thing is that now Earl Martins has expressed his position. He is not interested in the position of commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is also rejected, they have to find a new coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing topic. There are many generals in the army of the Principality of Moxi, but there are very few famous generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Earl Fidelis had some prestige in the army, but it is a pity that he had previously led the troops of the southern provinces, and was ravaged by the Beamon Army halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they did not suffer a major defeat, hundreds of thousands of troops were overwhelmed by the enemy's army. Such a record is obviously not convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own family can't even recognize it, let alone the expeditionary force. If the expeditionary force doesn't buy it, there will definitely be problems with the cooperation of the two armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from Hudson, who can move in strategically if he can't win, the senior leaders of the Principality of Moxi don't have the courage to abandon Dapes and embark on the road of exile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins pushed Hudson to the top position, obviously fully considering this point, and didn't want to make trouble in the subsequent cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the command of the army is temporarily relinquished, the army is still the army of the Principality of Moxi. It's nothing more than losing face, and the actual interests will not be damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I support the proposal of the Minister of Military Affairs. The Earl of Hudson has made great achievements in military affairs. He has experienced hundreds of battles since the beginning of the army and has never been defeated. He is the best candidate for the commander!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Renato's words were like pouring a basin of water into boiling oil, and the room became lively in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's interesting is that everyone's discussion is discussion, but they only express their opinions in private, and no one publicly stands up to express their opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others do not object, but Hudson wants to object. Although the position of the commander of the coalition forces is good, the responsibility is also very heavy. In case of defeat, there is no chance to shirk responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that there is only responsibility, but no substantial benefits can be seen. It is right to win, but you have to lose the popularity you have worked so hard to accumulate if you lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was about to speak up to object, but Prime Minister Herceg took the lead and said: \"Since everyone does not object, the commander-in-chief of the army will be Earl Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency Earl, for the safety of the human race, please accept this important task! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The righteousness of the human race came out, and the people who were still talking about it suddenly became quiet and looked at Hudson quietly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly they realized that it seemed that discussing this topic was still their own wishful thinking, and they had not yet obtained the consent of the person concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of being rejected, what should I do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The change in mentality directly affected everyone's attitude. One by one is not thinking about how to oppose Hudson's rise, but how to push him up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

However, Lu Ziye, a native of Moxi, spent a lot of money to activate the magic circle of communication, and invited Caesar III to be a lobbyist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the earnest persuasion of his boss, Hudson was still unable to withstand the pressure after all, and reluctantly took over this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To drive ducks to the shelves, I have to admit that the Moxi people are really big-hearted, and they are not afraid of him being passive and sabotaging work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the current Hudson really dare not make small moves. For no other reason, his path to great aristocracy was cut off after a big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was because of this that Moxi tried his best to push him to the top position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability is strong enough to not crowd out everyone's interests, and the future is bound, so there is only one commander who must work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being the commander of the coalition forces is extremely risky, and although the benefits are seriously insufficient, they are not completely absent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: title of honor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After winning this battle, at worst, he could win the title of Marshal awarded by the Principality of Moxi. If he wins beautifully, maybe his own kingdom will also grant one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, the Marshal is full of gold. If you don't have battle experience and outstanding military exploits, you won't be awarded at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in this kind of resistance to alien invasion, the title of marshal obtained can be enjoyed in the whole continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost approaching the career ceiling of a soldier, and above that is the title of marshal awarded by the Human Race Alliance, which can directly enjoy the marshal treatment in all race countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the marshals awarded by the Terran Alliance have high gold content, they are all big figures in the history books. Everyone has made a major contribution in the development of the human race, and none of them are alive now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How difficult it is, one can imagine. Anyway, just defeating the orc invasion is not enough, at least you have to lead the human army to kill the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or participate in a few more battles against alien invasions, accumulate enough outstanding achievements, and have enough popularity to be approved by the Alliance Parliament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are things Hudson can't even imagine. Being able to win the title of marshal of a principality is enough for him to pretend to be a force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is lucky enough to obtain the title of marshal of his own kingdom, then he will become an important military general of the Alpha Kingdom, or one of the spokespersons of the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, everyone would selectively ignore the problem of his original background, and readily accept him into the circle of great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike now, even if Hudson gets the ticket to become a great nobleman, whether he can cross the threshold is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blessing and misfortune!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While enjoying the dividends brought by the title of \"Marshal\", it is natural to bear the corresponding backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Acceptance” also means to value. Once there is a conflict of interest, or even a potential conflict of interest, everyone will regard him as an opponent of the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to continue to \"dog\". Once the war is over, suppression is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a challenge that all classes must go through. The difference is limited to slightly more positions below, and the competition is not so fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to complain, at least the Alpha Kingdom still has the possibility of crossing classes. Those countries in the hinterland of the human race, where fighting wars is like playing house, do not even have the opportunity for class transition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are played according to the rules of the game, and the competition is hard power. Even if you have all kinds of calculations and all kinds of hills and valleys, there is no use for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dividing up the cake at home, you can only go out to find opportunities. After the orc invasion, many knights from inland countries came to join the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on Hudson's name, the expeditionary force also recruited many noble children from foreign countries. It's a pity that their abilities in all aspects are very average. Most of their military accomplishments are limited to commanding a team of ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great talent, maybe there is! It's a pity that Hudson's reputation is obviously not enough, and he is not qualified to attract talented people to join him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson is more willing to believe that talents are cultivated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of systematic knowledge inheritance, no matter how strong the talent is, it can be raised and abandoned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his position, seek his own government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war is not easy to fight. After taking the position of commander-in-chief of the coalition forces, Hudson immediately began to make big moves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army is on the way, even if the Mosi people destroy the road again, the delay will not be long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must be too late for troop training. The only thing that can be done is to temporarily integrate the command system to boost the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific strategic deployment, that is, one word \"stable\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the 480,000 troops of the Principality of Moxi and the 110,000 expeditionary force, the total strength is approaching 600,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commanding so many troops to fight is really embarrassing Hudson. Even after experiencing the experience on the battlefield, he still has no bottom in his heart because of such a large span all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there are many soldiers and generals, but in fact there are only a few hundred thousand who can be regarded as elite. Among the remaining troops, it is estimated that there are only about 200,000 people who have received military training and been on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the other troops are not mentioned, Hudson, who has inspected the barracks, can only be described in one word, that is \"difficult to describe.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either serfs who just put down their hoes, or freedmen who don't know where to recruit into the army. There is a high probability that there is a shortage of people, and in order to make up the number, measures are taken as a last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the registered population of the Principality of Moxi is only over 8 million people, and even if there are some hidden and concealed populations, it will be more than 10 million people at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has progressed to the present, and if there are not one million soldiers lost by the Moxi people, there are still seven to eight hundred thousand soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of young and strong losses will definitely seriously affect the conscription work. In order to complete the task, it is not a strange thing to recruit strong men to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are forcibly conscripted, and they haven't had time to conduct comprehensive military training, and they can't expect anything from the morale and combat effectiveness of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the enemy is an orc, not a human civil war. Otherwise, when this kind of troops arrives on the battlefield, they will be able to start the bad mode immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the actual situation of the army, Hudson decisively decided that the future combat strategy of the infantry corps would be - \"Strengthen the stronghold and fight dull battles\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect a big victory, as long as you don't encounter a big defeat. The problem of finding fighters is left to the cavalry corps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is purely forced by reality, and cannot solve the enemy's air force. Most of the tactics are difficult to play their due role on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Waste, they are all a bunch of waste! Simply luring the enemy to go deep can turn into a big rout, you are simply...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Behemoth's furious curses did not at all resemble the physical condition that a 300-year-old man should have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The incident of the secret law of longevity that has caused a lot of noise not only caused an uproar in human society, but even in the orc empire, many old immortals who were dying of their lifespan were staring at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that he was intimidated by Emperor Bimon for a long time, I am afraid that some people would come to ask for it directly. Being able to hold back now does not mean being able to hold back forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A strong man who has reached the end of his lifespan, once he becomes crazy, he can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this unfavorable situation, Emperor Bimon was secretly worried. The secret method has reached the last step, and the number of sacrifices required far exceeds his previous estimate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are very few strong casual cultivators, and most of them are in major forces. It is not so easy to find a single strong person to fight against Sap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no other choice, he could only cast his eyes on the battlefield. This is the only place where you can kill people in large numbers without arousing suspicion from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to lure more masters to come, when the news of the secret technique came out, Emperor Bimon simply pushed the boat along and let the message spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan did not change quickly. The masters were lured over, but the quantity was \"billion points\" more than expected, and the quality also exceeded expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the old and strong men are not as fit as their peak, their combat effectiveness is greatly reduced, but these people also have their own advantages, such as: rich combat experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: Crazy enough. Whoever dares to stop them from pursuing the path of immortality is their endless enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the strength gap reaches a certain level, various strategies and tactics become unreliable. Obviously they just wanted to lure the enemy to go deeper, but in the end it really turned into a big rout, and it became a common thing on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fish did not lead to the intended location, and the bait was eaten by the enemy first. No wonder Emperor Beamon couldn't suppress his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to face the enemy head-on, but this is destined to be an unequal exchange. Most of the people who come out of the human race are guys whose longevity has come to an end, even if the group is wiped out, it will not have a great impact on the strength of the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, even if these people don't die on the battlefield, they will die one after another in recent years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrate the power of the entire orc empire, and exchange lives with a group of guys who are destined to die in recent years. Even if Emperor Bimon is willing, the other four royal families will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, they were originally scattered. What Emperor Bimon can mobilize now is only the nearby troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nominal number of troops is several million, but anyone with a little military strength knows that it is impossible for so many troops to gather in a large camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is not a fool, so he just watched him mobilize his troops in a daze. If you want to make large-scale military adjustments on the front line, you will have to pay a very painful price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the army was assembled, it was estimated that it would be disrupted in sevens and eighties. In a purely military confrontation, there is really little hope of victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to teach the enemy a lesson, Emperor Beamon also took out the means of suppressing the bottom of the box, preparing to use extraordinary means to reverse the current strategic passivity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the enemy is also a group of old foxes. After defeating the bait of the three main army groups that were thrown out, they turned around and went straight to a nearby orc army. They didn't go according to his plan at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cursing can't solve any problems. They have suffered defeats all the way in the past few days, and the morale of the army has already dropped to the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rao is that Emperor Bimon wanted to hold accountable for the defeat, and he didn't know who to start with. All the generals suffer defeat together, then defeat is due, and victory is an alternative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the enemy's strength is too strong. We have too few strong soldiers accompanying the army. Almost as soon as we show up, we will be besieged by the enemy, which will do too much damage to the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially during the war, as long as the officers come out to command the battle, it is difficult to escape the enemy's clutches...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abraham bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the defeated generals, he has suffered several defeats. The more you lose, the more you get used to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Abraham fiercely, Emperor Beamon temporarily suppressed the anger in his chest. The reasons are all real. The orc army keeps failing miserably. The biggest reason is that the number of strong men is too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, a frontal collision will be defeated by the enemy. The most direct reason is that the frontline officers who commanded the battle were killed in large numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to take the lead, you must be prepared to be killed, so that after all previous defeats, the death rate of officers has remained high, especially middle and high-level generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rout is gathered, it is really a rout. For the first time, there was a \"lack of officials\" in the following troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officer position that was originally \"scrambled by beasts and beasts\" has now become a hot potato. Hearing the word \"promotion\" can make many orcs sweat coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't want to listen to your explanations. Aren't they all very capable in the past? They clamored to destroy the human race every day, and wanted my orc empire to return to the era of subversion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that your wish has been fulfilled, the war broke out, why not implement it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell you, the enemy has gone ruthless this time. They don't care which race or tribe you are, as long as you show signs of decadence, the enemy will fight all the way into the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like destroying many vanished alien races, we will be wiped out from the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are survivors, they are just lingering. Under the rule of the human race, he was worried and trembling all day long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't want that scene to happen, so I used all my skills. Let the enemy know that we orcs are not easy to mess with, and dispel their unrealistic illusions! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Behemoth reprimanded sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously the hatred he drew out by himself, it completely changed in his mouth, and became a problem for all orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cause is not important, the key is the result. They have already made a move, and with the hatred of the two races of humans and beasts, if there is a chance to destroy the orc empire, it will definitely not be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others don't know about the \"Secret Law of Longevity\", but Emperor Bimon knows it very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This thing, it is absolutely impossible to hand it over. Once it is taken out, his descendants will rebel first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, this kind of evil secret technique looks like a thing with extremely strong side effects. Even if it is handed over, people will not believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that people will think that this is a conspiracy he planned to provoke internal fighting among the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the secret method too difficult?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to try, not only do you need a large number of masters as sacrifices, but you also need to kill a son to bear the backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entry requirements have killed countless people. Even if they have the ability to complete it, how many people are willing to foolishly kill a son for an experiment for a secret method whose authenticity cannot be determined?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most pitiful thing is that it is not enough for one son to sacrifice himself, and there must be enough sons, otherwise he cannot afford so many backlashes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Aslant continent, there are very few who can meet all the conditions. The secret method that is destined to be unable to be used will definitely not satisfy everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if you want to lure the enemy into taking the bait, according to the previous practice, I'm afraid it won't work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless extraordinary means are used, let them have a reason to come. Otherwise, it will be difficult to lure them over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abraham's proposal made Emperor Bimon's face change. \"The reason why I have to come\" is clearly to let him use himself as bait to catch the masters of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wanted to refuse at first, but when the words came to his lips, Emperor Bimon swallowed them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the loss of the orc army has not been a little bit. The number of soldiers killed in battle even exceeded the sum of the previous months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the elite legions of the five royal families were overthrown by the enemy. The troops that did not confront the enemy head-on were also trembling with fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, I don't know if it can lead the human masters into the trap. Anyway, the frontline orc army is going to be really cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the officers and soldiers under his command to have no resentment after successive defeats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they didn't say anything on their lips, deep down in their hearts, they probably greeted the whole family of Emperor Bimon a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be suppressed in a short period of time, but if it accumulates over time, it will eventually explode one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, this time I will be in charge of the Chinese army!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

However, after the defense of Dadil City ended, there were only two isolated cities left on the Terence line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The line of defense has become wired but undefended, naturally losing its original strategic value. An isolated city without sufficient strategic value is not worth betting on the country's luck to rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Appropriate abandonment, to avoid being strategically passive again, is totally worthwhile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things also appeared in Warhammer Kingdom. The destination of the strategic transfer of the army is the western mountainous area, which is easy to defend, instead of running to the front line to reinforce the steel defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost the same as the choice of the Mosi people, the difference is that the Moxi Principality does not have enough strategic depth, so it can only stick to the king's capital and fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone made the most rational choice, but this time the Principality of Moxi accidentally cheated the Kingdom of Warhammer again. Although unintentional, Joseph II found it difficult to accept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After pulling out the nail, there are two choices before the orc army: continue to go south to the Principality of Moxi; or go west to the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The choice of the Orc Empire is to have all of them. Go all the way south to continue to invade the Principality of Moxi, and go all the way west to strengthen the troops attacking the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line suddenly increased by more than 300,000 enemy troops. It is impossible to feel comfortable on anyone's body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the current bad situation, they were all cheated by their allies, and Joseph II was full of anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the waste of the Mosi people, allowing the orc army to detour to their rear to launch an attack, the situation in the Warhammer Kingdom would never have deteriorated so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, he became jealous of the Alpha Kingdom. It was originally agreed that as \"bad brothers and bad brothers\", everyone would be beaten together, but in the end, someone ran away first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the number of soldiers killed in battle, the Alpha Kingdom is no less than the other two countries, but it has always blocked the orc army in the North, and the damage is mainly in the northern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rear has basically not suffered heavy damage. No matter how big the loss on the front line is, it will be able to recover in a few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike them and the Moxi Principality, the two unlucky guys, not only did the soldiers suffer heavy casualties, but the civilians suffered even more. Since the war has progressed to the present, both countries have lost millions of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, if the population of the two countries can remain half after the war, it will be blessed by the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is a luxury.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current gameplay of the orc army, the Warhammer Great Plains would have been reduced to white ground before the war ended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of millions of people were displaced and became tools of the enemy, constantly devouring the last pure land of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losses caused by this cannot be estimated at all. The political, economic, and cultural systems were completely destroyed by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without decades to rest and recuperate, the Warhammer Kingdom would be hard-pressed to recover. Such a loss is undoubtedly a fatal blow to a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially at the threshold of the Ten Thousand Years Calamity, without enough strength in your hands, you can't sleep well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Joseph II didn't think that far at all. What the Warhammer Kingdom needs is the present. As for the future, it is not too late to think about it after overcoming the difficulties in front of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, things have already happened. It is meaningless to discuss whether the Moxi people's decision is correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most troublesome thing now is the orc cavalry. The army had only traveled less than a hundred miles, and we were attacked by the enemy seven times, losing thousands of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs have obviously changed their previous tactical habits and no longer confront us head-on. Instead, break up the army into parts, disperse them in regiments, and follow us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Discover a flaw and launch a sneak attack immediately. After each shot, you will immediately evacuate and never love to fight. We organized many counterattacks, but in the end we failed to catch the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that each attack has caused us little loss, but the damage to the morale of the army is irreparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the morale of our army drops to a certain level, the enemy will launch a large-scale storm in an attempt to...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Urgent report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Urgent Report\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military Affairs Minister Thiago hadn't spoken yet when he was interrupted by a sudden urgent report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the battle report in his hand, Joseph II's face became more and more gloomy. After a little hesitation, he said angrily: \"You are right. After our army's morale dropped, the enemy did launch a large-scale attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prophecy unfortunately came true, and Thiago was also very helpless. He doesn't want this crow's mouth property.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is the result of rational deduction, he is just telling the truth. Reason told him that this kind of bad news deduction would happen countless times in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, with an army of more than 600,000, the Warhammer Kingdom still has an absolute advantage in military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that having more soldiers does not mean being stronger. There are more than 100,000 orc troops entering the Warhammer Kingdom, and they are still dominated by cavalry troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom, which seems to have an advantage in military strength, has completely fallen into a passive strategy. Even if it is to carry out a strategic transfer, it is also full of crises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more frightening is that they have no choice. If they don't make a strategic transfer now, they will have no chance to transfer in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they haven't thought about standing still and waiting for help, but the problem lies in the terrible material consumption of the army, how to solve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is the enemy's conspiracy. They want to keep us on the plains and create opportunities for the next attack on the west of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I'm not mistaken, the real main target of the Orc Empire this time is us, and the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Alpha are just incidental! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Gay said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategy of the Orc Empire is definitely a disaster for the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    has become the main target of the enemy, and the situation they need to face next will become more severe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, everyone began to reflect on their previous responses. Unfortunately, there is no medicine for regret in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sighing, Joseph II said slowly: \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urges the Terran Alliance, we need reinforcements, reinforcements!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time strengthen the relationship with the Kingdom of Alpha and the Principality of Moxi. Especially the Alpha Kingdom, they have launched a counterattack now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even better if they could be persuaded to move their battle line westward, make a gesture of cutting off the back of the orc army, and disrupt the strategic deployment of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to let the 41st, 43rd, 46th, and 48th legions immediately reinforce...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Moxi, Hudson, who was determined to be safe, did not wait for the enemy to come to his door. While ordering people to build fortifications, they began to actively look for fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the detected information, there are as many as 800,000 orc troops heading south, and there are as many as 15 main elite legions alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the data on paper, the Terran coalition forces are definitely at a disadvantage. Now there is no one restricting the rear of the orcs, so they can safely output boldly when fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation that the enemy is strong and we are weak is not without benefits. The most direct impact is that the criticism of Hudson as the coach within the Principality of Moxi disappeared almost overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of survival, face is not worth mentioning. It is the best choice to improve the chances of winning without increasing the number of troops by letting Chang Sheng general be the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to win the war, the Moxi people also lowered their stance. The aristocrats who used to be aloof can now lower their stature and go to work as scouts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and the Griffon Cavalry has been consumed and only the seeds are left. Nobles with flying monsters became substitutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the number is too small, so we can only focus on the movement of the main orc army. More local investigations still rely on the scouts on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance efficiency, the information was passed back as soon as possible, and all the leaders were replaced by nobles with monster mounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The armies of the five royal courts of the orcs didn't act together this time?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Excellency the Earl. The orc army is now divided into five groups, coming from different roads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between each enemy army is about 30 to 50 miles, which happens to be almost a day's journey, and it should be to take care of each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is very vigilant, the Yingman has been hanging in the sky, and the wind and grass in the vicinity of tens of miles can hardly be hidden from their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is different for nobles to serve as scouts. Not only can they bring back information, but they can also analyze, filter, and extract effective information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of extravagant \"scout\" can only be used temporarily in times of crisis. In normal times, to toss the noble lord so much, he must rebel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This information is very important. Viscount Kenny, you have worked hard this time! Go down and rest first, and I will trouble you to continue later.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said politely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief adjustment, he has accepted the fact that the orc army is divided. If an army of 800,000 were to act together, the length of the team would be tens of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the arrangement is a little careless, when encountering a surprise attack by the human army, there will be a tragedy that cannot be taken care of from the beginning to the end. Even if there are eagle scouts who can detect the enemy's situation in advance, it will be very troublesome to mobilize the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the journey goes smoothly, the time spent by the army on the road will be greatly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there has always been a rule in the military: the larger the troops, the slower the march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, dividing troops is the best choice. The distance between each other is so far, it is entirely caused by the bad road conditions in the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main road suitable for the advancement of the army, the distance is so far apart. It is too late to temporarily open up a road. Unless you have the courage to abandon the road and take the trail, you can only accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locations of the five avenues were marked on the map, and a group of high-ranking generals surrounded them. Carefully looked at the map to find a way to defeat the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, the enemy's Fifth Route Army is too close, and the cavalry can arrive in an hour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to sneak attack them, unless you can end the battle in a short time, once the battle situation reaches a stalemate, the enemy will immediately encircle you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the enemy has anticipated our sneak attack and prepared in advance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity for a sneak attack is gone, which is undoubtedly bad news for the disadvantaged coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency is right, the enemy's arrangement is very difficult for a sneak attack. But no matter how difficult it is, it is also an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we get the Eagle scouts out of the way and ambush the troops ahead of time, we will have at least an hour and a half to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the five royal families of the orcs are not in harmony, this kind of matter that needs reinforcements will definitely be reported to their respective coaches for decision-making, and it will actually take longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculated based on one and a half hours of fighting time. Defeating the enemy army for such a period of time is definitely hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if you lower your expectations, it's not difficult to just create confusion for the enemy and delay the enemy's progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the sneak attack is launched at night, the damage it can cause will be even greater. There are not a few abandoned noble castles along the way. It shouldn't be difficult to choose a few places to hide soldiers, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direction of thinking about the problem is different, and the final result is also different. It is very difficult to defeat the enemy by using the enemy's division of troops, but it is very easy to create chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is only a delay of one day, it means that the enemy's attack will be delayed by one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has calculated that if the main road is destroyed, it will take at least 13 days for the orc army to reach Da Pest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time left for the enemy to attack is essentially only one month left. As long as the army is undefeated within a month, reinforcements from the Terran Alliance will arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every day is very important to the two warring parties, and directly determines the future fate of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's really not difficult to hide soldiers, but if we want to hide from Yingren's reconnaissance, we can only invest a small amount of troops and drive over by small roads at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, it is best for each troop to have no more than a thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, they must all be elite cavalry, so as to ensure that they can avoid the enemy's pursuit after launching a sneak attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small amount of troops invested, at most it will create a little chaos, and it may be difficult to cause much damage to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once entangled by the enemy, there is a risk of the entire army being wiped out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Fidelis objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a cautious general, he is not interested in any military adventures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of caution, although he missed many battle opportunities, it also allowed him to avoid many crises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time he encountered the Beamon Army in a field battle, he relied on this kind of cautious thinking to persevere under the enemy's strong attack and kept most of his troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also because of this caution that after the Beamon cavalry retreated, they did not dare to follow up with the knights, and missed an opportunity to wipe out the Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Fidelis, your way of thinking is the traditional style of play. The enemy we are facing now is the orcs, and a group of beasts are not worthy of us obeying the knight rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the necromancer with you, and arrange several hidden altars on the way. The dead orcs are the best sacrifices. Let the undead creatures and the orcs play the rest slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some traps can also be arranged along the way. If the enemy cavalry pursues them, they will be lured into the traps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to operate it, I think it is better to consult the mage group, presumably they will have a better way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, we have confirmed that the miniature crossbow bolts equipped with cavalry can play an unexpected role, and this time we can continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when targeting orc elite cavalry, using crossbow bolts to attack is more cost-effective. Toss the enemy a few more times along the way, and the losses caused will definitely hurt the enemy. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, the magic crossbow is the continental version of Aslante's \"gun\". If it is not too expensive, it can bring human civilization into the era of hot weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how high the cost is, when a country builds regardless of the cost, it can produce certain results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Hudson became the coach, he asked the alchemists in the royal capital to do their best. At present, fifteen Nissans have been produced, which is a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production capacity is indeed seriously insufficient, but relying on the contributions of the nobles and the original equipment in the army, we still managed to gather more than 3,000 miniature magic crossbows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a decisive battle with hundreds of thousands of people, such a tiny magic crossbow is not worth mentioning. But in a small cavalry duel, this is a big killer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Step by step, the distance is getting closer, and the atmosphere of chilling permeates between heaven and earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Emperor Beamon, who was sitting in the camp of the Chinese Army, stood upright under the handsome flag, without a trace of old age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he was using sharp eyes to size up the enemies that appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was used as bait, in order to make the show more realistic, this time he gathered all the elite troops in the vicinity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are thirty-five elite legions, and there are countless cannon fodder troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a lineup is enough to fight a war of annihilating the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team in front of me is only a part of the troops participating in the battle, but they are all elites of their own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these human armies can be annihilated in one fell swoop, the defense line of the Alpha Kingdom will become paper, and the vast plains will allow them to roam.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Infantry attack and fight the enemy hand-to-hand!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon ordered with a blank face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orcs are proficient in melee combat. In previous battles, their first choice was to approach quickly and fight in close quarters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, the advancing human army stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know when there was an extra sun in the sky, and the fire element between the sky and the earth surged wildly. The experienced orc priest hurriedly exclaimed:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, get out of the way. This is a forbidden spell—Fire Hell!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the \"Forbidden Curse\", Emperor Behemoth rushed to the rear and retreated for several miles before stopping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The agility of the body almost exceeds the visibility of the naked eye, and it is definitely a strong one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiery red sun descended from the sky, but the target was not the handsome flag, but fell on the Ursine heavy infantry regiment ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although everyone has heard the priest's reminder, it is obviously beyond the reach of ordinary orcs to avoid the curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the scorching flames, countless bear soldiers were wiped out without knowing what happened, and even the armor on their bodies melted into molten iron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A full bear army was gone, and the aftermath of the flames also spread to the nearby orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was okay to send him directly to see the Beast God, but the worst thing was the orc soldier who was affected and did not die immediately. One was roasted into a suckling pig, and he smelled his own meat before dying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although everyone is used to seeing life and death, this method of death still exceeds the inner capacity of many orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old Bimon Emperor was also full of anger. He just thought of running away when he heard the \"Forbidden Curse\" just now, and he lost his wise image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, he secretly scolded himself for being stupid. He didn't even get the secret method of longevity, so how could a strong human race kill him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said bluntly, now that \"Forbidden Curse\" sees him, he has to take a detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sacrificial group, Emperor Bimon is now full of fire. Venting anger is second, the key is that the enemy has prepared a forbidden spell, but they don't even know how to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a bit embarrassing for the priest, the \"Flaming Hell\" came so fast that there was no chance to interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one explanation for the enemy's ability to release the forbidden spell so quickly: there are enough strong ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The release speed of the forbidden spell mainly depends on the energy. The energy required by the forbidden spell is terrifying, and the gathering time will naturally not be short.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's only for individuals. When a large team of mages jointly attack, the time for energy gathering will undoubtedly be greatly shortened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation just now, the enemy not only gathered a group of fire magicians to jointly attack, but also used a large number of fire magic crystals to accelerate energy convergence with the help of magic circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he had time to explain to Emperor Bimon, the wind elements between heaven and earth began to gather again. Seeing this scene, the sacrificial group hurriedly intervened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it was too late. When they disturbed the sea of ​​elements, countless shining wind blades had already appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the forbidden spell of the wind element - Hell Wind Blade Dance, get down!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, the reminder from the old priest was a bit too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wind blades flying all over the sky have already entered the orc army and started harvesting. The most miserable is the cavalry, who stand high and see far, and sit high and die miserably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wind blades flying all over the sky really want to dance, but it costs money to appreciate other dances, and this dance is terrible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the previous flame hell, the coverage area of ​​Hell Wind Blade Dance is obviously larger, covering an area of ​​tens of thousands of square meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is still far from destroying a city, but in this specific occasion, the damage caused is not small at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being attacked by forbidden spells one after another, and the family's priest group was not strong enough. Under the control of panic, the orc army, which was already not well disciplined, fell into chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immersed in the blow of the enemy's forbidden spell, Emperor Bimon, unable to extricate himself, was so shocked that he could not speak at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's been so many years, I didn't expect to encounter the forbidden curse again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wanted to reprimand the sacrificial group for their incompetence, but seeing the few sacrificial priests accompanying the army, I swallowed the words again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously embarrassing the beast to count on the hundreds of priests accompanying the army to fight against thousands of higher-quality human mages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it's just interfering with spellcasting, this is beyond their ability. Who let the race make a lot of money this time, and a large group of strong people emerged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Bi Menghuang would not have believed that there are so many old immortals alive in the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrating the priests of the entire orc empire would at best interfere with the other party's spellcasting. The orc empire, which dominated the mainland at its peak, could do it if it wanted to rely on the sacrificial group to suppress the enemy's mage group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimon ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy doesn't play by the rules, and can no longer stay here and be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unlikely that the forbidden spells will be released continuously. The forbidden spells of the fire and wind systems have come out, but are there any magicians of other departments who have not shot it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as there are two great magisters or more than a dozen magisters joining forces, supplemented by a large group of fellow mages, it is possible to release the forbidden spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this lowest-standard forbidden spell not only has a reduced power, but also takes an unusually long casting time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forbidden curses of the human race gathered so quickly just now, and their power is not small among the forbidden curses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the two lines were ruled out, Emperor Beamon still didn't dare to stay and fight again. Especially after feeling the subtle magic fluctuations, he didn't dare to delay here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deaths are common in wars, but soldiers should not be allowed to die like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A forbidden curse took away tens of thousands of elites, and let the mages of the various races take turns to come, and the elites he brought out might lose more than half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I came here to lure the enemy, not to contribute to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all this army is lost, the military strength of the Orc Empire will directly drop by 30%. There is no need to continue the subsequent war at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bi Menghuang wants to run, hurry up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was an exclamation, and the Grand Master Knights rushed out. That indomitable momentum pressed down on the orc army like a mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Changsheng, any orc who dares to block their steps will regret coming to this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top master who was rarely seen in the past became the vanguard of the army at this moment, and the real massacre began.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc soldier in charge of the rear of the palace threw himself into the arms of the orc before he understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't too chaotic on the battlefield and they couldn't find the position of Emperor Bimon, it is estimated that they could leave the army and fight there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Army attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reacting, Marshal Campbell hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the person who hates the orcs the most, the Alpha Kingdom is definitely the first choice. How could the Royal Army be absent from this opportunity to beat the dog in the water?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enemy cavalry is fine, those guys are not easy to chase; but the two-legged infantry, Marshal Campbell is not going to let it go this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the enemy army has been lost, and the combat effectiveness is ten to seven. Annihilation may not be realistic, but there is still great hope for the disabled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was defeated like a mountain, and Emperor Bimon, who was in charge of the Chinese army, felt that he was running for his life in a hurry for the first time in a century.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that after a **** battle, I would slowly fall into a disadvantage, and then make a strategic shift to lure the enemy into the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, no matter how cunning and scheming, Emperor Bimeng still underestimated the allure of the secret method of longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human masters brought out this time, both in quantity and quality, exceeded his expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the heavy losses of the army, whether the traps set up can bury so many enemies, Emperor Bimeng has no idea at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back at the group of guys flying in the sky, Bi Menghuang involuntarily accelerated his escape speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The picture is really brutal. The Eagle Legion, which was in charge of harassing the enemy from the air and buying time for the army to retreat, directly **** up those old immortals with blood flying all over the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of sky knights and great magisters were flying above, and Emperor Bimon felt—bitter!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the fault of the prodigal ancestors. If the orc empire hadn't declined, they wouldn't have been bullied by the enemy like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send experts to intercept, that doesn't exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Emperor Bimon was surrounded by masters of the same level to guard him, and even he himself was not weaker than those guys, the difference in numbers between the two sides was too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that it was not easy for the Bimon Royal Court to accumulate such a small family fortune, and it is better not to prodigal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chase and fleeing battle is still going on, but the army following Beamon Emperor is less and less, and the enemy's pursuers are getting closer and closer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fleeing all the way, I don't know how many orc soldiers paid the price of their lives in order to intercept the enemy and buy him time to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These military operations were spontaneously organized by the most loyal generals. The master with a dark heart had long realized that the target of the chasing soldiers was Emperor Bimeng, so he left the team early,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that these actions of his direct subordinates are meaningless, Emperor Bimeng can only pretend not to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bait is not so easy to use. Once the enemy finds out that something is wrong, all previous efforts will be wasted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all old foxes, who have seen various scenes at a large age. It is not easy for everyone to live to the present age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Closer, closer!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The destination is close at hand, and the eyes of Emperor Beamon burst out with hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faster, faster. The galloping behemoth has already left the army behind, and only a small number of masters can keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Something is wrong, the enemy actually broke away from the army, is there really Emperor Bimeng among those people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False and real, true and false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That old guy, Bi Menghuang, is not bad at using troops, so there may be fraud in it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison, you know the most about this old neighbor. Is there anything you want to say? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An old magister said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the top powerhouses of the Alpha Kingdom, he is also a retired member of the royal family. Morrison has been dealing with orcs for most of his life, and has participated in countless battles, large and small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing he knows about his old enemy, Bi Menghuang, is what he eats every meal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After all, it is an old overlord with some special means, which is also understandable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let everyone be careful, and shoot directly if something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I always feel that the enemy is deliberately leading us here, maybe there is something waiting for us in the valley ahead. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison's words made everyone look a little dignified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this point, it is impossible to give up. Strength has brought sufficient confidence to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many top experts gathered, even if the orc empire has a few sanctuary powerhouses ambushing here, they can handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the continent of Aslante, there is no place they cannot go to. If there is one, perhaps there is only the legendary Dragon Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A huge explosion sounded, and for a while there was flying sand and rocks in the valley, and you couldn't see your fingers when you stretched out your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The astonishing mutation made Emperor Bimon and his party who entered the valley look extremely ugly. The enemy hasn't come in yet, but the enemy's attack has come one step ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the enemy seems to have noticed something, and did not rush in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Start the blood sacrifice in advance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a distance, even after the door of the abyss opens, they cannot escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we let them continue to test like this, all the sacrifices we prepared will be tossed and useless, and I am afraid that we will not be able to attract enough powerful demons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reminder from the old priest made Emperor Bimon wake up instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, go host!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others, get ready, once the gate of the abyss opens, we will leave here immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be no hesitation, except for sacrifices, all living beings are their blood food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they lock the breath, it will be a big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Emperor Bimeng's serious expression, everyone nodded in response. They don't want to taste the feast specially prepared for the strong of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ancient sacrificial song sounded, and a tiny slit appeared above the altar, and the blood beads on the ground gave off an evil breath, drifting away along the slit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of boys and girls who were escorted by soldiers had their wrists cut off one after another. The blood flowed slowly along the blood nest, and under the infestation of blood beads, it was like an abyss of Styx.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other side of the slit, as if drugs had been released, nearby demons floated over one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow the cracks one by one, trying to squeeze in and out, trying to cross the boundary to enjoy the feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that just as I poked my head out, it was swallowed by the turbulent space in the middle, as if to warn outsiders: Those who cross the boundary will die!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a little difficulty obviously cannot scare the greedy demon. Every day in the abyss, absorbing the chaotic atmosphere, negative emotions are infinitely magnified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The space turbulence devoured some demons, but more demons continued to join in, and the cracks in space continued to expand with the joint efforts of all the demons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the old priest smiled slightly, as if he was enjoying the most beautiful music.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly concentrating, he murmured to himself: \"Dozens of them died just now, and the number of introductions seems to be a bit insufficient, unable to exert the maximum power of these blood beads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, anyway, they will die anyway, so let's use waste!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Presumably, His Majesty will not object, and if he is really an important confidant, he will not arrange this deadly task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You guys immediately call all the soldiers in the valley, I have something to tell. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It seems that there is something wrong with this hidden valley. Why don't you try to put a forbidden spell in it first?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison suggested with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are the only old guys who can talk about releasing the forbidden spell so easily and comfortably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Come on, Morrison. You have a deep blood feud with Emperor Beamon. If you want to take the opportunity to kill him, we have no objection, but we have to wait until you find out the secret method of longevity.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A emaciated grand magister replied angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all half-bodied people who are about to sink into the ground, and the secret of longevity is close at hand. If you don't catch Emperor Bimeng and force him to question him, who can be reconciled?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kurt, you have wronged people. If Emperor Beamon was so easy to kill, he wouldn't be alive now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The movement of the forbidden spell is so loud, as long as we release the forbidden spell a little slower, the old man can definitely dodge it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the Beamon family also has some background. As far as I know, there is an artifact armor in the hands of Emperor Bimon. Even if he can't fully utilize the power of the artifact, it's not so easy to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he wasn't hit by a single-target assault-type forbidden spell, his life would have been lost at all. If you want to ask about the secret method of longevity, it is just right to beat him half to death. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Matters involving \"longevity\" should not be misunderstood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the masters present are all high-ranking masters, and their desire to survive is extraordinarily strong. Whoever dares to stand in their way of eternal life is their endless enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Morrison is right. It is not so easy to die than Menghuang. It has come to this point, it is always right to be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This valley is too weird, and the concentration of death aura is not what ordinary valleys should have. One can tell at a glance that it is piled up by mountains of corpses and seas of blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also an evil breath of the abyss, maybe there is a gap connecting the abyss here. If he didn't stop it, it would be a big trouble if Emperor Beamon released a group of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget about forbidden spells, just throw a few super-level magics in and try it out first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A benevolent old magician echoed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rich experience is different. With so many strong people gathered, no matter how secretive Bi Menghuang did, some people can see the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone looked at each other, then nodded in agreement. There are some things where doubt is enough and no proof is needed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the valley trembled and the mountains shook, as if it had been overturned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earth-type ultra-level magic - earth-shaking!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recognizing the attack from the enemy, Emperor Bimon who was hiding in the secret passage of the valley glanced at the secret passage that was beginning to collapse, and rushed out of the secret passage and returned to the valley.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are enemies outside the valley, and going out at this moment is to deliver goods to your door. Even if he knew that if he stayed in the valley, he might become the first target of the devil's attack, he had no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn human bastards, I curse you...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scolding had just begun, and Emperor Bimon was forced to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless demons just squeezed out of the abyss crack, rushed towards them with claws and teeth, and evil laughter of \"Jie Jie\" from their mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at their eyes, it was like people who had been hungry for three days, and a bunch of delicacies suddenly appeared in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"run!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea had just been born, and the figures rushed out without the slightest hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemies outside want the secret of longevity, and they will not kill them easily before they succeed, but this group of demons in front of them is different, they only need their flesh and soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment a few people fled, the entire valley was also overturned. The flying dust and falling rocks all over the sky allowed the group of drooling demons to successfully live a life of eating dirt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the overturned altar, the old priest cursed secretly. Without the guidance of the coordinates of the altar, it is almost impossible to accurately smuggle through the turbulent flow of time and space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the group of demons in front of them, expecting them to die together with the strong human race outside is obviously not very reliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Little Behemoth, you are the one who summoned this king?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the disrespectful voice, the old priest was not only not annoyed, but showed a secretly delighted smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, he summoned a powerful monster. I don't know if he can kill the strong human race outside, but at least he won a chance to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Lord Demon King!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if satisfied with the title, the nine-headed monster with fangs and waving wings nodded slightly, and then asked:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why are the sacrifices outside full of stagnation, don't you know that this king likes pure soul and flesh the most?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the greeting, the old priest cursed a fool inwardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him told him that the devil in front of him seemed to have a bad mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't figure out what the situation was, and actually took the enemies outside as his sacrifices. If you still want to purify your soul, go dreaming!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really regarded him as a devil believer, and he could give everything for the power bestowed by the devil!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Demon King, the outside is only a part of the sacrifice, you can make do with it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the material plane, there are as many pure souls as you want, wait...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the words were finished, the magical attack that foreshadowed the ground had already fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, the situation inside the valley has been exposed. Facing a group of demons, the strong human race will not hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn humans, you are looking for death! You all go out with this king and tear up the scum outside!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The demon king roared in anger, and rushed outside with the remaining younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of the gap between the melee between the two sides, the old priest hurriedly tore open a space scroll and fled, and he was ten miles away in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Space magicians are rare, and there are even fewer magicians who can make teleportation scrolls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is completely using one and missing one. This was harvested by the old priest during an expedition and has been treasured until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Move ten miles at once, and escape to the treasure properly. The only problem is that you can't control the position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the old priest is very unlucky right now, he just fell a dog and ate shit, and went back to the way they originally escaped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just getting up from the ground, before he had time to stabilize his body, there were bursts of shouts in his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fall on the battlefield\", it's useless to understand, the big spears of the nearby human knights have already stabbed him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dodging one shot and another, let a priest playing magic fight hand-to-hand with a knight, or be surrounded by a group of people, there is really no way to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic shield withstood a few attacks, and then was stabbed to death by random gunshots, showing less than one point of his full strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rushing out of the valley, he was surrounded by many powerful people from the human race. He was dumbfounded when he just finished smuggling all the demons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the perception just now deceived the devil. Many strong people of the human race hide their own aura very unkindly, unless they see it with their own eyes, they can't find it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought it was a blood meal prepared for them outside, but I didn't expect that it would become their grave as soon as they emerged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The demon king headed by him was also very nervous. As a stowaway, his strength was severely suppressed. When adapting to the rules of the new world, he was unable to use many methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stupid humans, hurry up and surrender to the great Demon King Dorag, and offer your soul and flesh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The demon king hasn't figured out how to end it yet, and the demon brother under his command has already gone out to make a noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, what greeted him was \"Justice Fist Trial\". Just halfway through the provocative words, he was instantly killed by a strong human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that demons like to toss people the most, offering their souls and flesh and blood. Doesn't it mean that they can't live or die?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have something to discuss, I'm just passing by. What do you like to do, it has nothing to do with me, leave!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Drago's figure had disappeared in place. This material plane is too dangerous. Outside any valley, there are so many strong men who are second only to him in strength, and they are not suitable for demons to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to survive and grow up in the abyss of intrigue, what Duo LaGe is best at is judging the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't win, run away, there is no shame for the devil. The ones who really need to be despised are the unlucky ones who want to run away but don't run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dorag was unlucky. He had just fled halfway, when a huge sword with a cold light slashed at him head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dodged the fatal blow, and a bolt of lightning accurately landed on his head, shaking Drago trembling all over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The body stayed for a short time, and countless attacks fell on him one after another. At the critical moment, the natural instinct began to exert its power. After paying the price of giving up a head, the aura of Drago's whole body rose sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stupid human beings, you have successfully angered the Demon King, so die now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a strong evil aura continued to gather towards Mundolag's body, as if preparing to explode himself, causing everyone to back away in fright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after, Drago's body became nothingness, and he appeared in the valley in the blink of an eye. Self-destruction is impossible. As a qualified devil king, lying is only the basic cultivation of a devil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy is still in the valley. This is the fire demon king. His strength may exceed that of ordinary sanctuaries. Hurry up and release the water curse - Frozen World to suppress his strength!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison shouted hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Demons are already terrifying, and with the addition of a \"king\", they are even more invincible in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Demon King in front of him escapes, it will definitely bring a heavy disaster to countless creatures on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing the seriousness of the problem, a group of water magicians took action one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The temperature between the sky and the earth began to drop sharply in an instant, and the whole world turned into a vast expanse of whiteness, as if it was frozen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dorag, who was still looking for his way back in the valley, immediately realized that something was wrong, but he was besieged by a group of strong humans just as he emerged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The demon king at the sanctuary level is indeed powerful, but he, the demon king who just stowed away, is an exception. Many tricks are halfway through, and they are forced to stop because they violate the laws of heaven and earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the change of the surrounding environment, the flame that was originally wrapped around Drago was left with only a small flame at this moment, as if it might be extinguished at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The body was not seriously injured, but the strength of the whole body was suppressed by half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The altar was destroyed again, and even the last crack in space was naturally repaired by the law of heaven and earth during the delay just now, so there is no way for him to return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn you guys!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, Hudson, who was preparing to attack with a large army, was confused by a good news from China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great victory on the front line, defeating an army of one million orcs in one fell swoop, beheading 300,000 main force of orcs, and killing Bemon fled north in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are chasing and killing the fleeing orcs while regaining lost ground. The \"Master Knights\" of the vanguard have already entered the land of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific situation was not introduced. I don't know if the high-level officials are blocking the news, or they don't know the specific situation on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you say it, this big victory is a timely rain for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the record needs to be discounted, it is true that they defeated the orc army of one million and chased the Beamon Emperor and fled north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shocking victory will directly change the power structure within the Orc Empire. Emperor Beamon, who had lost troops on the front line, was no longer qualified to be the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on the losses of the five royal families. If everyone shares the same loss, then the balance of power can continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a certain family, or two of them lose their strength, the already fragile political balance of the Orc Empire will be shattered in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The balance was broken. For the five orc royal families, the joint invasion of the human race became a secondary event, and the more important thing was to preserve their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing to the human race is only a small problem. In the past years, they have failed countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how hard the morale of the army is hit, after a few decades, when the younger generation grows up, they will forget the failure and come back again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, failure in internal fighting is the real failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire at its peak was not ruled by the five royal families, but many races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson also admires the guy who founded the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original political structure of the Orc Empire, if it is operated properly, there is every chance to integrate the many races on the continent of Aslant and establish a huge regime that unifies the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, although the intention of the framework is high enough, the Orc Empire is also full of openness, and any race can join it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the operation of multi-race alliances and continuous recruitment of people that has created the continental hegemony of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how good the system is, it can't withstand the erosion of interests in the end. It was agreed that ten thousand races would rule together, but as the number of races added, internal struggles became more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The addition of one race after another pushed the orc empire to its peak, and at the same time pulled them down to hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the most prominent period, not only the human race was forced to join, but even the arrogant elves were forced to submit applications for admission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the peak moment when the unification of the continent was about to be completed, no enemy could be found in the whole continent, and the contradictions within the orc empire were also intensified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The races that were originally forced to join the gang first fanned the flames within the empire, and after the civil strife broke out, they went out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire has turned from prosperity to decline, but its hegemony is still barely maintained. It wasn't until the land of Aslant Continent was almost divided up by everyone that the parties really started to confront each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few mentions in the history books, and it has entered the era of the chosen race—the human race dominating the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many secrets are hidden behind, Hudson also doesn't know. After all, he is not a historian and has no interest in delving into the story behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why he was able to think of these things was because he vaguely grasped a thread, that is: to concentrate on attacking one of the five royal families and forcibly provoke internal fighting in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the birth rate of the five royal families of the orcs is not high, even if they dominate the entire empire, they cannot become stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the southward invasion, just suppressing the countless races within the empire is enough to exhaust them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, the orc empire may return to the era of autonomy of hundreds of ethnic groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a strong unified regime, there would be only orcs but no empire, and at most it could be regarded as a \"loser's front alliance\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the major races on the mainland with a glorious history of civilization, the many races within the orcs are really powerless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the current five royal families of orcs are inconspicuous small families in the Aslante continent alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is a man of action, he has an idea and implements it. Although he didn't know the respective losses of the five royal clans of the orcs, Hudson still set his sights on his old opponent, the bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. Who made the bear people mostly infantry?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a big rout on the front line, when they run for their lives in a hurry, the infantry will definitely not be able to outrun the cavalry. Especially heavy infantry wearing thick armor, there is almost no chance to run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that the bear royal court will lose the most, so if you continue to catch the bear army and beat them hard, then there must be nothing wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There is no point in arranging a small group of cavalry to take the trail to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Excellency Earl. This morning, the orc army suddenly returned the same way. They walked in a hurry, and even some of the siege equipment carried by the army were thrown in the middle of the road, as if something happened in the rear.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kenny's words reminded Hudson of the Kingdom victory letter he had just received.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the group of old antiques lead the way in front, and the army of the Alpha Kingdom follows all the way into the Orc Empire, then it makes sense for the enemy to withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destroying the Principality of Moxi is important, but compared to his own lair, it is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army is genocide against the human race, so why not the human army against the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hatred accumulated by the two sides for countless years has already become as deep as the sea. If there is a chance to enter the orc empire for revenge, the kingdom will never give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The failure of the great battle will definitely trigger a chain reaction, leading to the collapse of the orc army on the front line of the Alpha Kingdom. Hudson will not be surprised at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this defeat, although the orc empire was not so weak that it could not resist, their interior was indeed empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just relying on the few retreated soldiers from the Alpha Kingdom, plus the remaining troops inside the Orc Empire, there is a high probability that they will not be able to stop the kingdom's major counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, it is very necessary to withdraw the frontline troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Man is not as good as heaven. With the withdrawal of the orc army, all of Hudson's deployments are now useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have happened, Hudson can only comfort himself: without fighting a battle, he took the position of commander-in-chief of the coalition forces for nothing, and it's not a loss!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the map on the wall, he has already observed a moment of silence for the Warhammer Kingdom. The principality of Moxi can be given up because it is no longer profitable for the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Warhammer Kingdom is different. There are still hundreds of thousands of orcs in their country. Basically, they are all valuable elite troops. If these troops are not brought out, the orcs will definitely not retreat with confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing cannot be discussed with the Warhammer Kingdom: Let the people open the defense line and let their troops come out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay not to discuss it, but if you go to others, you will only stop them harder. No matter how many conditions are promised, it is meaningless. It is impossible for the Warhammer Kingdom to feel at ease with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Human Race Alliance is still watching, let the orc army leave directly, and be labeled as colluding with the orcs, so don't even think about mixing in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the discussion fails, then the only option is to forcibly break a hole in the defense line of the Warhammer Kingdom and forcibly lead the army out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is another option, and that is to let the orc expeditionary force that penetrated into the Principality of Moxi return along the original route and bypass the defense line of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pass that blocked the road is gone, but the distance that needs to be traveled has increased by thousands of kilometers out of thin air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the time delay, but the local snakes along the way must be willing to let them pass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Orton is not qualified to stop them, but it is hard to say when it comes to the Principality of Moxi. As long as Hudson is still the coach, it is definitely impossible to let them go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving the main force of more than a hundred thousand orcs, Hudson didn't have such a good appetite, but it was very easy to delay for 20 or 30 days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding the time it took for the orc army to travel, the alliance reinforcements also came. It is not a problem at all for the two sides to work together to eat these troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guessing that the orcs also weighed the pros and cons, they were not sure about destroying the Principality of Moxie before the arrival of alliance reinforcements, so they turned their heads to bully the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson felt that he still had a share of the credit. \"Famous general halo\" has a great bonus effect when evaluating military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the \"No. 1 General\" has a lot of moisture, it's all blown out, and the Xiongren Emperor's Court and Bimon Emperor's Court can't slap themselves in the face!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you squeeze the water, it is still at the level of a titan. No amount of special reasons can obliterate Hudson's real combat exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wasting time with a \"famous player\" who can fight, it is better to bully someone who has no record, and the winning rate will be higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who let Warhammer Kingdom's performance fail? Gathering an army of 700,000, and being led by the nose by the Orc Expeditionary Army, it was entirely to boost the morale of the Orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now, relying on piecemeal tactics, a quarter of the 700,000 troops have been consumed. Judging from the current battlefield situation, before the Warhammer Kingdom completes its strategic shift, the army will be almost exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparing each other, you will know who is more like a soft persimmon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guards, immediately send down orders to notify all troops to cancel all military operations!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kenny, you continue to lead people to watch the orc army until they leave the Principality of Moxi. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemies have all run away, so the plan naturally doesn't need to continue. But the monitoring still has to continue, and the rest just wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no battle to be fought, and Hudson will not resign immediately as the coach. Being able to stay in the position for one more day counts as one day, and taking the opportunity to gain reputation as much as possible is the kingly way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it is always difficult to appoint the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces, and it is even more difficult to dismiss the position. Even if someone wants to pick peaches, they dare not act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves diplomatic relations between the two countries, and without making a big mistake, Hudson can completely stay in position until the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an important political qualification, and it is also applicable after returning to the country, directly entering the kingdom's commander-in-chief candidate list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoa...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amid the cries and shouts of killing, the Beamon cavalry drove the refugee army away and captured a human city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig has long been immune to this scene, and even fell in love with this \"alternative music performance\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that his plan to go deep into the heart of the human race to sabotage is completely feasible. Each small country was directly swallowed by the refugee tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After each victory, the refugee team will grow stronger. Before he knew it, he had amassed an army of millions of refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the impact of the refugee wave, the production and economy of many small countries along the way have been devastated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few strong cities left, and they can be preserved because Prince Butzweig doesn't want to waste precious time on a few meaningless cities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the chaotic siege team, Prince Butzweig smiled slightly. He likes to see the scenes of human race killing each other and consuming their own strength for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The refugee army has almost gathered, and it should cause some trouble to the Alpha Kingdom. If this delay continues, the situation on the front line may not be able to support it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig was busy thinking secretly, when a voice suddenly interrupted his train of thought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, something is wrong! There is news from the imperial court that our army on the front line of the Alpha Kingdom has suffered a crushing defeat. Even Your Majesty is dying now...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the visitor could finish speaking, Prince Butzweig stood up from his seat, stepped forward, grabbed the document and flipped through it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real situation is three points more cruel than what someone described. The failure of the Great War directly brought the Orc Empire to the edge of a cliff. If you are not careful, you will fall and be smashed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the unknown of Emperor Beamon's life and death made Prince Butzweig feel anxious. Let's put aside the matter of seizing the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without Emperor Bimon in charge, the crown prince who only knows how to eat, drink and have fun is not optimistic at all if he wants to deal with the current complicated situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inherent impression is not easy to change. Even though Crown Prince Alex performed very well on the front line, the prejudice he had developed long ago still affected Prince Butzweig's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is difficult, and internal disputes will arise, which is really worrying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These negative emotions did not last long, and Prince Butzweig recovered. The problems that may be faced in the country cannot be changed by him. The key is the current troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an army of refugee waves, but with the collapse of the situation, the original plan has been difficult to meet expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is not a small country. Without the cooperation of the frontline army, it is too difficult to destroy a kingdom with just a group of refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't kill the enemy, the possibility of being killed by the enemy is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court has decided to withdraw its troops. It is almost inevitable to stay in the hinterland of the human race for a long time and bury their bones in a foreign land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Behemoth Legion has harmed all directions along the way, and provoked countless enemies. These small countries may not dare to attack at other times, but it is necessary for the enemy to find out that they want to run away and add chaos along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the route borrowed from the Principality of Moxi, which has now been blocked by Hudson. Only by running to the Warhammer Kingdom and joining the troops there can it be possible to tear through the enemy's line of defense and break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army will immediately march towards the Alpha Kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After working so hard for so long, there was a wave of refugees, and it couldn't just be wasted like this. No matter how much trouble you can cause the enemy, you have to take it out and try the effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sleepy is coming, send a small chapter\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
