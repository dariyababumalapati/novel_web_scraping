They are all sequelae left by the war. From Yingrenhuang's eyes that want to kill people, it can be seen how much he has opinions on Xiongrenhuang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old Ghost Xiong, shouldn't you give me an explanation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ying Renhuang's stern question broke the silence. Obviously, the loss of the Three Thousand Eagles had made it difficult for him to restrain his emotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the five royal families of the orcs, the Beamon clan is the rarest, followed by the Eagle clan, with a total population barely exceeding seven figures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although all the orcs are all soldiers, men, women and children can go to the battlefield, that is only possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the eagle people as an example, the young and the elderly can't fly after a few thumps in the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost the ability to fly, the air force became an army, and the advantage of the Eagle people over other races no longer existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of three thousand Ying people in one fell swoop was greater than the loss in the surprise attack on Fort Augustus that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Confession, what do you want to explain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The command of the Eagle Army is in your own hands. They are going into the city themselves, and I did not order them to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    伱The eagle soldiers suffered heavy losses, so they came to me to ask for an explanation; the bear warriors suffered even more losses, who should I ask for an explanation? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang replied angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss was heavy, and both of them were filled with anger. As the same victim, although he understands Yingrenhuang's feelings, it does not mean that he can accept this accusation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong's temper came up, and he didn't bother to continue to save face. What happened has already been explained. Believe it if you love it, if you don't believe it, you will be defeated, anyway, he has a clear conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"you you…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Yingrenhuang was so angry that he could not speak, and was about to turn into a full-fledged martial artist, the three people watching the excitement couldn't sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle emperor appeases his anger, the dead cannot be resurrected. I think this incident is all due to the conspiracy of the human race, trying to provoke internal fighting between us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment, you must keep calm, and you must not fall into the conspiracy of the human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, there is nothing wrong with using conspiracy theories to blame the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how nonsense this excuse is, the Lion Emperor doesn't care, and neither do the other emperors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is dead, no matter how hard they struggle, they can't survive, and now it's just a matter of saving face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want revenge, you have to find the enemy. It is a pity that Earl Langton, who planned all this, and the tool man responsible for the specific implementation, were all wiped out in the battle that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orc priest took action and searched the entire battlefield, he couldn't find any remnants of the enemy. If you want to vent your anger, you can't find the right owner now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two made dissatisfaction almost at the same time. It seems that they broke up unhappy, but in fact it is a statement to temporarily expose this period of grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past endless years, the internal disputes among the five royal families have never stopped, and countless contradictions have accumulated long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the pressure from the human race, they would have been able to fight themselves. The unity obtained by force is only superficial after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rush, in the end it is cheaper for others, everyone is not so stupid. But digging pits and plotting against each other never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the farce came to an end, Crown Prince Alex, who represented the Bimon court, spoke first: \"Now, let's talk about sending troops!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a long time, I estimate that everyone's preparations are almost completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the previous agreement, I, the Bimon tribe and the Yingren tribe each dispatched one legion, and the remaining three tribes dispatched two legions each.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon clan will abide by the agreement, you have no problem, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Alex set his sights on the Eagle Emperor and Bear Emperor. In recent days, these two have suffered the most losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the bear tribe who attacked the Bethel fortress, directly tossed and lost a legion. Now dispatching two legions to participate in the operation at one time will inevitably cause a shortage of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, while besieging the city of Dapace, they also have to be optimistic about their own rear, and they cannot let the human army come out of the fortress to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My Yingren family values ​​credibility the most, and what we promise will naturally be done. However, because of the previous battles, several of our legions are now dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total strength of the legion sent this time is only 9,000. It is still sufficient to suppress the enemy's air power. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Yingrenhuang gave Xiongrenhuang a provocative look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you look at, if you Ying people can fulfill their promises, our bear people will naturally not lag behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two elite infantry regiments are ready and ready to go at any time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as soon as the words were spoken, he began to regret them. Feeling angry for a while, the crematorium afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five imperial courts all have their own missions. This time, the Bearmen took the Bethel Fortress and took the lead in opening the road to the south, making outstanding contributions to the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it was possible to ask several other companies to share a part of the bear people in the next operation, but now they have no time to raise it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although remedial measures can be taken in the future, the fact that the bear people sent troops to the two legions is a foregone conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King and the Silver Moon Wolf King followed suit. It can be seen that they are in a good mood and are very satisfied with the current results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the number of elites of each race has been determined, there is nothing to discuss about miscellaneous soldiers. Cannon fodder is something that everyone has in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though tens of thousands of vassal races were lost in the previous battle to attack the Bethel Fortress, the Bear Emperor did not worry about this problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The era of tight military strength has not yet arrived. Generally, the shortage of troops occurs in the middle and late stages of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the battle line continues to stretch and the Human Race Alliance reinforcements arrive one after another, the Orc Empire will not be able to support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since everyone is fine, then the speed of the soldiers is very important. Everyone go back and gather troops now, and try to set off within ten days.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Alex said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are eight main armies alone, plus everyone's vassal races, the total strength will not be less than 250,000, even if it is not 300,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even on the front line, it is not an easy task to gather so many troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moreover, they are divided into five major camps, which increases the difficulty of transfer. It is definitely a challenge to assemble the team and start within ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Fort, after getting familiar with defense, Hudson once again started his familiar military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the training of the officers and soldiers of the Wright County Legion strengthened, but other troops in the city are also within the training range, and even the civilians who follow the assistants are not spared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All able-bodied men, women and children in the city, from the age of sixty-five to the age of twelve, were pulled out by Hudson for military training. It's just that the relative training intensity has been reduced a lot, and it is mainly defensive training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The frenzied plan to turn all the people into soldiers was completely implemented in the Flying Bear Castle. As the de facto supreme commander, Hudson has completely let himself go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Objections are useless, and what is being played is militarism. The orcs came here, regardless of gender, age or age. Go to the battlefield without a weapon, just wait to be slaughtered by the enemy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a price, the materials stored in Flying Bear Castle were rapidly consumed. It was unknown whether the materials originally planned to be used by the soldiers and civilians in the city for three years could last for two years under Hudson's calamity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that playing like this is dangerous, Hudson couldn't care less. Judging from the current situation, the situation in the Principality of Moxi is already quite dangerous, and it may collapse at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in Flying Bear Castle is relatively good. As the owner, the Erwin family has been operating in the local area for hundreds of years, and the family background is strong enough to have so many material reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, send someone to urge the logistics department, let them quickly replenish the horses for us, and the weapons and equipment owed to me must not be missing.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prophet of Spring River Plumbing Duck. As a commander on the front line, the big noise made by the orcs couldn't be hidden from his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who the orc army is attacking, once the flames of war ignite, it will become very difficult to obtain these strategic supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the hatred is getting too much, and Hudson has to feel guilty. He won two battles successively, but correspondingly offended the two royal families of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is revenge, he, a guard full of hatred, will most likely become the focus of attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance the survivability on the battlefield, the current Master Hudson can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in addition to improving the city's defense capabilities, one of the main purposes is to select a reserve source of troops from young and strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a guest army, other situations are easy to talk about, except that it is difficult to replenish personnel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are fighting less and less, which is very dangerous for any army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to asking the Mosi people for recruits, Hudson still prefers to train them by himself. In times of war, these are minor issues as long as you can keep winning battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some officers and soldiers were transferred from the Wright County Legion to serve as the backbone force, and an under-recruited recruit legion and an excess city defense legion were added to the Fort of Flying Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of new recruits is all civilian laborers and craftsmen who were obtained from the logistics department, plus some young and strong recruits from the Fort of Flying Bears. The total strength is only more than 5,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The organization of the city defense corps became chaotic. The private army of the local nobles, including the Erwin family, and the men, women and children who participated in the training were all incorporated into the city defense corps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said to be a legion, but it is actually a hodgepodge. It can be seen from the name that their characterization is - defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combat strength is not extravagant, as long as it can play a certain role in defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, the recruit army is the focus of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary to provide supplementary troops for the main army, but also to undertake the duties of engineers. Temporarily repairing bridges and paving roads, and building some simple ordnance are all their tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Busy life is always full and helpless. He pays close attention to military training every day, so much so that Hudson forgets the \"caravan\" he saved halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of the cold treatment is to let the Leibolong family live like a year. The circle of upper-class nobles is not big, so how could no one know them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment they entered Flying Bear Castle and settled down, their identities were exposed. They were greeted with neither applause nor accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from being unable to leave, no action was taken against them as if they didn't exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being ignored is the most terrible thing. Hudson's forgetting has plunged the Liboron family into endless panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, the situation is not good. Raquel and William have no opinions at all, and all the power of Flying Bear Castle falls into the hands of the Earl of Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He hasn't contacted us for such a long time, I'm afraid that Earl of Hudson has a big plan. Once he gets hold of it, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony said bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a veteran nobleman, he still has a lot of connections. It's just that people are leaving the tea to cool down now, and the Principality has yet to characterize the declining Leboron family, and everyone's attitude towards them is also very complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to inquire about some news, but it is a bit difficult to get everyone to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main problem is that the two aristocratic leaders, Raquel and William, are now in a state of difficulty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he has no opinion, but in fact he has to do it. Giving up the dominance will at most lose some face, but fighting for the dominance may cost one's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no fluke in the face of war, if you can do it, you can do it, if you can't do it, you can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his own abilities and the strength in his hands are not good enough, it is not surprising that he chooses to hang out with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is true for the two highest status, not to mention the nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all smart people, no one wants to die on the battlefield for no reason, so naturally they will not offend the boss for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most critical thing is that Hudson didn't do anything to the Liboron family. Although the treatment provided is slightly worse, who let them claim to be a caravan?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The treatment of a businessman cannot be compared with that of a nobleman. Along the way was the fate of gnawing on black bread. After entering Flying Bear's Fort, he was taken care of by relatives and friends, and then he improved slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This improvement is only reflected in life. Before Hudson spoke, no one dared to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One or two days, they can still hold their breath. After a long time, I can't help but think wildly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Find an opportunity to visit the Earl of Hudson! Some things are clearly on the table, which is more beneficial than the current delay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The details of our departure from the Bethel fortress are not known to outsiders at all. As long as he firmly insisted that he broke out after the city was broken, then there would be no problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For so long, nothing was done to us. Presumably the Earl of Hudson has not yet found evidence against us, otherwise he would have sent someone over to negotiate with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not too late to make a decision if we simply explore his background and see what this famous earl wants to get from us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old magister said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the sad look on his brows, but it still reveals his inner anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that this was the beginning, and Hudson was definitely not the only one who was eyeing the inheritance of the Liboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a chance, the nobles in the city, big and small, don't mind coming up to share a piece of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action was taken, mainly due to the protection of the rules of the game, or the face of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is willing to bear the notoriety of extortion. Even if you want to take action, you have to find a high-sounding reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having no excuses doesn't mean they are safe. You can't do anything to them on the surface, but it doesn't affect the secret hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the restraint on the surface, the secret methods of the nobles are truly bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There may be people with high morals, but the old magister dare not gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

We have confirmed with Viscount William that they are indeed members of the Leblon family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson may not care about their identities, but it does not mean that his subordinates do not care. If the master asks one day, wouldn't it be embarrassing if he didn't know anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he arrived at Flying Bear's Castle, Tom went to Viscount William to verify the identity of the \"caravan member\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, Viscount William, who had no time to communicate beforehand, sold them upside down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was a report, but the timing was unlucky. It was at the busiest time of Hudson, so he directly treated it as an unimportant trivial matter and let his subordinates take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To retaliate against these guys for concealing their identities, Tom simply pretended not to know, and provided them with treatment that matched his status as a businessman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confused operation, confused the nobles in the city. Before knowing Hudson's true thoughts about the Liboron family, no one dared to approach them rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for limited living care, no one went to see them, as if they really regarded them as businessmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring Sir Anthony in!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the war, the number of down-and-out nobles has been increasing day by day. If everyone pays attention, Hudson will be too busy even if he is exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the loud noise from the Bethel Fortress, he might not even be able to remember the Liboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having an impression does not mean that you need to deal with it. The current Leboron family is worthy of outsiders' concern, only the family inheritance and those guards are left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for the guards to think about it. They are either members of the Leiboron family or dead soldiers trained by them. There is no possibility of recruiting them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance of a great nobleman is indeed eye-catching. But Mr. Hudson, who is upright, is not the kind of person who sees profit and forgets righteousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a black hand, it will have to wait for the order to collapse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi still exists, and the rules of the game are still operating normally. Going to bully the declining nobles, once the news is spread, how can you hang around in the circle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a matter of a lifetime, Hudson will not lose the big because of the small. Even if he wanted to obtain the inheritance of the great nobles, he would wait until the later stages of the war before acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, there will be more down-and-out nobles, and they will not be as eye-catching as they are now. As long as the appearance of eating is not too ugly, it will not cause waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respected Earl of Hudson, the current patriarch of the Leboron family, Anthony sends you greetings!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the young man who was talking, he could not be more than twenty years old. At this age, one can imagine the pressure to take over the burden of revitalizing the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no time to sympathize. No matter how desolate the Liboron family is, it is still a skinny camel that is bigger than a horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they lost their roots, their remaining strength is stronger than 99% of the minor nobles, and even surpassed some of the middle nobles at the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not yet qualified to sympathize with such a broken house. The current Koslow family would not be as good as others without his support!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Welcome Sir Anthony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have been friends with the Liboron family for a long time, and Prim's name is even more famous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he planned to visit Earl Langton and pay his respects to the relics of the Holy Fa. Unfortunately, the sky failed, and the city of Bethel suddenly encountered catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all those nasty orcs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such **** enmity, sooner or later we will end with them. It's really hard to get rid of the hatred in my heart if I don't wipe the orc empire from the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, Sir Anthony rarely came to visit today, so I will not mention these sad topics for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all because the subordinates are ignorant and have neglected the distinguished guests. I am really sorry!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom, send orders down for Sir Anthony's lodgings. One should be treated according to the earl's etiquette. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the loud noise in Bethel City, Hudson also made up his homework and studied the history of the Liboron family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to combine self-explosive magic arrays in series to create an explosion that is more powerful than most forbidden spells is definitely not something that ordinary people can accomplish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, the target was locked on Prim Fasheng, the first Patriarch. (9)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This legendary Dharma Saint was once famous in the mainland. Even if it is not in a country, it is mentioned in the materials of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how awesome a character is, it will be difficult to resist the erosion of time. After more than a hundred years of glory, the old Pharaoh, who was nearly 300 years old, went to meet the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ancestors are too powerful, and the younger generations live in the shadow of the ancestors, so it is always difficult to produce outstanding talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liboron family, which has no legendary saints, soon began to decline. In less than ten years, he fell from the principality's first family, and then fell all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of Earl Langton, although the strength of the Leboron family was still able to rank in the top five among the nobles of the Principality of Moxi, they were reduced to an ordinary noble and no longer had the detached status of the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson doesn't like to discuss history, after all, he doesn't have a prominent ancestor to show off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has been able to inherit for thousands of years, purely because of the large number of births. The direct line is destroyed, and there are collateral branches to top it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that can prove a long history is Koslow's surname. As for the family inheritance, I don't know how many times it was lost along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Fasheng is being touted so much now, purely because the current situation of the Liberon family is very embarrassing. Except for the illustrious ancestors, there is nothing to brag about at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Earl Langton can also be boasted, he generously sacrificed for the righteousness of the human race and severely damaged the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson's EQ is not that low. No matter how they boasted, the Bethel Fortress fell, and the Principality of Moxi fell into a strategic passive position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, a large part of the current embarrassing situation of the Liboron family is: the fall of the Bethel Fortress, which led to the sequelae caused by the passive strategy of the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragic hero is worthy of praise, but unfortunately, in order to fulfill the lord's duty, the number of noble lords who died in the Principality of Moxi exceeded three digits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everyone regards sacrifice as an obligation, this kind of thing is no longer commendable, and realistic nobles pay more attention to practical results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the source is, the Leboron family has to be responsible for the passive strategy of the Principality of Mosi, at least part of the responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Langton refused to let them go to the capital. Of course, he was not optimistic about the Principality of Moxi, but also worried that they would be pushed as scapegoats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those stationed at the Bethel fortress are not only the private army of the Liboron family, but also the private army of the small and medium-sized nobles nearby, as well as the reinforcements sent by the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the entire army of nobles guarding the city has been wiped out, they are the only ones who have escaped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that there is no time to say anything, and the Leibolong family has already drawn a lot of hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is no need to trouble yourself. This is all Anthony's fault. He suddenly encountered a catastrophe that day, and he concealed his identity out of desperation. It was really a last resort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I came to visit today, mainly to thank His Excellency the Earl for saving his life. If Your Excellency hadn't dispatched troops in time, my Leboron family might have disappeared. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony said gratefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just grateful, mixed with a trace of fear. Obviously frightened by Hudson's enthusiasm, according to the prior analysis, he was ready to suffer cold reception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson's enthusiastic performance, as if the two families are family friends, really made Anthony unable to understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Anthony took out a parchment and a photo stone, and handed them directly to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this is the refining formula of the life essence and the introduction of the refining method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Liboron family has encountered a catastrophe, and there is really nothing to repay for your life-saving grace. I can only offer a formula to express my heart. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Anthony also did his homework this time. After inquiring in advance, what is the Koslow family lacking now, can they give targeted gifts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such knowledge of human affairs and sophistication is obviously not possessed by a young man, and most of them are explained by the elders in the clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the parchment and the photo stone, Hudson shook his head, pushed them back, and said solemnly: \"Sir Anthony, you are welcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Helping those in danger and those in need is the quality that knights of our generation should have, not to mention fighting the orcs is the common duty of all races, how can we be greedy for rewards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life stock solution is priceless, if in a peaceful age, such remuneration would be enough to compensate for the grace of saving lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is the time of war, and the life essence, which was regarded as a treasure by everyone, is no longer so unattainable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long ago, the Moxi Principality offered him the conditions for recruiting him, which included the formula of life essence. As long as Hudson is willing to bring his tribe to develop, he can get it immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Chris IX's bid is indeed generous enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the life essence, but also a solidly sealed super-large earldom, the area can catch up with more than half of the southeastern provinces, and even the principality is willing to pay for the reconstruction costs after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is the location of the territory, which is a little bit worse than \"billion\". It just happened to fall outside the line of defense of Fort Augustus that had already fallen, and it was the first line to properly resist the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much he has, Hudson knows very well. Not to mention the fiefdoms of most of the provinces, even if Chris IX allocated all the northern regions to him, it would not be able to stop the orcs' advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is still young and does not want to die young. According to past experience, encountering the second or third full-scale orc invasion in one's lifetime is a high probability event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being neighbors with orcs is not only dangerous in times of all-out war, but also in peaceful times, orc tribes often come to fight the autumn wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost impossible to farm with peace of mind. All the aristocratic territories that were close to the orcs had poor production development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even setting aside the threat of the orcs, the north after the war is still an uninhabited land, and restoring the population is a huge problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality promised by Chris IX will provide post-war reconstruction expenses, just listen to the story. After this war, the treasury of the Principality of Moxi will cry if a mouse sees it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is very experienced in this regard, and every time the orcs are driven away, the whole country is exhausted. The central government has to ask for alms everywhere in order to be able to barely maintain its operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gift couldn't be delivered, and Anthony's cold sweat was about to break out. They are all mixed in the aristocratic circle, and everyone knows what this means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we sincerely want to thank you for your life-saving grace, please give us a chance to show it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have any requirements, you can just put them forward. As long as my Liboron family can do it, you will not be disappointed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony said tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Life and death are in the hands of others, this feeling is not good at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanking you for saving your life is just an excuse on the surface. The real purpose of his coming this time is to gain freedom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as you show your aristocratic status, the charge of entering and leaving the war zone without authorization will no longer exist, and you can leave Flying Bear Castle directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the opposite is true. As the commander of the front line, Hudson has a lot of power in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the boss is not dealt with, if he dares to say goodbye and leave, the call-up order will come down immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as the heir to the earl, Anthony himself does not need to worry about being forcibly conscripted into the army, but other members of the Liboron family cannot escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too simple to kill people on the battlefield. Anthony really didn't dare to bet on Hudson's integrity, so he simply had a showdown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Sir Anthony, I have no interest in your family treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should have heard that I am a magician. Like all magicians, I am also full of curiosity about the unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is convenient, I would like to borrow some books from the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic, alchemy, mainland secrets, ancient legends... I am more interested in all kinds of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sir, you can rest assured that I will keep the secrets of nobles strictly confidential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war is over, I will return to the Alpha Kingdom. This knowledge will also be taken away without any impact on the Liboron family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first time I see someone will covet inheritance, put it so elegantly. Anthony just felt that his brain was not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is that Hudson is only asking for knowledge, and has no idea about their family treasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance of great nobles usually has two parts, one part is pure knowledge inheritance, and the other part is the treasure of rebuilding the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Hudson, knowledge is definitely more important. But for Anthony, who is in urgent need of resources and rebuilding his family, knowledge can be copied and copied, but the treasure is the only one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small amount of family secrets, most of the knowledge of the Liboron family is not unique.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many noble families with this knowledge in the whole continent, and adding another owner will not have much impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson is not in the Principality of Moxi, and the two families are separated by thousands of miles. The possibility of conflict between the two parties is infinitely zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, with the friendship between our two families, I shouldn't have refused to borrow books.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But because of the war, most of the books of the Leiboron family were not brought out. Although the family has a backup outside, it is not in my hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So if you want to watch it, you have to live some days. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anthony said with a complicated expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't refuse, you can only accept the reality. Deep down in his heart, he could only comfort himself constantly: It is not a loss for the survival of the Leiboron family to exchange for the inheritance of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, the Jazz only need to lend me what they have. The rest just need to be delivered to me within three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding. We'd better sign a treaty of friendship, and everyone in House Liboron in the city must sign it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Use the gentlest tone and say the harshest words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Antony's complexion changed drastically in an instant. Originally, I just wanted to use some common knowledge to fill in the numbers and fool around. The appearance of the contract completely dispelled his luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the densely packed small characters on the parchment that suddenly appeared, Anthony couldn't help cursing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The content is too detailed, and all the binding clauses are aimed at them. The penalty for breach of contract is very simple, it is to take away their souls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Paying the family inheritance, the only gain is the friendship of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the specific content of friendship, there is nothing in the contract document anyway. The right of specific interpretation obviously belongs to Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one who just wanted to raise an objection just glanced at Hudson's half-smile expression, and Anthony instantly dispelled this terrible idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some unknown reason, he couldn't help but think back to the war a few days ago. Hudson's expression when he shot and killed General Beamon was very similar to now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    coincide?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He prefers to believe that this is a silent warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, a voice kept telling him that if he refused to sign the contract now, he would not be here the next time we meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bite the bullet and sign his name on the parchment, and in an instant Anthony felt a little more restraint on his soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Anyway, this part of the content is vacant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the extraordinary world pays attention to cultivation, but if you blindly lean towards this, it will be too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A big noble family is really powerful because of its comprehensive strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are obvious shortcomings in the military, which is not difficult to explain why the Bethel Fortress fell so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without emotion, Hudson has been immersed in the ocean of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, an army of orcs was found fifty miles ahead, and the number is as many as tens of thousands.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the orc army, Crown Prince Caesar suddenly became energetic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fifty miles is not close, nor is it far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the infantry is on the road with luggage, it may not be able to finish the journey in a day; if it is replaced by the cavalry, it will take more than an hour to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only at this distance that the enemy was discovered. It was really not that the Griffon cavalry were passive and sabotage. In fact, the farther the detection distance is, the larger the space that needs to be investigated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without knowing the enemy's position, searching for fifty miles is equivalent to drawing an arc with a radius of fifty miles along the position of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Monitoring such a large area, even if the Griffon Cavalry is flying in the sky, there is still a lot of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the orcs also have an air force. In case of an encounter with the patrolling Eagles, it is unknown whether they can come back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Order the Griffin Cavalry to continue to monitor the movement of the orcs, and find out the enemy's arms configuration as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, notify the army commanders to come over for a meeting! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has no experience in fighting with soldiers, he is still very proficient in basic military knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the familiar map, he knew that his previous judgment was correct. Sure enough, the orcs did not slam along the line of defense, but aimed at Da Paesi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar suddenly hesitated whether to stop moving forward and implement the previous fishing plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fall of Bethel Fortress cleared the way for the orc army to go south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to hunt down the orc army going south, the most important part is that someone must cut off the passage in the middle, so that the orc army that suddenly came in becomes a lone army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army in the rear is not an idiot, and they will definitely not let this kind of thing happen. The two sides are bound to compete around the Bethel area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moxi's army on the front line can complete this task?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar had no idea. Since the fall of Bethel Fortress, his assessment of the combat power of Moxi's army has plummeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the depths of his heart, he doubted more than once that the level of the Principality of Moxi is so good, so why did it become the first principality of the human race?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest advantage of having fewer people is high efficiency. The high-level expeditionary force composed of the commander, deputy commander and five army commanders quickly got together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The latest information about the orc army has also been passed on. The enemy's strength has changed from tens of thousands at the beginning to tens of thousands, to be exact, 30,000 to 50,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number of people, then don't make it difficult to scout the cavalry. The orcs marched chaotically, and it was possible to estimate a rough number, all of whom were veterans with rich experience in scouting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The range of the interval is a little bit larger, because the people below are serious and responsible for their work, and they are afraid of misleading the commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, our marching route is about to change. Continue to follow the same path, and we will soon collide with this orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary orc army is nothing to worry about, the key is that according to the detected information, there are still a large number of Beamon cavalry in the enemy army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although our army has the upper hand in terms of strength, we may not be able to take advantage of the Beamon cavalry in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the war comes to a stalemate, and the troops of the other four orc royal families come to reinforce, it will be a big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose said cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the deputy commander of the expeditionary force, his most important task is not to make contributions, but to bring the Crown Prince Caesar back safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most orthodox heir of the Alpha Kingdom, the value of Crown Prince Caesar's safe return is more important than any achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As guest soldiers, they are only here to help the scene, and there is no need to work too hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to his original intention, Crown Prince Caesar can stay in the rear and coordinate remotely. It would be perfect for the frontline affairs to be given free rein to several legion commanders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win a battle, the commander will be indispensable for military merit; if you lose, whoever commanded it will naturally be responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you are too cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families of the orcs act independently, and the Beamon family has always been used to being strong. If there is a chance to see them unlucky, it is too late for all the clans to be happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they reach a compromise and actually send troops to rescue, they will be passive and sabotage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, there are only two legions of the Beamon army entering the Principality of Moxi, and they have to guard against the frontline defenders cutting off the back. The most they can send is one legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some time ago, there were several wars, and the two legions are now full of members, at most eight or nine thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the expeditionary force of the Principality of Orton is only 20 miles away from us; the expeditionary force of the Earl of Ruilin is only more than 30 miles away from us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the strength of our three families, we have an army of 120,000. In addition to several newly formed legions of the Principality of Moxi, the total strength is more than 180,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are 50,000 orcs in the army ahead, it is enough to eliminate more than 40,000 miscellaneous soldiers from the Beamon clan and hand them over to the new army of the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrating the 120,000 expeditionary troops of the three countries, even if they can't swallow 8,000 or 9,000 Bimon cavalry, at least half of them can be kept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of the Beamon Royal Court was severely damaged, leaving only the troops of the other four imperial courts. The difficulty of encircling and annihilating the remaining four imperial courts was greatly reduced. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar analyzed calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cannon fodder versus cannon fodder, elite versus elite, there is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force is not all elite, but the proportion of elite soldiers still exceeds 20%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining soldiers, at worst, have received one year of military training. Although this training is a little watery, there are still several months of off-the-job training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is the team that accompanied him on the battlefield, and the nobles still worked hard in training. If it is not trained, it is purely a matter of ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the expedition, several legion commanders were trying to find ways to help their subordinates make up lessons. After all, a long-distance march is also a kind of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only tests the physical strength and endurance of soldiers, but also tests the organizational, coordination and cooperation abilities of an army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not known what happened to the expeditionary forces of the other two countries. But in Caesar's view, no matter how low it is, it will not be too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is going abroad to fight. There are many countries watching. If the strength is too poor, wouldn't it be embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength advantage of more than ten times is all on the Beamon cavalry. No matter how good they are at fighting, they will be dragged down and exhausted to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach and the deputy commander disagreed, and the five legion leaders present also fell into a state of disagreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people have no confidence in the expeditionary force, and they have no idea about the plan of Crown Prince Caesar; some people think that this battle can be fought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the power of role models is infinite. Not long ago, the news that the First Legion easily wiped out the Beamon Cavalry Regiment really stimulated many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a county soldier, and the Moxi people regard the First Army as a first-class elite, but they, the insiders, know it very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the First Legion is indeed superior to them, but if it is said to be too strong, they don't agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least among the main legions of the Alpha Kingdom, there is no First Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is as powerful as rumored by the outside world, the Kingdom would not be willing to send it to the Principality of Moxi as a consumable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An army slightly stronger than them can kill a Bimon cavalry regiment. Many people think that if they are replaced, there will be more casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't wipe it out, you can always injure the enemy, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three optimists + Crown Prince Caesar, the main combat faction suppressed the moderate faction with an absolute advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose wanted to object several times, but under the sharp eyes of Crown Prince Caesar, he finally chose to shut up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is just a part-time worker, nominally the deputy commander of the expeditionary force with high authority, but in fact, anyone present has more weight than his words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two Moderate Legion Leaders who placed high hopes on them did not have enough confidence in themselves, so they could not become strong in front of Crown Prince Caesar. After a few symbolic arguments, he immediately disarmed and surrendered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the dust had settled, Count Jose could only sigh secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't stop this war, you can only do your best to do a good job in order to improve the odds of winning the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, since we have decided to fight the orcs, we must coordinate the work of the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves joint operations of the armies of the four countries. It is best for everyone to concentrate their forces before acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if there is a problem in any link in the middle, the cooperation may not be in place, which will lead to the failure of the war! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he himself didn't notice how strong the disgust in Crown Prince Caesar's heart was when he mentioned \"failure\" one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The issue of coordinating the countries is left to the earl. Please be sure to handle the relationship with the three countries well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone else is going to prepare for battle, we are here waiting for the arrival of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The critical moment to reverse the situation of the battle has come, next...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Jose didn't listen to a word of the **** words, and his mind was full of the little shoes he was wearing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coordinating the relationship between countries is easy to say, but it will be terrible if it is implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is not affiliated with each other, so why should they listen to Caesar's command?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not enough interests, and the status of the crown prince of King Alpha is not worth everyone's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing more than a downwind battle. If there is a headwind, it will be a catastrophe and they will fly separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon Legion was exposed to the sight of the Alpha Kingdom army, and the expeditionary force was also exposed to the sight of the Beamon Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is limited to the chronological issue of discovering each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Prince Butzweig received the news, the distance between the two sides had already narrowed to forty miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing an enemy army far superior in strength to his own, Prince Butzweig also had no idea whether to fight a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Behemoth family claims to be invincible, it is just a boast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to scare the enemy, but if you take it seriously, it will be a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core factor in deciding whether to start a war is not only whether it can be won, but also how much it will cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon clan's reputation of being invincible in field battles is half due to real swords and guns, and the other half is good at choosing fighters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the enemy is strong and we are weak, but still rushing forward foolishly, that is not fighting, but killing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you sure it's the expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom, not the new army of the Mosi people?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all human armies, and their combat effectiveness is not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the battle has progressed, the orc empire also has its own set of standards for dividing the fighting power of the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the armies of the three northern countries, the armies of the Alpha Kingdom are not necessarily the most powerful, but they must be the most difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As centuries-old rivals, both sides know each other too well. The advantages and disadvantages of each are clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since we understand this well, targeted measures will naturally be developed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the private army of veteran aristocrats, which has been passed down from generation to generation, and many details are subtly engraved in their bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with these targeting methods, the Orc Empire did not think about changing. It's a pity that some racial talents and habits can't be changed if they want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulty does not mean invincibility, even if the opponent's weakness is discovered, it is only relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the absolute strength gap, the army of the Alpha Kingdom is still a beaten role, the only difference is that it can last for a while longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The estrangement between races has led to opaque intelligence on both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the strength of the Alpha Kingdom's Expeditionary Army. I only use the strength shown by the First Army as a reference, and Prince Butzweig has to pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, it is indeed the expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom. Even if the flags can be disguised, the respective characteristics of the two armies cannot be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy army in front is very similar to the Wrightshire Army we are concerned about. The only difference is that their formation is more chaotic, and there is no evil spirit that can be felt from a distance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Got the exact answer, Prince Butzweig is mixed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cannon fodder under his command can't be counted on. To eat up the enemy army far surpassing himself, a Beamon army alone is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good thing is that the enemy does not seem to be as strong as expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of cold weapons, there are many factors to consider in order to judge whether an army is elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is very simple to make sure it is not an elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No soaring evil spirit means that no blood has been seen. No matter how well trained this kind of army is, it cannot be called elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Prince Butzweig decided to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fleeing without fighting is not the style of the Beamon clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, their goal is Dapes City, even if they want to avoid it, the enemy may not let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Satuk, you immediately go to the camp of the Silver Moon Wolf Clan and tell them...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally got it out\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After all, this line of defense was not built firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After staying in Terrance City, Hudson found more than one flaw. The seemingly tall and majestic city wall is unreasonably designed in many places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, a fortress with outstanding strategic significance should take into account various emergencies. If defects are found during the construction process, they should be corrected immediately, and there will be no design defects in the finished product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There can be problems in the design, so the quality of the project can also be imagined. The bean curd dregs project may not be possible, but Hudson doesn't believe how strong it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the precedent of the Augustsburg defense line, the orc army continued to push forward all the way, which is completely justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pushing the defense line horizontally, naturally also included the Flying Bear Castle he was stationed at. Seeing the changes in the orc army, Hudson was terrified, so he started the extreme mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that he was completely overthinking. The simultaneous mobilization of troops by the five imperial courts of the orcs was not for this pitiful line of defense at all, but for a greater strategic purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging only from the scale of the troops dispatched, Hudson judged at a glance that the goal of the orc army was the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Temporarily dodged a catastrophe, but Hudson was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc army pushes horizontally all the way step by step, with the old guy Marshal Hodge in charge, Terrence's defense line will be able to hold on for two or three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a well-prepared guard like him, it depends on whether the orcs are strong. If they are not allowed to stay as nail households, mobilizing heavy troops to attack can delay some days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few more months of preparation time, the reinforcements from the northern countries have rushed over, and the Principality of Moxi can fight another battle to defend Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning or losing is not important, the key is being able to delay time. As the first principality of the human race, if you work hard, you can keep it for a few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it is the beginning of August, and it will be next year when the defense of Dapez is over. The strategic task entrusted to them by the Kingdom has also been completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the orc army is moving like this, the defense of Dapez will start in advance. The Terence line of defense that the Moxi people painstakingly built was also directly reduced to a decoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that this broken line of defense is useless, it's mainly that it's useless if the strength is weak. If the strength of the Principality of Moxi was stronger, the division of the orc army would be the best time to counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the five royal families of the orcs, who are still fighting on their own, without uniting to act together, it is simply a godsend opportunity to defeat them one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many assumptions in reality. Even if the orc army puts its flaws in front of everyone, the Moxi people don't have that strength now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, by gathering domestic mobile forces and various reinforcements, there is still a chance to encircle and wipe out one or two orc armies in the middle of the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really possible to encircle and annihilate one or two orc armies, then the defense of Dapace will end early. The army of orcs is not foolish, knowing that there is danger, they still want to move forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it is only a theory after all. Commanding a large army in a battle is a test of organizational ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just integrating one's own army is enough, let alone coordinating the armies of neighboring countries to fight together. Whether anyone in the Principality of Moxi can do it, Hudson doesn't know, anyway, he can't do it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were people with that kind of organizational ability, the Moxi people would not be completely defeated on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson doesn't care much about how long the Principality of Moxi can last, but the strategic tasks assigned by the Kingdom must be completed as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the Principality of Moxi, the western front of the Alpha Kingdom is open, and the orc army can drive straight in at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in several western provinces are busy repairing fortifications, and it is difficult to build a solid line of defense in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city defenses are not strong enough, and there is no geographical advantage to rely on, so the two sides have to fight hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The odds are high, Hudson is completely uncertain. Anyway, he knew that once the Alpha Kingdom collapsed, the flames of war would soon spread to the southeastern provinces, and the mountain territories would also be doomed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the flames of war burn to one's own territory, or stay in the Principality of Moxi to help others fight the defense war, this multiple-choice question is easy to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is also a kind of fate that we accepted the mission to guard the Fort of Flying Bear together. We have been together for a while, and we are not considered outsiders now, so I will speak directly if I have something to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army has crossed the line of defense and is splitting into five routes to penetrate the hinterland of the principality. The final goal is likely to be the city of Dapace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know much about your country. I can't make an accurate judgment on whether Dapes City can block the orc army's front, or how long it can block it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is related to our future fate. I hope that the two of you can give an accurate judgment as possible based on what you have learned. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the truth, and there is too little information in his hands. He really doesn't know how long the defense of Dapez will last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is an extraordinary world. In addition to considering the strength of ordinary troops, the influence of extraordinary power factors must also be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps these powers are not enough to turn things around, but it is still possible to slow down the speed of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City has gathered a lot of old-fashioned nobles. Once these guys get ruthless, they are definitely not easy to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's hard to say how effective these hole cards can be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army suffered a loss in the Bethel Fortress once, so it must be prepared. If you want to design a second time, the difficulty is not at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the fortifications of Dapace are very complete. The Principality has also considered the risk of being besieged by orcs and made some preparations in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the Great War, the city defense army has expanded rapidly, and its current total strength is between 15,000 and 20,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palace guards guarding the king also expanded from the original 2,000 people to 3,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private army of the nobles can gather more than 10,000 people. In addition, the mercenary organization and chamber of commerce armed forces in the city totaled two to three thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are about seven or eight hundred magicians staying in the capital. All the tutors and some outstanding students of the Academy of Magic are members of the magician group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength varies from junior magician to grand magister. The details have been kept strictly confidential and unknown to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there are three newly formed legions near the capital, which are undergoing military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the king issues a call-up order, it is estimated that two new legions can be formed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest depends on how much preparation time the orcs leave for the Principality. The longer the delay, the stronger the defense force of Dapes City will be. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just analyzing the defensive strength of the capital, without mentioning how long the city of Pest can hold, it is obvious that Raquel still has some political savvy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can comment directly, because he is not in the Principality of Moxie. No matter how harsh the words are, no one can do anything to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a local nobleman, Viscount Raquel can't talk nonsense. If it is accidentally spread and falls into the hands of one's political opponents, it will be a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount William on the side didn't say a word, just nodded in agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The positions of the two are surprisingly consistent, that is, tell Hudson what he knows, and let him, an outsider, make this judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson read the answer he wanted from the sad expressions of the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat effectiveness of the city defense army was mediocre, but the combat effectiveness of the expanded city defense army was even more broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palace guard is a proper super elite. As the force to protect the king, the threshold for joining is there. At the end of the day, you have to be a knight to be eligible to sign up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after the expansion, it is estimated that the combat effectiveness will not drop too much. The number of expansions is stuck there, and it is unlikely that there will be blind recruitment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble private army should be mostly elite. The existence of the housekeeper and nursing home does not have any cultivation base, so I am afraid that it will not be able to deter the brave thieves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chamber of Commerce mercenary organization, the strength of these people is very polarized, there are strong and weak. Don't have too many extravagant expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only surprise is the group of magicians. I originally thought that most of the magicians had gone to the front line, but I didn't expect that there were so many left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But thinking of the Academy of Magic, Hudson understood again. Maybe most of the current magician group is in the academy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little calculation of the number of magicians in the Principality of Moxi, Hudson found that he was miserably deceived by the official data.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is definitely more than just a few magicians on the surface. The exact number is not clear, but at least it will not be less than the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of the last newly formed legion is indeed quite large, but unfortunately their fighting power is too touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After gathering all the forces together, Hudson became more and more disfavored about the Principality of Moxie. For no other reason, there are really few elites in the capital!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the initiative to attack, there is no need to fantasize at all. The strength gap between the two sides is too great, and no one can say for how long Dapes City will be able to hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the two of them, Hudson said with a heavy heart: \"I see. Next, hurry up and train the army with your heart!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much time left for us. No matter how long the king can hold on, we must be prepared for a protracted war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king is gone, but the city still has to be defended. Even if you want to run away, it is definitely not this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you leave the protection of the city wall and encounter the main force of the orc army in the wild, you are giving the enemy a head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think that the 40,000 to 50,000 troops assembled in Flying Bear's Castle can be used to fight the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a fight, only the Wrightshire Army led by him can be used, and the rest can only follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the headwinds, even a little more stalemate may collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is so bad, the only thing to be thankful for is that he has the foresight. The bureaucrats of the logistics department were urged early on to send the things over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is delayed until now, even if the bureaucrats are willing to send things over, they will not be able to do it. Once the city of Da Pest is besieged, everything can only be left alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, the news that the orc army broke through the barrier was passed on early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance in the middle is just that little, and it only takes a few days for the orc army to approach the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I was prepared, this day really came. All the high-level officials of the Principality of Moxi were still in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crown Prince Caesar sent a message to prepare to unite the Principality of Orton, the Earl of Ruilin, and us, and combine the strength of the four families to encircle and wipe out the army of the Bimon Royal Court on the way, and cut off the enemy's arm first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the plan is successful, the offensive and defensive momentum will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc army refuses to retreat, we can grind them to death as long as we grind them slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What do you think is the odds of this victory? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This plan sounds really good. If it is really possible to encircle and annihilate the army of the Bimon Royal Court, it will also be a deterrent to other orc armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The siege of Dapace was lifted before it appeared. Without the participation of the Beamon clan, the expeditionary forces of the other four clans would not have an absolute advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the advantage of the home field, they can be driven out by only bringing reinforcements from the northern countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the key to this battle plan is whether or not the Beamon cavalry can be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly formed legions of the principality can only entangle with the ordinary orc army at most, and they may collapse at the first touch when they encounter the elite Beamon. It mainly depends on the strength of the three allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dukedom of Orton and the Earl of Ruilin have enjoyed peace for many years, and the troops sent over may be useless. The only thing that can be counted on is the expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they all have the strength of their First Army Corps, it will not be difficult to implement the encirclement and annihilation plan. From what we know, it's probably not possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alfa Kingdom sent out an elite army, and the rest were ordinary troops. The combat power should be slightly stronger than the general army of the principality, but not too much stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the last five legions of the expeditionary force had half the fighting power of the First Legion, we would not lose this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the coalition forces have a superior force and are stronger than the Mongolian cavalry. If there is a fight, it still depends on the military command of the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this war, the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force will be the absolute main force, and our three countries will all be auxiliary. Since Crown Prince Caesar dared to propose this plan at this time, he should be very confident. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg analyzed seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the data on paper, the coalition forces have an advantage anyway. The only trouble is that there is only one Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to wipe them out, it is difficult to do it without ten times the strength. But now they don't need to do it so thoroughly, they just need to defeat the Beamon cavalry, and the difficulty has dropped by more than one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, your estimate may be too optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The First Legion of the Expeditionary Army is just an example. Even among the main armies of the Alpha Kingdom, their strength should be ranked high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to obtaining a large amount of magic equipment from us, the combat effectiveness has been further improved, and only now is the current strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the normal army of the Alpha Kingdom can have half of their combat effectiveness, I am afraid that the Alpha Kingdom will have a decisive battle with the Orc Empire as soon as the battle begins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Optimistically, the five legions behind the expeditionary force are equivalent to two first legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I personally prefer the strength of their five legions, which is only equivalent to 1.5 of the first legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the command is proper, it is indeed possible to defeat the undersized Beamon army, but this requires very high personal abilities of the commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sorry, I don't think Crown Prince Caesar has the military command ability. If he is willing to give up the military command and hand it over to an experienced general, he may be able to complete the battle plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins shrugged and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he obviously knows more information. It is precisely because he knows so much that he is not optimistic about this battle plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For no other reason, the difficulty of coordinating the joint operations of the armies of the four countries is so great that it is almost an impossible task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes allies can not only help, but also help. Once there is a problem with coordination, it is almost inevitable to be pitted by allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, it was a joint operation of the four countries, but if it was not done well, it would become a **** battle between one or two of them and the Beamon army, and the other allies were responsible for holding back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of delay is not their subjective will. Pure strength does not allow them to keep a low profile, they can only cheat their teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is unrealistic for Crown Prince Caesar to give up his command. He is a guest army, and we have no right to interfere at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make such a request, you will completely offend people. In any case, Crown Prince Caesar's active combat attitude is worthy of recognition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military command ability, no one can tell without verification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throughout the ages, it is not uncommon for famous generals who were born as playboys. What's more, the performance of Crown Prince Caesar is better than these people before they became famous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the careful training of the royal family of King Alpha, the military theoretical foundation of Crown Prince Caesar is still very solid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the military talent is not very good, as long as the theoretical foundation is solid enough and no big mistakes are made on the battlefield, the problem is not big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Alpha Kingdom also equipped him with an experienced deputy commander in military command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, that Earl Jose has not only served in the standing army for many years, but has also participated in the formulation of the Alpha Kingdom's strategy many times.

The aristocrats who came from the Alpha Kingdom were investigated one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato knew all the amazing performances. Earl Jose, who had a good resume, naturally came into his sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of ministers expressed their opinions one after another, and everyone's opinions were surprisingly close. They almost overwhelmingly supported the plan of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attitude of the ministers also affected King Chris IX.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Martins, do you have any other reasons for opposing this campaign?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, I think you have made a mistake. I just object to being commanded by Crown Prince Caesar, and I do not reject launching this campaign.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the principality, as everyone said, we must take a gamble now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it succeeds, the decadent trend since the war will be reversed; if it fails, the situation will not be much worse!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personally, I suggest that it is best for the illustrious Earl of Hudson to take over the military command of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only because of his outstanding record, but mainly because of his better luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A baron's second son, he got to his current position in just a few years, and he didn't experience twists and turns in the middle. He is simply the template of the legendary epic hero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality needs luck. I think it should be the best choice to hand over the battle that will determine the fate of the country to a general who is lucky and has an outstanding record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coincidentally, the Earl of Hudson is also the general of the Alpha Kingdom. With him taking over the military command of the expeditionary force, the internal resistance should not be too great. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After the cryptic proposal was rejected, Crown Prince Caesar became the supreme commander of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to take on such an important task, the Crown Prince Caesar is not a military rookie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of leading the army foolishly to chase the Beamon army for a decisive battle, they set up camp on the spot and blocked their way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the decisive battle of the large corps, the simpler the strategic deployment, the easier it is to exert its effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A fancy plan will lift a rock and hit itself in the foot most of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force, together with the new army of the Principality of Moxi, deployed their defenses on the spot under the arrangement of Crown Prince Caesar, waiting for the orc army to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuously patrolling the defense of the camp, the seemingly high-spirited Crown Prince Caesar was not as relaxed as he appeared on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theory is just theory after all, and there are still many deviations in implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the five major legions of the Expeditionary Army is generally unsatisfactory; the newly formed legion of the Mosi people is simply impossible to watch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of combat experience is a common problem in these armies. From the commander to the bottom soldiers, none of them have participated in a large corps battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Earl Jose's assistance, he would have almost collapsed due to internal coordination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After twists and turns, the formation of troops was finally completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar had no idea about encircling and annihilating the Beamon Legion. For no other reason than the sheer lack of cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force only had more than 3,000 cavalry, and the three newly formed regiments of the Mosi had only 800 cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of cavalry is less than half of that of Beamon's cavalry. If there is a head-on confrontation, I am afraid that one charge will be directly defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the number of cavalry unreasonable, but the combination of other arms does not meet the requirements in the military book.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the new regiment of the Mosi people, there is no heavy infantry at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't know the importance of heavy infantry, it's that the formation time of these armies is too short. Many people were still serfs with hoes two or three months ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having only had enough food for two or three months, their physical fitness simply does not allow them to become heavy infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is so much bad news, but it is not without good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least according to further investigation, it was found that the number of orc army on the opposite side was slightly less than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total force is less than 40,000, of which the Beamon cavalry is only in the early 8,000s. It is basically certain that the cavalry regiment was wiped out by the First Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both belong to the Beamon Legion, and there is also a gap in strength within them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared to the ordinary human army, even the Beamon Army with the most combat effectiveness is ridiculously strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to wipe out a cavalry regiment by the First Legion proves that the combat effectiveness of this Beamon Legion should be at the bottom of all Beamon Legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on this judgment, it gave Crown Prince Caesar enough confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the first round of attack of the orc army is blocked, the next step is to counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the allied armies moving on the two wings will press up together, which will be the end of this orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early in the morning, Dietrich had just woken up from his sleep, and just as he ordered a fire to cook, the shouts of killing sounded from the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Dietrich could react, there was chaos in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs came so fast. They were still more than forty miles away yesterday. It was really unexpected to come here early in the morning to steal the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horse rejection posts, horse pits, and various roadblocks all seemed futile in front of the Beamon cavalry and did not play any role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Brigade of Beamon cavalry rushed into the camp of the Expeditionary Army of the Earl of Ruilin, and the **** massacre began without saying a word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many soldiers had just climbed out of their tents, and before they had time to put on their armor, they greeted the spears of the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of Ruilin, who had lived in peace for countless years, had never seen such a battle before, and they panicked instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Counterattack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Organize a counterattack for me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dietrich almost roared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a small country, the family background of the Earl of Ruilin is not solid. For this rescue, they also spent a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A legion that had been painstakingly formed received this blow in the face of the principality of Moxi without making any achievements. Dietrich's heart was broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a group of officers who were more broken than his heart. The boss ordered to organize a counterattack, but how should we counterattack?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the expeditionary military of the Earl of Ruilin has not conducted any drills in this area before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some nobles with family backgrounds have learned relevant theoretical knowledge, but that is only in theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small number of officers organized private troops to intercept the Beamon cavalry in an attempt to stabilize their position. Unfortunately, they all overestimated their own strength and underestimated the enemy's strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost face to face, the soldiers who stepped forward to intercept were easily penetrated by the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry who lost their organizational strength can only be slaughtered at the gunpoint of the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle was still going on, and countless defeated soldiers from the Earl of Ruilin had left the camp and fled in all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the situation was over, all Dietrich could do was light the smoke and ask for help from nearby allied troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Together with the smoke, there is the Orton Expeditionary Army camp on the other side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As \"bad brothers and bad brothers\", the orc army did not forget to launch a sneak attack on them while attacking the expeditionary army of the Earl of Ruilin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the one-sided Ruilin army, the performance of the Duke of Orton's expeditionary force was slightly better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the gift of the king, the nobles of the Principality of Orton generally have higher subjective initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coach Raimondo has a good habit of getting up early for morning exercises, and even the officers and soldiers have also developed a good habit of getting up early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defense of the camp was also insufficient, Shengzai discovered the Bimon cavalry a little earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course it was early, and the enemy was only discovered a few miles in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the sentry sent out, it is not necessary to think about it and know that they did not send back the information in advance. They must have met the Lord of Dawn in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also uncertain. The Beamon cavalry galloped faster than most war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they discovered their movements a few miles in advance, they estimated that when the scouts ran back, the enemy would follow them into the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to set off beacon smoke as a warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky has just turned bright and the fog has not yet dissipated in the early morning, which greatly affects the sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a little more preparation time, most of the soldiers of the Principality of Orton put on their armor and took up their weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the time is still too short, and there is no time to form troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, with their reaction speed, even if the Beamon cavalry started preparations as soon as they set off, they would not be able to complete the formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Raymond was leading the battle while sinking into deep self-blame and annoyance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the camp was built stronger and more traps were placed outside the camp for the Beamon cavalry, they would not be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by inexperience. If the human cavalry is intercepted, these preparations are sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Behemoth Behemoths are much stronger than war horses, and some small traps are simply fishing for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the rising call for help, Crown Prince Caesar's heart collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs played cards completely against common sense!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving his camp in the center not to attack, he actually divided up his troops to attack the allies on the two wings. He didn't talk about martial arts at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are sworn enemies, condemnation is meaningless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being scolded by the enemy is itself a kind of compliment. The harder you scold, the more fun the orc will do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many Beamon cavalry are going out? How far has the situation deteriorated?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance between the two camps was only the last ten miles. The Beamon cavalry left early in the morning, so naturally they couldn't hide it from the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the Allied camp that was attacked was not far away. At the same time as the news came back, the beacon for help was also ignited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Judging from the movement, the Beamon clan dispatched about four to five thousand cavalry, and the troops were divided into two groups to launch a sneak attack at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news that the Griffin Cavalry just sent back, the expeditionary force of the Earl of Ruilin has begun to collapse, and the expeditionary force of the Principality of Orton may not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the new army of the Mosi who acted with them, although they were not attacked by the Beamon army, they still fell into chaos. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose replied solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This answer undoubtedly hurt Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally agreed that everyone sent elites to support the Principality of Moxi, but they were all of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only four to five thousand Bimeng cavalry in total, and the troops have to be divided into two groups to act. On average, a legion faces only one cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the First Legion annihilated a Beamon cavalry regiment in front, everyone still vowed to clamor that I can do it, and Caesar really thought that both of them had sent elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no need for them to go out to encircle and wipe out the Beamon Cavalry Regiment, they just stick to the camp, and they were defeated by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is no longer a problem of lack of defense and encountering a sneak attack, but that one's own combat effectiveness is really not good enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is placed on the elite troops, even if they are attacked by Beamon cavalry, they can react quickly and drive the enemy out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ten times the strength of troops, even if it is a heap of human lives, it can also kill the Bimon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cavalry directly attacked the camp, which itself was a high-risk gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cases recorded in the history books are all the lucky ones who gambled successfully. More gambling losers disappear in obscurity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Very unfortunately, the Beamon Cavalry is now the winner. Their success does not lie in the control of fighters, it is simply that the opponents are too useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send troops to rescue?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea was born, it was decisively suppressed by Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politically, it is necessary to rescue allies, but military conditions do not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only so few cavalry in hand, send them out to rescue allies, maybe even yourself can get in together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staring at the map for a while, Crown Prince Caesar said cruelly: \"The battle on the two wings is not over so quickly, let our allies and Beamon cavalry play slowly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy separated the two wings, and this is the time when the camp is most empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order, and the whole army will attack the orc army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose was about to say something, but swallowed it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is indeed the best time for a decisive battle. Half of the Beamon cavalry rushed to attack the two wings, and the camp of the Chinese army must be empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary forces of the Earl of Ruilin and the Principality of Orton may not be very effective in combat, but they have a lot of troops\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the two new Moxi regiments operating together, the total strength is more than 60,000. Even if they can't beat the Beamon cavalry, they can consume a lot of physical strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consumed a lot of physical strength, even if the Beamon cavalry immediately ended the battle and returned to the main camp, they became tired soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how elite troops are, they can't stand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take a good rest, you will immediately throw yourself into a new battle. I am afraid that 100% of your combat power will only be able to exert 40% to 50% at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a good opportunity, if missed, it will be difficult to defeat the Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the camps of the two sides are separated by ten miles. It will take at least an hour to reach the battlefield by abandoning all the supplies and launching an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of the luggage, Earl Jose suddenly changed his face and said hastily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, if we attack the enemy's camp, their cavalry on the two wings may sneak attack on our camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food, grass and supplies are all in the camp. If the enemy cavalry succeeds, even if we win this battle, we will be in big trouble. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not just a big trouble, it's clearly killing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that food and supplies are lost, even with the cooperation of the Moxi people, it is regarded as a local battle, and it will not be able to gather the supplies for the army for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Acting hungry, the morale of the army can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army that came here this time is not just the Beamon family. If they encounter other orc royal army again, the consequences will be unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leave it to the new army of the Mosi people to guard it. They can't help in this war anyway, so they just stay and guard the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our camp is fairly strong. As long as their allies learn their lessons, it is not difficult to block the enemy cavalry from attacking the camp. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many cases of cavalry attacking the camp, but they are all based on the opponent's unpreparedness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no precedent for the kind of camp that has been prepared in advance and deployed its troops early, to be torn apart by cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that you can't rush in, the main reason is that the price you need to pay is too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the loss is too great in the process of attacking the camp, even if the camp is forcibly torn apart, the loss outweighs the gain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that with tens of thousands of expeditionary troops, a Beamon cavalry regiment can be replaced, Crown Prince Caesar will say without hesitation—change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the cannon fodder army is so worthless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous orc invasions, the number of troops killed in the Alpha Kingdom was in the millions. Ten rooms and nine empties are not enough, every family weeps bitterly, and every household hangs white sails, but this is a true portrayal of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been seen a lot in history books, and Caesar has long been insensitive to numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by an order, the expeditionary army stepped out of the camp in a mighty manner, and the soldiers pointed directly at the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the camp of the orc army, Prince Butzweig sneered as he watched the human army appearing from the horizon, \"It finally came out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order down, let the leaders of the tribes lead the army to attack freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how they fight, they must persist for an hour before retreating!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Satuk, send a message to our old friends, tell them the fish has come out and they can pull the net...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The expeditionary force, which has set up a full formation to attack, still has some combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the **** battle kicked off, the expeditionary army gained the dominance on the battlefield and directly suppressed the orc army with the tribe as the unit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig on the Beast, glanced at the battlefield indifferently, then withdrew his gaze and stopped paying attention, as if the one who was fighting was not his own subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalry, who were supposed to attack at this time to harass the flanks of the expeditionary army and share the pressure for their own army, had no intention of dispatching at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beamon's cavalry didn't move, and Crown Prince Caesar didn't dare to let his own cavalry move rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all old opponents. When the cavalry is at a disadvantage, how to fight against the Beamon cavalry, the Alpha Kingdom army also has its own way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cavalry can't fight head-on, then use the infantry on the side to provide fire cover. There is no need to rush up and fight the enemy desperately, as long as the cavalry exists is the greatest deterrent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to launch this campaign, and the expeditionary force is not completely unprepared. There are still some long-range weapons for the Beamon cavalry, but the number is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are a lot of things, the number of heaps does not necessarily need to be. The Beamon clan is sparsely populated, which means that the commanders of the Beamon people must cherish every soldier when fighting with soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human army can sacrifice thousands or even tens of thousands of cavalry in exchange for victory in a battle, but the Behemoths cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A battle with heavy casualties was a strategic failure for the Bimon family, no matter how brilliant the results were.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time passed by, and the orc army was beaten back steadily. The situation on the battlefield became more and more favorable to the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is about to collapse, and Crown Prince Caesar is overjoyed. If it weren't for good upbringing, he couldn't help laughing out loud.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that he didn't notice that as the army continued to advance, his formation became scattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On some battlefields, in order to better chase down orcs, they even voluntarily gave up their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Victory comes too easily, it is always easy to make people drift. As the orc army retreated steadily, the expeditionary force exposed more and more flaws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Silver Moon Wolf Clan Camp, one elite cavalry regiment and two ordinary wolf cavalry regiments are all ready to go, waiting for the order from Duke Daniel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the orc army closest to the Beamon camp, it is also the most mobile orc army. The allies are fighting hard at the moment, and it stands to reason that they should send reinforcements as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of coach Daniel Duke is very incomprehensible. If you want to say no reinforcements, you order all your subordinates to be ready to go; but if you want to send troops for reinforcements, the order has not been issued for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the five imperial courts of the orcs were full of internal conflicts, under the pressure of the human race, they have held together for countless years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the critical period of the war between the two clans, everyone came out together to carry out the task of capturing the city of Dapace. In a sense, cheating your allies is cheating yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are expensive on the battlefield, and if you delay a little on the road, you can make a small hole in the Beamon clan, and you can still find an excuse to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Delayed in taking action, just sat and watched the Behemoth army and the human race fight. If you accidentally overplay and let Beamon's army die, then there is no way to end it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is time to order the expedition.

After waiting here for two or three hours, the commander gave no order to attack. Everyone couldn't bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the expectant eyes of all his colleagues, as the head of the elite cavalry regiment, Thomas became the leader for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he finished speaking, he met Duke Daniel's sharp gaze, and he began to regret it secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the coach has a bad temper, he has always been used to saying the same thing, especially when it comes to military command, he can't tolerate other people's gossip, so he still wants to make fun of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Really, since you think it's time to go out now, then go out on your own!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cold voice fell in Thomas' ears like a thunderbolt from the blue. Recalling Duke Daniel's methods, his whole body began to tremble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you afraid of, you dare to teach me to do things. Thomas, what else are you afraid to do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel's half-smile was like pouring cold water on Thomas again, making him completely chilled from top to bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of the cold-faced Duke is very popular in the Orc Empire. This nickname is not only for being indifferent, but also for being killed with one knife and one gun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since his debut, Duke Daniel has presided over dozens of battles, no matter what kind of enemy he faces, without a single defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His sturdy record pushed him to the altar. In the Silver Moon Imperial Court, it has a pivotal position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only shortcoming is that he is too indifferent and ruthless. He likes to be arbitrary when fighting with soldiers. He likes to make up his own mind about everything and never listens to anyone's opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the indifferent eyes, there is a kind of inherent arrogance, as if he is the only smart person in this world, and everyone else is a foil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is also the case. Countless classic cases have finally proved that Duke Daniel is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such a coach, the generals don't need to think, they are all tool people who obey orders and are responsible for implementing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Remember, Thomas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are the head of the Cavalry Army of my Silver Moon Wolf Clan, not the head of the Cavalry Army of the Beamon Clan. The loss of the Behemoth family has nothing to do with you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Duke Daniel's warning, Thomas' cloudy face suddenly turned cloudy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This guy never talks nonsense with others, and if he is willing to mention him now, it means that he still has the value of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, His Excellency Duke, for your guidance, Thomas will definitely keep it in mind...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking his determination, Duke Daniel waved his hand and interrupted: \"Now we can go on an expedition, but it is not to rescue the Beamon army, but to go directly to the camp of the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a big camp, and the things in the human camp are not comparable to the poor ghosts of the Bimeng people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thomas, this task is entrusted to you. Take back all the supplies in the human camp, and rescue the Beamon army by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Prince Butzweig, you don't need to worry about it. The real army of the Beamon clan was on their way, and the tens of thousands of cannon fodder were originally the bait he had prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    invited us to act together, but the fish they caught was too big for them to swallow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all empty-headed calculations without any real value. Even if the plan is successful, we still have to compete with the human race in the end! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After learning the truth, Thomas' face changed drastically again. He never imagined in his dreams that the Beamon clan was so big that the tens of thousands of troops said they didn't want it and they didn't want it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminiscent of the fact that a Beamon cavalry regiment was wiped out before, he instantly understood that the Beamon family was retaliating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first legion of the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Army, the instigator, was nested in the Flying Bear Fortress and could not come out. The only way to avenge them was to storm the fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be done is one thing. The key is that the Orc Empire's current strategy is to take down the city of Dapace and destroy the Principality of Moxi as soon as possible. There is no time to waste in the tasteless Fort of Flying Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't find the right lord to take revenge, and it's the same with other expeditionary forces of the Alpha Kingdom. It can not only establish great achievements, but also tell the world with practical actions-the Beamon family should not be insulted!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements are still on the way, and the situation on the battlefield has become more and more obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeated orc army has retreated to the camp. If it weren't for the Beamon cavalry on the side supervising the battle, I'm afraid they would have been defeated long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements did not arrive on time, and the so-called retreat for an hour naturally became a picture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He couldn't do anything when he saw things. In addition to complaining about the unreliability of his allies deep in his heart, Prince Butzweig had to lead the Beamon cavalry to attack in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force without the protection of the formation is like a naked...waiting for them to go...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the Beamon cavalry rushed into the expeditionary army and launched a massacre of cavalry against infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar, who was still immersed in the joy of victory just now, was directly awakened by this basin of cold water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that Beamon cavalry is Beamon cavalry after all, even if the current strength is less than four thousand, it can pose enough threat to tens of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order is passed on, and all the cavalry will attack to restrain the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Order the commanders of each army to reorganize the formation of the troops under their command, and cooperate with the cavalry to encircle and wipe out this Beamon cavalry! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the order was issued, the three thousand cavalry who had been prepared for a long time immediately detoured to the rear of the Beamon cavalry at the fastest speed, and launched an attack on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The action of chasing and killing the rout of the orcs suddenly slowed down. Under the organization of noble officers, a huge encirclement slowly began to take shape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how brave and good at fighting, he is also afraid of crowd tactics. Although the battle just now consumed a lot of physical strength of the soldiers of the expeditionary army, it also boosted the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the unexpected panic, under the organization of noble officers, the expeditionary force quickly restored order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A hundred-man phalanx continued to appear on the battlefield, relying on the power of the formation to fight against the Mongolian cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cursed \"Damn\" secretly, although the expeditionary army was very immature, these phalanxes against the Beamon cavalry were very skilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is clear that this is the result that can only be obtained after countless rehearsals in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Prince Butzweig realized that he was careless. After all, the army of the Alpha Kingdom is different from the Mosi people. Even the ordinary army has not forgotten to train these methods against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the expeditionary army fails to be defeated in the first place, it is simply impossible to defeat an army twenty times that of one's own with the thousands of cavalry in hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the encirclement was completed, Prince Butzweig immediately ordered: \"Warriors of the Beamon tribe, follow me to charge and capture the enemy commander alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the order was issued, the Beamon cavalry, who fell into blind obedience, had a new target in an instant, and the soldiers pointed directly at the commander-in-chief of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, the enemy is going to make a last-ditch fight, why not retreat for a while, wait until the encirclement is locked, and then settle with them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose persuaded against his conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to take care of the face of Crown Prince Caesar, the Beamon cavalry were still alive and kicking on the field, and he insisted that they became a lone army that was about to be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the expeditionary army's encirclement in a decent manner, but the experienced Earl Jose saw the problem at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many phalanxes on the field, which seem to be able to divide and compress the activity space compared with the Mongolian cavalry, and finally implement encirclement and suppression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is a very big problem with the cooperation between these phalanxes. They did not complete the division of the Mongolian cavalry in the first time. Instead, they broke through the middle many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where several legions connect, problems occur frequently. Either a huge gap was left, or everyone collided, and no one could get out of formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any flaw, the Beamon cavalry can break out, and once again swim to the periphery of the battle circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now coming straight to Crown Prince Caesar, not just pretending, but really making a breakthrough. The soldiers who intercepted along the way were broken into three waves in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Crown Prince Caesar was hesitating about whether to get out of the way, thick smoke suddenly rose from the camp behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The camp is attacked by the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea came out, Crown Prince Caesar was happy instead of worried. The two Beamon cavalry that attacked the allies went to the camp, and the Beamon cavalry in front of them became a lone army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, don't worry. It's not that easy for the Beamon cavalry to come over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Second Army Corps has already stopped in front, and after they have broken through these dozens of interceptions, it will not be too late to consider taking shelter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order, order the troops to stop chasing the orc rout, and try their best to eat this Beamon cavalry...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could say the word \"bing\", he heard an urgent call from afar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, the griffin cavalry sent for investigation has not sent back a message for more than an hour and a half. The griffin cavalry sent again has also lost contact.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, a Beamon cavalry appeared 20 miles to the southwest, and they are rushing towards us.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, the army of the Silver Moon Wolf Royal Family is attacking the rear camp, and there are tens of thousands of wolf cavalry coming straight to our position, the distance is not more than...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another, the battle reports came together without giving Caesar any time to react, making his head buzzing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the news that the Griffin Cavalry had an accident, he knew that it was deliberately targeted by the enemy, and he was in big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But I didn't expect to encounter such a big trouble this time. In addition to the army of the Beamon Emperor's Court, the army of the Silver Moon Emperor's Court also participated in this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, orcs cannot be judged by common sense. The five imperial courts fight independently, and there is no rule that they must not cooperate with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to realize this when the war was burning to the brows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What puzzled Crown Prince Caesar was that he hadn't done anything before. This was his maiden battle since his debut, so why was he targeted by the orcs in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to keep the griffin cavalry he sent was not something that could be accomplished by three or five eagle men. In fact, most of the eagle soldiers were no match for the griffin cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can take them down are either the strong ones of the Eagle Clan or the superpowers of other orc royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire battlefield is like a big net, just to catch him as a fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Crown Prince Caesar wanted to cry. He is provoking someone, and he wants to target him like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think so much, after this battle, his dream of being a general will be completely shattered, and he will lose the opportunity to command the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in this battle, his performance was quite satisfactory and he did not make major mistakes, but the final result was still the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loser has no right to speak, even if he is the crown prince, there is no exception. Even with the title of head coach, the people below must be willing to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom need is a commander who can lead them to victory, not a distinguished crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, there is nothing to be done now, order the withdrawal of troops to preserve the vitality first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he already secretly regretted that he did not stop Crown Prince Caesar's arbitrariness and led the army into a dangerous place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Beamon cavalry in front of us couldn't take it down for a long time, and the enemy's reinforcements were about to come again. If we didn't run away quickly, it would be difficult to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitantly glanced at the battlefield, Crown Prince Caesar gritted his teeth and ordered: \"The second legion is in charge of the rear, and the rest follow me to retreat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a short distance, it is almost impossible for a two-legged person to run over four legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Second Legion is left behind, it will be very difficult to leave with a large army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as he thought of the tragedy of being chased and killed by enemy cavalry on the way to retreat, Crown Prince Caesar would worry secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary army was running, and the other side was storing food, grass, and supplies in the camp, and blood was flowing like a river at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp is indeed very strong, and the two new Moxi regiments are indeed working very hard to hold on to the camp, but their strength does not allow it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the sudden wolf cavalry, the recruits were directly confused. It was promised to guard against the Beamon cavalry stealing the camp, but why did they become wolf cavalry?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the wolf cavalry's long spear that answered their question. Taking advantage of the panic of the defenders, under the charge of the wolf death squad, they quickly tore a hole in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swarming wolf cavalry directly carried out the bloodiest massacre on the defenders. For a while, the ground was covered with corpses, and the world was stained red with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the **** massacre of the wolf cavalry, the defenders could only struggle in a pool of blood besides igniting the smoke of rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The panic continued to spread, even if the noble officers took the lead, they could not restore the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements were still missing, and more and more people felt desperate. Finally, one soldier took the lead to escape from the camp, followed by countless soldiers, and the moment of great defeat came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't let these two-legged sheep run away, I will use their heads to cast Jingguan, use their hair as needlework, use their skins as fabric, and sew them into...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The so-called orderly retreat was purely a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the disaster is approaching, they fly separately, and the order of the crown prince can't stop everyone's determination to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you can't outrun the Beamon cavalry, as long as you can outrun your teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Second Army, which was supposed to be broken, ran to the forefront of the fleeing team by virtue of its own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Crown Prince Caesar, who is the commander in chief of the three armies, he was forcibly taken away by his subordinates as soon as the army was defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, if you listen to his orders again, the family will have a feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The game of chasing and fleeing begins, and **** scenes continue to be staged. Looking around, they were all routs, and the Beamon cavalry behind them couldn't even chase them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, Chris IX, who was anxiously waiting for news, spurted out a mouthful of blood after receiving the battle report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If one general is incompetent, the whole army will be exhausted.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really understood this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything is too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A big battle organized with great difficulty ended in a disastrous defeat, directly bringing the Principality of Moxi to the edge of a cliff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary army of the Principality of Orton was over, the expeditionary army of the Earl of Ruilin was over, and several new legions of the family were also reimbursed during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force, which has high hopes, is left with the First Legion after this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a heavy price, but the result in exchange for defeating tens of thousands of orc cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the losses of the elite orcs, whether they reached four figures is uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they also have all-round medical soldiers \"sacrificing\" to accompany the army. As long as it is not killed on the spot or seriously injured, it can be pulled back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss was so heavy that the Crown Prince Caesar, who seemed to be in command of the battle, was the most responsible person. In fact, the Principality of Moxi was responsible for all the consequences caused by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no accountability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He came here to help as a volunteer. He worked desperately on the battlefield, and if he lost a battle, he did his best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the books, the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force suffered the most losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five legions went into battle together, and it is still unknown whether the troops who retreated in the end can make up one legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom didn't ask them to make a theory, so it's not bad. If you want to be held accountable, even your allies are not prepared to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king fell ill, and the crown prince was still young, obviously not suitable to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar of a neighboring country just paid an expensive tuition fee, and the Moxi royal family was also frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the current complicated situation, he dared not push his inexperienced crown prince to take charge. The power of the principality naturally fell into the hands of a group of ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Usually, when there is such a good thing, everyone will rush over it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation was special this time, all the princes and ministers also learned to be modest, and they all behaved politely, without any intention of seizing power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since everyone is so humble and no one wants to be the assistant minister, then we will wait until His Majesty the King wakes up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the aftermath, it is urgent now, and we must come up with a strategy as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply let everyone express their thoughts and opinions, and then all the ministers present vote together to choose the plan with the highest support rate as the result of the final decision. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said with a wry smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is very unfavorable to the principality, and if one is not careful, the country will be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle to defend Da Pest City is about to kick off. Judging from the current situation, the possibility of keeping it is very slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever comes out to preside over the overall situation means that whoever will bear the responsibility for the fall of Dapace City. Most of the blame for the collapse of the principality's situation will also be pinned on the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once such a big scapegoat is carried, it will never be taken off. It is a trivial matter to be notorious and infamous for a long time, but the key to the future liquidation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only will you lose yourself, but your family will also be involved. Once the political game starts, there is no way out. Don't expect everyone to be merciful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others can hide, but Herceg, the prime minister, cannot hide. In order to reduce his own responsibility, he simply pulled everyone together to make decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone looked at each other and nodded in agreement. This is not the best way, but it is the most effective way at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Collective decision-making and shared responsibility are better than constant evasion, and everyone will be weak together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that no one objected, Prime Minister Herceg bit the bullet and proposed:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is so modest, so I will talk about my own views first. The situation in the Principality is now difficult, and the following must be done:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, His Majesty the King can't have an accident now. This is related to the stability of people's hearts in the principality, and we must do our best to rescue it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take out any life-sustaining treasures! Now is not the time to care about personal gains and losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pay, you will be rewarded. Everyone will be a witness together, and the Principality will compensate you afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secondly, the defense of Da Pest City must be fully launched immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the current situation, if the city of Da Pest cannot be defended, the principality will continue to fight, so the temporary capital also needs to be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of proposals, most of which are negative responses, but miraculously none of them are counterattacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The extremely pessimistic proposal was approved by most of the people present. Obviously, the big battle that just happened had a serious impact on the senior management of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, other things can be done, but the withdrawal of the troops on the Terence line of defense is not possible now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the evacuation of the army, the safety of the people in the front-line castle. Just how to withdraw people is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that the orc army has penetrated deep into the hinterland of the Principality. Once the front-line army leaves the castle, their fate will be flanked by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To break through the siege and interception of the orc army, I am afraid that even if the dozens of troops on the front line can be withdrawn, none of them will survive in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the situation in the principality has collapsed, the Human Race Alliance is already discussing the issue of sending troops. We will get back the lost land now, sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the future of the principality, it is very necessary to preserve the vitality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war, we stored a lot of food and supplies in the fortresses on the front line. Even if the orc army cut off the connection with the rear, the defenders could hold out for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply give them an order, if you can hold on to the castle, continue to hold on, and attack if you have the opportunity to take the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the supplies are exhausted and you can't hold on, you can freely choose the direction to break through. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins suggested cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the minister of military affairs, he knew better than most of the people present how vulnerable Moxi's army was without the protection of the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the soldiers hide in the castle, facing the threat of the orcs, the defending general will definitely work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not extravagant to hope that all of them will become elites. As long as one-tenth of the serf soldiers are trained, it will be of great significance to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this critical juncture, the remote command is irresponsible to everyone. Delegating power is the only way to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Martins is right. At this time, it is indeed more dangerous to let the defenders retreat than to hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keeping these defenders on the front line can at least restrain the hundreds of thousands of orcs from moving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Withdrawing the people seems to be able to increase our defensive strength, but the army of orcs will also increase. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Renato decisively chose to support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about interests. The main force of my own private army is also on the front line. If I withdraw to participate in the battle to defend the capital, I might get all involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying on the front line is equally dangerous, but since the orcs choose to bypass the castle fortresses along the way, there is a high probability that they will not choose to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi can be destroyed, but the family estate cannot be ruined. As long as the elites on the front line are still there, even if all the territories in the rear fall, they can be taken back in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conversely, if the family's private army is all lost on the battlefield, no matter how well protected the rear is, it will be difficult to stop the prying eyes of those who are interested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Castle, when Hudson received the news of the defeat in the battle, it was already the third day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that in this matter, the Principality of Moxi chose to block the news at the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the few noble officers who escaped by chance and ran into his defense area by mistake, Hudson would have received the news later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was within his expectation that he would lose the battle. However, Hudson can only say that he is in admiration after being defeated to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The four-nation coalition combined has a total of 180,000 troops. So many soldiers and horses collapsed in one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an astonishing record is rare in the entire history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to achieve such a record, Hudson really wanted to pry open the head of Crown Prince Caesar to see what was inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after listening to the specific combat deployment and the actual command on the battlefield, he was left speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the supreme commander, the Crown Prince of Caesar, apart from only knowing how to follow the scriptures and rote, there is nothing wrong with the overall strategic deployment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core reason for the crushing defeat was that they miscalculated their own strength, ignored the changes in the situation on the battlefield, and did not leave enough reserves for emergency response.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to what seems correct on the macro level, there are more problems in the details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many resources to use in local operations, but it is a pity that the Crown Prince Caesar is useless at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But any general with more experience in military use will set up his camp in a nearby nobleman's castle, at least to ensure the absolute safety of food and grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the orc cavalry is, they can only detour when they see the city wall. It is only necessary to leave a small number of defenders, or even entrust them directly to the local nobles to guard them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem with the big camp, even if the front line is defeated, it can be withdrawn in an orderly manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a big defeat, the distance is only a few miles. The cavalry went up to pester the enemy, and the troops withdrew.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the orc army gives up its strategic goal of attacking Dapes, it is impossible to entangle with them for too long. It is not difficult to keep the main force of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many problems exposed in the command of Crown Prince Caesar, and the performance of the other three armies is also speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was careless, and I was not well prepared to be defeated by the Beamon cavalry. The key is the subsequent impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The myth and legend that a cavalry regiment attacked a legion head-on without many casualties actually appeared in front of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, the Beamon cavalry will become gods again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable how much this has hit the morale of the Terran coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous battle against Hudson was basically for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I wake up from the dream that I can do it, and everyone will only keep the myth that the Beamon cavalry is invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the case of Hudson annihilating the Beamon Cavalry Regiment, everyone will only think that the elite is not comparable to their ordinary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar was pitted, and pig teammates were also pitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In mutual pitfalls, they were defeated together. No one can figure out who cheated whom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom sent an order to let all the cavalry in the city go out of the city, try their best to search for the traces of Crown Prince Caesar, and gather the broken soldiers along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the officers below to gather the rout and not to get entangled with the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will bring back all the troops I meet along the way, no matter which country the soldiers are from. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It counts as much as the army can gather. At this time, there is only so much he can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the whereabouts of Crown Prince Caesar, it is not his turn to worry about it. Anyway, this battle has nothing to do with the First Legion, no matter how big the blame is, it cannot be thrown on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Initiating this campaign, Crown Prince Caesar never asked his opinion, let alone received any official documents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, let's go out and look for it together!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more people there are, the more powerful they are, and the possibility of finding His Royal Highness the Crown Prince will be greater. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the blood-stained young nobleman in front of him, Hudson rolled his eyes secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, he is young, and he can't even understand the truth and lies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be emphasizing the search for the whereabouts of the crown prince, but in fact the real purpose is to take the opportunity to gather the defeated troops to strengthen their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He brought out \"finding the whereabouts of the crown prince\" and emphasized that it was just a political statement, and it did not mean that he really welcomed the big trouble of Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are royal masters guarding the side, as long as it is not possessed by the **** of mildew and plunges into the army of orcs, it can always escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make his subordinates understand, Hudson even hinted that \"it's just gathering routs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a blatant statement, the chief guard who was born as a serf understood it, but these young nobles did not understand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's because she is too well protected by her family, lacks life experience, or is simply eager to be a savior, wanting to gain favor with Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orc army is eyeing the Flying Bear Castle. As the city guard, I can't leave my post without authorization. The task of finding the crown prince is left to a few of you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guards, hurry up and get some dry food and water bags, and give them to the knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The safety of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is related to the stability of the kingdom, and is of great significance to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late will change. For the sake of the safety of His Highness the Crown Prince, I will not retain a few of them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said cooperatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what these few people think in their hearts, it is necessary to strongly support the politically correct matter of finding the whereabouts of the crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all for the safety of the crown prince, so it doesn't matter if you suffer a little bit. Washing up and receiving the reception is too time-consuming, it is better to go directly to the road with dry food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

He led his subordinates to fight all the bitter battles, but the final spoils were snatched away by Duke Daniel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire pays attention to the strong prey on the weak, and the spoils that are eaten will not be spit out again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a great battle, apart from gaining fame, the Beamon army didn't see any substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although a lot of weapons and equipment were seized, they were bought with the casualties of soldiers. Regardless of the loss of the cannon fodder troops, the key is the loss of the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The rabbit is in a hurry and will bite people.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the opponent is the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the large-scale charge of the Beamon cavalry, the expeditionary army really had nothing to do, but facing the Beamon cavalry who were chasing after them, the noble knights who fled for their lives were not so cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with the single Beamon cavalry, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom are also experienced. Even if you haven't experienced it yourself, you have heard the elders in your family bragging about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's true or not. Anyway, nobles who can walk down the battlefield may not be able to learn the ability to command thousands of troops, but they must have learned a lot of pure combat skills and life-saving skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of inheritance can be found in almost every noble family. After all, if you are unlucky, the elders who participated in each war will die, and the family will not be passed down to the present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three or five Bimon cavalry chased them out, and they would never come back alive. When it comes to life and death, the noble knight with explosive potential still does not lack the determination to fight to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So that the Beamon cavalry lost less than four digits in the previous battle, but because the troops were too scattered in the follow-up pursuit of the enemy, the loss was increased to four digits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the battle, Prince Butzweig was surprised to find that the total strength of his direct lineage had dropped from more than 8,500 before the battle to less than 7,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the record achieved, such a loss is really nothing, but the pain is still inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the wolf cavalry came a little faster, the loss of the Beamon cavalry could definitely be controlled within a thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another loss of troops, another robbing of spoils of war, Prince Butzweig didn't get mad on the spot, that's all self-restraint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, praise!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My silver moon wolf cavalry is not as brave and good at fighting as the Beamon cavalry. The only advantage I can show is speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the speed is slower, I am afraid that there will be no place for us in the five imperial courts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel responded indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this battle was really won because the wolf cavalry arrived in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing such a shameless person, Prince Butzweig could do nothing. Things happen, and even winning the argument won't help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time I was taken advantage of by the Silver Moon Imperial Court, so I can only find a way to make up for it next time. The infighting between the five imperial courts did not happen every day or two, and digging pits with each other had long been the norm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig will not be relentless if his position changes and he tricks his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how torn it apart, this battle was won by the joint efforts of the two imperial courts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the army of the Silver Moon Imperial Court did not attack the camp of the allied forces of the human race, the expeditionary force would not have collapsed. Facing the Beamon cavalry alone, no matter how heavy the casualties are, the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force can carry it through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, what is fought on the battlefield is confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the morale of the army does not collapse, even if more troops from the Silver Moon Imperial Court join in, the expeditionary army, which has the superiority in strength, can still fight to the death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it will fail in the end, but at least it can get a decent ending. For example: Both losers suffer, and the orc army only wins miserably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Prince Butzweig directly left a back. He failed to ask for an explanation, and he wrote down the account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning of the war to the present, the Direct Legion has lost more than 30% of its personnel, and it has suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this great battle was won beautifully, and the imperial court's supplementary troops were already on the way, which slightly comforted Prince Butzweig's wounded heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the fourth day of the failure of the great battle, that is, September 7, 99988 in the sacred calendar, the Principality of Moxi finally gave this failed battle an official name \"Battle of Dacias\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no technical content in the naming, just because the main battle locations are in Daqi and Yass. After some quarrels, everyone made a compromise and chose to put the two place names together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The senior officials of the Principality of Moxi chose to block the news of the defeat internally, but they had another diametrically opposite attitude towards the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after the first high-level meeting after the defeat, the news was passed on. In order to obtain more international aid, they even exaggerated their own losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the unlucky ones who jointly paid for the defeat, Caesar III's beard stood up in anger after the news reached the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you lose troops or lose generals. From the moment the expeditionary army was dispatched, there was no expectation that these troops would be able to retreat unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the crux of the problem is that the supreme commander in command of this battle is actually his precious son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that this epic defeat battle will be recorded in the annals of history along with the life of his son Little Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of the royal family has been completely lost in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to find someone to take the blame. The defeat in this battle was too tragic. At the same time, the Principality of Moxi, the Principality of Orton, and the Earl of Ruilin suffered heavy losses. Others could not bear it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell the Mosi people, I don't care what is going on in this battle, anyway, little Caesar can't have any accidents!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reputation cannot be washed away, then simply don't bother to wash it. The big battle can fail, but the precious son can't have an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Full of anger, there was no place to vent, and Caesar III couldn't help venting his anger on the Principality of Moxi. If it wasn't for helping them in the past, they wouldn't have trapped their son in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he just wanted to provide a high-level experience. According to his original plan, the crown prince just went to observe and study, and by the way, he would gain some military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if one can cultivate extraordinary military command ability, it will be even more lucrative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The early stage went very smoothly. The First Legion fought on the front line to earn their military exploits. As the commander-in-chief, the crown prince only needs to sit behind and watch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two good news came, and Caesar III thought that his son had grown up and learned the skills necessary for a monarch—sit back and reap the rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the slap in the face came too fast. The country is still promoting the record of the First Army of the Expeditionary Army to wipe out the Beamon Cavalry Regiment. My son immediately sent an epic defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even counting the wolf cavalry who participated in the battle, the total force ratio of the two sides in the war was 180,000 VS 70,000, an absolute superiority in force, and the first day of the battle was defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Placing it anywhere is a proper negative teaching material.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured. At this time, the Moxi people will not let His Royal Highness be surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps at this time, they have already found His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, but they didn't have time to deliver the news. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland forcibly comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His Majesty the King's suffering, he can fully understand. It would be uncomfortable for anyone to meet such an uneasy son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the safety of the crown prince, as long as the guards sent out are not dead, no accidents will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, in addition to the masters sent by the royal family, the Principality of Moxi also sent masters to protect secretly. Everyone is very careful about this top-level second generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the Mosi people attach more importance to the safety of Crown Prince Caesar than their own crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made Caesar III such a single seedling?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an accident, who knows what the crazy Caesar III will do next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When that Nizi comes back, I will definitely make him look good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An order was passed down to relieve the Crown Prince of the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force and be replaced by Viscount Hudson, the commander of the First Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finding the crown prince, take him back to the country immediately. If you don't obey, tie me back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From his slightly relieved expression, it can be seen that Caesar III's anger has been suppressed a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own, there is no way. As long as there is no accident for the son, other problems will not be taken care of so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The failure of the great battle can basically declare that the Principality of Moxi is going to be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, to stay in the Principality of Moxi is to dance on the tip of a knife. If you are not careful, you will lose your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dismissal of the crown prince seems to be a punishment, but it is actually a father's love for his son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the title of commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force falling to Hudson, there is simply no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of the six legions that went on the expedition, five were directly defeated and collapsed. Among the high-ranking officers on the front line, except for Hudson, who is the only seedling, even if the rest can save a life, they still bear the responsibility of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a defeated general, it would be nice not to be questioned, how could he continue to be promoted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the Alpha Kingdom is willing to fill the quagmire of the Principality of Moxi with more troops. Otherwise, the First Legion is the last face of the Expeditionary Force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether there are personnel appointments or not, Hudson has now become the de facto commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Competitors do not exist. Everyone thought that rescuing the Principality of Moxi was breaking into a dragon's lake and a tiger's den. Now it only proves this point better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are big nobles with more senior qualifications, they will not jump out at this moment to grab this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knows that the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force is of a high rank, he still has great authority. In the Principality of Moxi, it can represent the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Orton, King Orton XIX, who received the news, couldn't help but swear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the Crown Prince Caesar to the high-level commanders of the countries participating in the war, he greeted them all over and over again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it was the expeditionary force coach Raimondo who received the most spray. It doesn't matter if you lose the battle. It would be too much to lose the 30,000 army that the Duke of Orton painstakingly assembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that once the Principality of Moxi is cold, the Principality of Orton will also become dangerous. Without this neighbor standing in front of them, these small countries are simply unable to resist the orc's soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, issue the highest mobilization order!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This big battle directly ruined hundreds of thousands of mobile troops, and the Moxi people have lost the ability to launch a counterattack strategically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next battle to defend Dapes City can only delay for a while. According to the most optimistic estimate of the military, they can last up to one and a half months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that at the end of October, the Principality of Moxi will lie down. If it is delayed until November at most, the resistance of the Principality of Moxi will fall into a trough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army, with no energy to release, will look for new prey.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It could be the Kingdom of Alpha, it could be the Kingdom of Warhammer, it could be us as well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Jacob said with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sorrow of a weak country is reflected at this time. The defeat of the expeditionary force directly exposed the reality of the Principality of Orton to the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs set them as a breakthrough target, even if they just send out a partial army to invade, the Principality of Orton will find it difficult to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That short word seems to have exhausted all the strength of Orton Nineteenth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are still being staged in the homes of neighbors in the Principality of Moxi. Realizing that the danger was really approaching, one after another entered the national mobilization mode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One after another serfs were continuously conscripted into the army; one army after another was continuously compiled and trained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Overnight, all countries in the north started national mobilization. Regardless of the combat effectiveness of these troops, the number has indeed expanded, as if only the number can reassure everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the countries work harder in supporting the Moxi Principality, even if it is only one-third of the current mobilization intensity, the situation will definitely not collapse to the point where it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, after receiving the news of the failure of the Dacias Battle, the noisy members of the House of Representatives rarely calm down and start thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, everyone is waiting for the decision of the forces behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation deteriorated too quickly, and the original delaying tactics could no longer satisfy the current development of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more countries involved, the lower the efficiency of making decisions, and the worse the implementation will be in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a person in power, these issues must be taken into consideration. Even if the support plan is launched immediately, it will be a matter of the coming year when reinforcements from various countries gather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a long time, I don't know what will happen halfway. It would be fine if the northern countries could hold on, but if they all suffered a big defeat like the Principality of Moxi, then it would be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the northern countries accounts for almost one-fifth of the power of the human race. If it breaks and goes in, the various alien races suppressed by the human race will probably jump out of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene of fighting a hundred clans alone, just imagining it makes one's scalp tingle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the human race was able to obtain the status of the continent's overlord only relied on military strength for one-third, and the remaining seven percent relied on political means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dividing, disintegrating, and provoking confrontation between various races are the core strategies of the Terran Alliance for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that after the human race has established itself as the overlord of the mainland, they continue to occupy the living space of all races and gradually become the public enemy of the mainland. These political methods are becoming more and more pale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how nicely you say it, it depends on what you do in the end. There are more and more black histories, and the relationship between the human race and various races has become more and more subtle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has developed to the present, and it has gradually changed from the original three-point military and seven-point politics to seven-point military and three-point politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mainland hegemon dominated by military means must maintain a strong position at all times. Any trace of decadence may trigger a new continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Members, everyone can see the news from the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of development, the strength of the orc empire is stronger than that of the last two-clan war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the comparison of strength, the strength of the Orc Empire has exceeded the critical point, posing a serious threat to our dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we need to discuss the topic, in addition to driving the orcs back to their hometown, we also need to consider how to cut off this potential threat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't expect to completely destroy them, and the various races will not allow us to do that, but at the very least, we must severely damage the Orc Empire, and it is best to be able to destroy them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Members of Parliament, the peaceful days have passed for too long, and many alien races have forgotten the majesty of my human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to find someone to stand up to, and show off the prestige of our human race, so as to deter the hundreds of races in the mainland. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III's words instantly caused an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no idea not to lift the lid.

None of the three big countries in the north has fallen, and it is far from the point where the Human Race Alliance needs to fully intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, for the countries that are fighting the orcs, the Terran Alliance's decision to go to war is the best news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drive the orcs out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This pattern is obviously too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the human race has been divided for a long time, it is still the overlord of the mainland. Once it becomes ruthless, all ethnic groups have to deal with it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the practice of previous race wars, the Human Race Alliance will not stop unless it shows the prestige of the continent's overlord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City, all the princes and nobles who received the news couldn't believe it was true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The turning point came too suddenly. The Terran Alliance not only decided to take action, but also raised the war to the height of a full-scale racial war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reinforcements did not know where the corner was, everyone's confidence was instantly boosted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Renato, has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the accuracy of the news?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is really the final decision of the Terran Alliance, not a proposal! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he made a big fuss, the news is really amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Proposals for a full race of orcs are not uncommon. At almost every Terran Alliance meeting, the Alpha Kingdom would bring it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can be passed, but not once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, all countries have their own small abacus. After defeating the orc empire, the Alpha Kingdom gained the most, and other human nations could only follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some small countries can't even drink soup, and enclaves far in the north are useless even if they are given to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Alpha Kingdom had publicly promised that it would exchange territories with other countries after the orc empire was wiped out, it still failed to impress them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the Principality of Moxi, before not bordering on the orcs, they also voted against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all a disaster caused by interests. Without the restraint of the orc empire, it was almost inevitable for the Alpha Kingdom to grow in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting fiercely with the orc empire for hundreds of years, the accumulated war experience and the mobilization system honed are simply not comparable to other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a neighbor, the Alpha Kingdom grows bigger, which is a nightmare for the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi didn't change its position until it bordered the orc empire and saw the horror of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the Alpha Kingdom is a human country, and it must abide by the rules of the game. It is impossible to provoke war at will when it is internal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the history of civil wars in various countries of the human race, we can see that 99% of the wars did not involve territorial changes. Even if you win the battle, you cannot seize the opponent's land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to expand internally, the first problem you need to face is legality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this thing, even if the land is knocked down, it can only be obediently spit out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles will not recognize illegal rule, and the Human Alliance does not allow illegal expansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By violating the rules of the game, you will be hostile by the entire noble group, and the encirclement net will be full at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the protection of rules, a small country like the Earl of Ruilin would have been swallowed by people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a neighbor with a big country is nothing more than being wronged, but it is definitely not life-threatening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are good at dancing, you may not even have to suffer grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the royal families of all countries mostly relatives?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are not a relative now, you can become a relative later. The circle of the royal family is so big, it's hard not to get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-level relationship has been dealt with, and there will be some small frictions of emotional disputes below. During the day, the two gangs are fighting, and at night they can attend banquets together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe after drinking a few glasses of wine, everyone will become good brothers again, and the war will be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What a civilization!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the orc empire that killed all the way, all human nations are model good neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to realize this. In the Human Race Alliance Parliament where the opposition has an absolute majority, adding one or two support votes will not affect the result of the resolution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, how could the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not verify such a big matter?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people have personally participated in voting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Charles III who proposed launching an all-out war. The reason was that the strength shown by the orcs exceeded the warning line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should have heard of the \"Five Times Dominance Act\". As long as the strength of any race on the Aslant continent reaches 20% of my human race, it will be automatically triggered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the just-concluded \"Battle of Dacias\", the orc army showed super strength, so most of the representatives attending the meeting believed that the strength of the orc empire had reached 20% of that of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's why this vote will pass smoothly. People including the Holy See did not vote against it this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Orc Empire knew that it had attracted suppression from the Human Race Alliance because of its impressive victory on the battlefield, it would probably feel regretful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Challenging the supremacy of the human race is one thing. All races on the mainland except the human race want to pull the human race from their supremacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But none of them dared to take action, including the Orc Empire, which has always been constantly testing the bottom line of the human race, instead of directly stating that the chariots and horses are going to be challengers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very realistic, the early rafters are rotten first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the human race can be pulled down from its dominance, the one who initiates the challenge first will definitely receive the worst beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone still looked puzzled, Renato continued to add:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The alliance parliament was able to quickly pass the proposal, which may also have something to do with the legendary ten thousand year catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this ten-thousand-year catastrophe, which happens to be stuck at the point of one hundred thousand years, and no one knows what will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, all alien races on the mainland are hidden dangers to our rule of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous meeting, some representatives proposed: clear the venue, and also won the support of many representatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the strength of the various ethnic groups in the mainland is not weak. Once we take action to clear the field, they will definitely join forces to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warning all races at the same time, we have no chance of winning. This proposal was eventually rejected by the faction of reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inability to clear the field on a large scale does not mean that the alliance cannot do anything. The Orc Empire came to their door this time, providing the alliance with an excellent excuse to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the strength of the orc empire exceeds 20% of our human race, it doesn't really matter. This was only deliberately exposed to the outside world, mainly to cover up the purpose of clearing the field. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This explanation is much more reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the orc empire is approaching the critical point, and it is not a matter of a day or two. It makes no sense to be specially brought up at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when the two problems are superimposed, they are no longer the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The failure of the battle was only the fuse, and the root cause was the dominance of the human race on the continent. Before the legendary catastrophe broke out, it was inevitable to attack a wave of competitors first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether there are other insider transactions, you can only ask His Majesty the King on the hospital bed. This kind of secret matter is usually handled by the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Chris IX became sick from overwork, especially the continuous high pressure after the outbreak of the war, and now he is exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed ways to wake up the king, but the current state of Chris IX, once awakened by stimulation, is almost at the end of his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current situation in the Principality of Moxi, the most important thing is stability. At this juncture, the king must not have an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Chris IX is lying unconscious on the hospital bed, it is better than changing the king and causing political turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter what the reason is, this is good news. We must pass the news to every nobleman as quickly as possible to boost the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the previously formulated Dapez defense plan, it must also be revised now. Although the reinforcements from the Terran Alliance will not be able to arrive for a while, it is still possible to provide us with some support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: air power support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Flying Dragon Cavalry of the Holy See, the Pterosaur Cavalry of the Frankish Kingdom, the Giant Eagle Cavalry of the Kingdom of Iberia...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the external coordination is good and they are invited over, it will not be the turn of Yingren to be rampant on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dapest City has perfect fortifications and has regained air supremacy. We may not be unable to hold on until reinforcements arrive! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins said enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to stick to it, no one is willing to give up their own capital. In particular, the current terrain of the Principality of Moxi is special. Once the city of Dapace falls, there will be no danger to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the northern region fell, but most of the provinces in the central and western regions could only tremble under the iron hooves of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small number of mountainous areas that can be defended, more than 80% of the principality's land will be easily occupied by the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the territories of a large number of nobles are all in this 80% of the land. It can be said that the fall of the city of Dapace meant \"losing one's home\" to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is a chance to get the land back after the war, they have to clean up the mess by themselves in the purgatory on earth that was ravaged by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bethel Fortress, the top five orc royal families gathered together again. From the gloomy faces of everyone, we can see the seriousness of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One moment they were still celebrating victory in the battle, and the next moment they received news that the Terran Alliance had launched a full-scale racial war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of reverse stimulation of the two heavens of ice and fire is unbearable for most people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is completely out of control. The various races that originally agreed to fight against the human race did not respond to our actions in time, but instead angered the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the all-out racial war starts, the enemies we need to face are not just the three northern countries, but all races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With our current strength, it is almost impossible to fight against the entire human race alone. There are not many options before us now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or immediately carry out strategic contraction, give up all the land currently occupied, pack up and withdraw, and use the geographical advantage to slowly deal with the human army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or simply do something big, and take advantage of the fact that the reinforcements from the Human Race Alliance have not arrived, and destroy the northern countries first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The positions of all ethnic groups in the mainland are not firm. As long as the situation develops to our side, no one will follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all parties cooperate well, even if the human race cannot be pulled down from the position of the overlord of the mainland at one time, it can still inflict heavy damage on them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yingren Huang said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the fear that flashed across his eyebrows from time to time exposed his true inner thoughts. Bullying the few human nations in the north is okay, but if it is against the entire human alliance, the power of the orc empire is obviously not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Five-fold Advantage Act\" of the Terran Alliance is not a display, but a real implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter which race it is, once it reaches the critical point, it will attract a thunderous blow from the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar beatings were not the first time in the history of orcs. Even with just a few words in the history books, it still makes them feel terrified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the human race is now divided, the overall strength of the race has not decreased much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eagle Emperor, there is no option to retreat. At this point, even if we want to stop, the clan will not be able to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all the people in the tribe know the horror of the human race. In the eyes of most of the beast gods, the human race is a group of two-legged sheep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we really retreat by force, I am afraid that before the Human Race Alliance comes over, something will happen to us first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning up the northern countries of the human race and attracting all races to join this war is our only way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To achieve this, many of our past habits must be changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blindly killing will only trigger the fiercest resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes killing people is not the best way to solve a problem. Appropriate use of flexible means can often bring more trouble to the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: take young and strong serfs for our own use, and let them cultivate the land for us. Put the useless old and weak back, and continue to consume the enemy's food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those hypocritical aristocrats who flaunt benevolence can't watch their people go hungry!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of thousands or millions of refugees rushing over together, the destructive power that can be caused is not necessarily worse than the effect of our dispatching a large army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his view, the failure of previous wars was because they helped the human race solve logistical problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The large number of refugees that should have been caused by the war were all disposed of by the orc army, and the destruction was not extended to the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this kind of **** killing also inspired the desperate resistance of everyone, causing a large number of casualties to the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex, your thinking is too simple. Letting the serfs go is easy, but what about our logistics?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the lengthening of the front, the support that the rear can provide us has become very small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now more than 80% of the supplies consumed by the army are captured from the front lines, and the soldiers need a lot of meat supplements...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lion King shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone can weigh the pros and cons, but logistics is also a big problem. Regardless of the smooth advance of the orc army, in fact, except for the main army's supply of supplies, the other soldiers are often hungry and full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you observe carefully, you can often see orc soldiers picking wild fruits and leaves, digging fresh grass and wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the strong digestive system of the soldiers, they could stuff everything into their stomachs, and relying on the logistics supplies they provided, they would have starved to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is heavy physical work, and the body of soldiers who eat only vegetarians will definitely not be able to withstand it. Meat supplementation is particularly important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear's Fort, watching the broken soldiers constantly gathering, Master Hudson was in a particularly happy mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The recruiting regiment with a serious shortage is already full at this moment. Looking at the current situation, as long as you work harder, the number of legions under your command can be increased by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter which country's soldiers they are, they are all soldiers of his Lord Hudson who entered the Fort of Flying Bear. The noble officers have opinions, so let's first discuss the issue of fleeing on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether he has the power to pursue accountability, Master Hudson will pursue it anyway. Those who were obedient entered the army and made meritorious deeds, while those who were disobedient were sent to prison for \"running away\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Evidence, not required. If he hadn't run away, he would have already met the Lord of Dawn. Those who can save a life are those who escape fast enough on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanation is meaningless, and no matter how good the reasons are, it will not change the fact of running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has already verified that, except for the orderly retreat issued by Crown Prince Caesar, the commanders of the Duchy of Orton and the Duchy of Ruilin have not even issued an order to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the situation is, if you leave the army and run away, you can be charged with fleeing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this charge, it is not detaining nobles without authorization, but arresting deserters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these guys are handed over to other countries after the war, they cannot escape accountability afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two paths before them: either go to the battlefield to perform crimes and meritorious deeds; or be deprived of their noble status in the process of accountability, and accept military law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all smart people. Even if there are hotheaded people, after a few days of calming down in prison, their brains will become sober.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the defeated soldiers is not good, but their physical fitness is still very good. They have all gone through the test of life and death and stood out from the crowd of fleeing teammates to be able to appear here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the morale problem is solved and a little training is done, it will be a unit with good combat effectiveness. Fight a few more victories, and those who survive will be elite soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extreme joy begets sorrow, which is the best portrayal of Hudson's life. At the same time as he gathered the broken troops to expand his strength, a letter of appointment from the Alpha Kingdom also fell into his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Commander of the Alpha Kingdom's Expeditionary Force in the Principality of Moxi\", the title is loud enough, but the kingdom gave him only one title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the increased responsibilities and obligations on his body, Hudson still commands as many soldiers as he used to command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Substantial power has not increased at all.

The weight of words and deeds is completely different from before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact was that the rout soldiers gathered became more law-abiding, especially the officers and soldiers of the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Army, who behaved extraordinarily well-behaved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous ultra vires handling, now Hudson is their legal commander, and they can be held accountable for \"deserting soldiers\" at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bringing crimes and making meritorious service\" is no longer a joke, but has really become a reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to deliberately target them, just report the facts, and what awaits them is the accusation of the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to find relationship activities. The responsibility for the failure of the big battle is now entirely on the head of Crown Prince Caesar. The king was worried about how to relieve his son of responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they dared to jump out, Caesar III would definitely not mind attributing the failure of the battle to the fact that some noble officers were greedy for life and fear of death, and fled before the battle, leading to the defeat of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no blame now, because the situation in the country is not clear about the front line. Otherwise, they, the surviving noble officers, would most likely take the blame for the Crown Prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is not wronged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the big rout broke out, they were the ones who took the lead in running away, and did not perform their duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson can understand this kind of thing. We are all ordinary people, and it is normal that we cannot face life and death calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure in field battles, this kind of thing has always happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for meeting Hudson, the fate waiting for these guys is permanent homelessness. It doesn't matter where you go, anyway, it's impossible to go back to your hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the handle in hand, these nobles showed extra effort during training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few surviving legion leaders, who have been out of shape. The nobles at the bottom don't know the seriousness of the matter, but it doesn't mean they don't know either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Die crime and meritorious service\" does exist, but the credit that needs to be made is not a little bit, at least it is several times the fault.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially their group, which also involved the crown prince, was passively involved in the kingdom's power disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless there is a big man to protect, otherwise a little credit will not fill the hole at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of this naturally cannot escape Hudson's eyes. These guys are not qualified to be legion commanders, but it is still very useful to drop one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, the private army in the hands of these guys has a very good combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they suffer a big defeat, they can gather hundreds of people to run together, which is considered elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting in a foreign land, any power is precious. Regardless of the integrity of these people, it is impossible for them to defect to the orcs anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put it in the right place, don't worry about not being able to play a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Andres, Viscount Goodson, Viscount Robles, in your current state, are you dissatisfied with me taking you down from the position of legion commander?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or, do you think that I am deceiving you, that it is a joke to commit crimes and make meritorious deeds?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why is my reputation so worthless, in order to deceive some of you defeated generals, can I use it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not good at playing tricks, but it doesn't matter, he will fool around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era of relying on fame for a living, no one dares to ignore their own reputation. It's definitely not worth it to risk your reputation for a few defeated generals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we have never doubted your sincerity. But this time the matter is too big. The Kingdom may let the people below go, but we will definitely be held accountable.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Viscount Andres looked at Hudson with resentment in his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be saying, if you didn't send someone to find you, we would have already run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who disappear on the battlefield will be regarded as dead in battle by default.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dead do not need to bear responsibility, sons can inherit the title, and family members can continue to live as nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were very unfortunate. On the way to escape, they were found by the cavalry sent by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of being alive is exposed, and if they escape again, they will be wanted by the Human Race Alliance, and there is no place for them in the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, I can only report to Flying Bear Castle according to the information given by the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Andres, you are too absolute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knew what was going on at the Battle of Dacias. From the beginning of the war, the outcome of failure is doomed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put the army in the wild to fight the orcs. Even if you succeed in defeating the Beamon army, the troops of the other four imperial courts will rush forward soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of absolute strength, it cannot be reversed by personal will, so there is no need to take it to heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the kingdom, it's actually not as bad as you imagined. If you are convicted of a felony, Crown Prince Caesar can get away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One great Caesar III is enough, no one wants to see another great Caesar IV. Now everyone wants Caesar IV to be mediocre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What this means, presumably all three of them know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battlefield is a magical place, which can not only make people fall into the abyss, but also make people ascend to a high position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't try, how will you know you can't do it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than waiting for accountability, it is better to fight. Even if you get nothing in the worst case, you can choose to die on the battlefield! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to bewitch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether these people can commit crimes and make meritorious deeds. The key is that Hudson now needs them to work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Post-war is a matter of post-war. Only by ensuring that you can survive until the end of the war can you be qualified to consider post-war issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Royal Highness, we should leave.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the defeat of the army, the Crown Prince Caesar, who has embarked on the road of escape, seems to have changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, it was rage, then crying, and finally became taciturn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fledgling boy has been going smoothly for more than ten years, and has always been indoctrinated that he is the best. Sudden beating was the most violent, and the impact on Crown Prince Caesar was huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is also an essential part of every king's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After going through ups and downs, and coming out of the trough, you have the opportunity to become a qualified monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are no setbacks, their parents will often deliberately set up difficult problems for them to sharpen their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to others, the difference is only that the pit that Crown Prince Caesar stepped on is deeper, and it is more difficult to climb out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where do we go now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar asked coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of shame, he doesn't want to see any acquaintances now. I always feel that others are polite on the surface, but they are mocking him secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no one mentioned the failure of the battle in front of him, Caesar, who was educated by the royal family, still noticed something strange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"An order came from the country, Your Majesty asked you to return home immediately. The position of commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force will be taken over by the commander of the Hudson Army.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose spoke the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things will be known to Crown Prince Caesar sooner or later. He has been forcibly ordered to return to the country, and it is naturally impossible for the expeditionary force to let him continue to command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it came out, there were six legions, and now there is only one seedling left, so it can't be harmed anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood. As expected of him. He is always so ruthless towards losers, even my son can't get a second chance.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Crown Prince Caesar's complaints, Count Jose wanted to plug his ears. The crown prince complained that the king was fine, but he, a retainer, shouldn't have heard it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, his opinions on Crown Prince Caesar are also growing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Second chance\" is easy to say, but the problem is that the cost is too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Battle of Dacias lost the five legions of the kingdom. If it happened again, the nobles of the kingdom would have to fry the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now recall the Crown Prince Caesar, stop the experience in advance, and stop the loss in time is the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of thing that seems very natural to ordinary people is obviously not so easy to accept for the young crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, I still have too little experience, and I don't realize the cruelty of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Highness, Your Majesty also has difficulties. This incident has caused great criticism in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially now that the situation in the Principality of Moxi is deteriorating, it may collapse at any time. Many people attributed the responsibility to the failure of this battle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Jose bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is no need to explain, I understand everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it because if I leave later, the blame for the collapse of the Principality of Moxi will also be blamed on me, or they are already preparing to place this charge on my head? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of hearing and seeing, he is very familiar with political matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shipping the pot and magnifying responsibility are only the most elementary ways to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the tense situation now, everyone is busy dealing with the orcs and has no time to provoke infighting, the matter will definitely not end like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the big nobles in the country are not doing anything, it doesn't mean that the matter is over. After the war is over, it is inevitable that someone will jump out and turn over old accounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Power struggles cannot tolerate tenderness. As local princes, the great nobles naturally do not want the monarchy to expand indefinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the mighty Caesar III, everyone is powerless. Then you can only catch the bullying crown prince to negotiate terms with the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing doesn't mean being able to understand. Being in the vortex of a storm, not everyone can face it calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar hated this kind of political struggle very much, and wanted to break through a world by his own ability. It's a pity that it was still a wrong payment after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peaceful years are always short. The Dapez defense war broke out, and the situation in the Principality of Moxi has reached the most critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Round after round of offensives made the defenders in the city exhausted. The Terran Alliance, which has high hopes, has indeed agreed to send troops, but dozens of countries are involved, and no one can tell when the reinforcements will arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is certain is that this year is too late. Even several countries that had already sent troops, after the battle of Dacias, made excuses to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alliance air support, that can only be thought about first. The envoys are still on the way, and there must be no hope in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terence Front Command Headquarters, Marshal Hodge is looking at the military order in his hand and worrying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the third day of the battle to defend the capital, he received three similar military orders—to cut off the logistics of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the initiative to attack and cut off the logistics of the orc army. There is nothing wrong with the strategy. But the problem is that when it comes to specific implementation, the situation has changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the defenders left the city, the orc army followed. After a tentative fight, they could only retreat back into the city in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are no bold officers who took the risk to attack the logistics of the orcs, but the results were somewhat touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't rob much food and grass. On his way back, he was blocked by an army of orcs who came after hearing the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a fight, they fled back to the fort after exhausting all their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the commander was shrewd enough not to covet the loot, but directly set fire to the grain truck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, judging from the current situation, the troops left by the orcs here can still suppress us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost impossible to completely cut off the logistics of the orc army under their noses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can only selectively complete the orders of the royal capital. Or simply let the defenders in various places play freely, take the initiative to attack every few days, and cause trouble to the orcs as much as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halley couldn't help suggesting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he is very aware of how unreliable his suggestions are, but the domestic military orders are even more unreliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disturbing the logistics transportation line of the orc army, everyone worked hard and could barely do it. Want to completely cut off the enemy's logistics, do you really think the orc army outside the city is dead?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just send a message to the generals below, Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force, you go there and go there yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Hudson has gathered a lot of broken soldiers recently. He heard that the establishment of the six major corps of the Expeditionary Army has been half restored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was hard enough for him. At this time, they can pull the team up. It's a pity that Crown Prince Caesar doesn't know how to employ people, otherwise he won't end up in despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among all the defenders, the Earl of Hudson now has the richest troops. To go out and attack the logistics of the orc army, it is necessary to ask them to contribute. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge said with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the ability to pull the team, he really admires Hudson. Others fought wars with fewer and fewer soldiers, but this soldier fought more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking the position of commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, Hudson immediately legalized the privately expanded troops. The flags of the Second Army and the Third Army of the Expeditionary Army were hung.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat effectiveness of these legions composed of rout soldiers and civilian husbands is still unclear for the time being. Anyway, the number of troops expanded at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three legions added together, the total strength of the expeditionary force has reached 43,000, which is almost half of the strength of the heyday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you add the newly formed 23rd Army of the Principality of Moxi and the Defense Army of the Flying Bear Castle, there will be even more troops that can be mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Castle, Hudson is busy training the army. Especially for the two newly formed legions, they have given special attention to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is different from the past where noble officers are trained first, and then soldiers are organized for training. This time, in order to save time, the officers and soldiers were directly trained together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dignity of the nobility is not a group of people who \"do crimes and make meritorious deeds\". They are qualified to have it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This \"inferior\" gap was completely deliberately created by Hudson. The purpose is to stimulate the self-esteem of these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Shame can only be washed away with blood. It's not the enemy's, it's your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to regain respect, you can only go to the battlefield to get it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instilling these guys over and over again, in order to revive the morale of the army, Hudson also broke his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Adjutant Harley from the frontline headquarters is here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the chief guard reminded Hudson of the official document he threw into the trash can a few days ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bring him over here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The main purpose is to get them moving so that the orcs don't continue to increase their troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no specific data, Hudson can also calculate that the orc army besieging Dapes will not be less than 300,000 based on the mobilization of troops from the Bearman Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This number is still increasing. Although the elite troops are only the first ones, the cannon fodder seems to have no upper limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for all this is clear without studying Hudson. It is nothing more than the nobles in the inland provinces are easier to bully, and it is less difficult to obtain food supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any castle, conquering it will bring a lot of gains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the defenders burned the granary, it would be useless. The stomachs of the orcs were strong enough to satisfy their hunger with charred grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the speed of breaking the city is fast enough, the food will not be burned out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With all the meat and food available, the pressure on logistics has been reduced, so we can naturally continue to increase troops to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many ants kill elephants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching more and more besieged orc armies, the pressure on the isolated defenders can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood Baron Harley, please tell Marshal Hodge, we will wait for the opportunity to find a fighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within this month at the latest, the expeditionary force will plan a major operation, just let him wait for our good news. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson promised heartily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are actions, and the specific time depends on when the orcs give them a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, elite soldiers are produced, and Hudson also needs to find a suitable opportunity to let the two newly formed legions meet blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Battle of Dacias cannot be counted, and the defeated soldiers who are chased by others will not have the effect of exercise at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you Earl Hudson for your understanding. Your Excellency the Marshal is under a lot of pressure now. To tell you the truth, we have failed to return after several attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are aware of the situation in Dapace. The Terran Alliance decided to launch a war against the orcs, but the issue of troop quotas was still arguing. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Halley said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from outsiders like Hudson, the local nobles of the Principality of Moxi have great expectations for the defense of Dapez, or this is their last hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once Dapace falls, the Principality of Moxi can basically declare coolness. Just listen to the relocation of the capital and fight again, the most affluent Great Plains are lost, and the remaining rotten land simply cannot support the next war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Restoring the country after the war depends on the situation. If it was just to drive away the orc army, with this evil neighbor, it is estimated that not many people would plan to plot the land of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time the Terran Alliance is determined to give the orcs a good look. In case the orc empire is really hit hard, it helps the Alpha Kingdom regain its lost ground, and the Principality of Moxi has become a safe rear again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wealth + security, looting is inevitable. The nobles who participated in the war came together to share the pie, and the Principality of Moxi, which relied on others to support the restoration of the country, did not speak hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way is to be able to stand up, lest they all be beaten into exiled nobles, with no capital in their hands, and can only let outsiders come to share the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Baron Harley, the problems facing our two countries are similar. If there is a problem in your country, we will not be much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at what the orcs did was clearly the last madness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that they were frightened by the alliance's resolution, trying to quickly sweep the northern land before the coalition forces of various countries came, so as to attract other alien races to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this evil approach is doomed to fail. The great Lord of Dawn will not watch his people being slaughtered by orcs all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the last darkness before dawn, the light will come soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the delay in the arrival of reinforcements from various countries, I think your country can first seek some help from the alliance that can be realized as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: lack of strategic materials, weapons and equipment, or high-end power support, especially air power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hawkmen fly above our heads all day long, and many secrets are exposed, which is really hard to guard against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The connection between our various units still needs to be strengthened. If you have enough air power and link the defenders on the entire defense line, the combat effectiveness that can be exerted can definitely be doubled. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't take something from the Human Race Alliance, you can't take it for nothing. If it really received funding from various countries, as an expeditionary force representing the Alpha Kingdom, it would definitely be able to get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the debt issue involved, that is a matter of the Principality of Moxi, and has nothing to do with him, the guest general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small calculations are not important, the key is that these suggestions are really solving problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nesting in the Fort of Flying Bears, he hesitated to take any action, not because the orc army was powerful, and it was not because Hudson was timid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, Hudson has been studying the habits of Eagle scouts, hoping to find an opportunity to give them a wave of ruthlessness, and plan a hunting operation by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is still a high level of uncertainty. If the Eagle scouts were cautious enough to observe from a distance and not come within range, Hudson could do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the scouts succeed for the first time, the scouts will not return for a long time, and the enemy will send people over for the second and third time. It is only a matter of time before they are exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Bear Stearns makes a move, there is no way to guarantee that a large number of Eagles will be kept. After all, flying in the air, the line of sight is wide enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adjacent Eagle scouts can keep a sufficient distance. It is also difficult to complete at the same time if you want to silence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to take action, the time left for the army to act is only a few hours. The battle must be ended quickly before the troops are withdrawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I will truthfully report your feedback to the country. I will notify you as soon as I have the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to strengthen communication, I can apply for two griffin cavalry to be stationed in Flying Bear's Fort. If there is a situation, we can contact immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Harley replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These problems are far beyond his authority, even beyond the authority of Marshal Hodge. All he can do is report it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the dignitaries in the royal capital who made the final decision. Even two Griffin cavalry need to apply to Marshal Hodge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"All right!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson nodded and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Something is better than nothing, although only two griffin cavalry were fooled for the time being, that was a good start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main duty is to strengthen communication, and it is feasible to go out occasionally to investigate the enemy's situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are few aerial scouts, so use them as a baby. It is not extravagant to find out the detailed intelligence of the enemy, as long as the enemy's movement is determined at the critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson became more and more enthusiastic about the idea of ​​forming an air force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, this is not a problem that you can have if you want to or not. Not to mention an individual, even if it is a country, it is very difficult to build an air force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest problem is that flying monsters are hard to find. They are all flying in the sky, and the probability of being captured alive is very low; even less can be domesticated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, they can only plan for the eggs of monsters, and take them back to find a way to incubate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the human race, the most widely used is the Griffin Cavalry. It's not that the Griffon Cavalry has the strongest combat effectiveness, it's mainly because the hatching success rate of Griffin eggs is higher than other monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is a high-level flying monster. Even if you get their eggs, it is difficult to hatch them, let alone mass-produce them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, this is a long road, and what is needed is accumulation. Even if the Warcraft is hatched, it will be difficult to use it in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Often the formation of an air force requires the efforts of several generations. To reproduce and expand, the financial, manpower, and material resources needed to be invested are all astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Far water can't quench thirst, Hudson can only temporarily abandon redundant thoughts, and hope that the power of the human race alliance can solve the threat in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eastern defense line of the Warhammer Kingdom, except for the orc army who came to test the defense line of Fort Augustus at the beginning of the collapse, these days have been calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was unbelievably quiet. If it weren't for the fact that the diplomats of the Warhammer Kingdom had been active outside, it would have been almost overlooked that they were also one of the protagonists of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc army doesn't invade, the Warhammer Kingdom doesn't dare to take the initiative to do things. Apart from the continuous expansion of the army, all that's left is to strengthen the defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, it is the outrageous low-keyness of the Warhammer Kingdom that has created the current tragedy of the Principality of Moxie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had learned from the Alpha Kingdom, after the orc army turned around and turned to the Principality of Moxi, they would make troubles on the border every now and then, the current situation would definitely be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if they really did this, the Principality of Moxi might indeed be saved, but they might be the ones who were hammered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, the allies are beaten, and on the other hand, they are beaten. This multiple choice question is easy to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is somewhat immoral, between countries, it is not possible to make a living by relying on morality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peaceful years will be broken one day. At some point, Duke Daniel's tent suddenly appeared at the border between the Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a few guards, he strolled low-key on the border, measuring the mountain, the water, and the place with his feet, like a low-level orc officer patrolling the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of the Warhammer Kingdom did not come out to stop the scene that was not surprising. It's not that the officers and soldiers on the front line didn't have bloodshed, it's mainly because the kingdom suddenly ordered them not to provoke border conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it was just after the Terran Alliance made the decision to go to war against the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, although the Warhammer Kingdom was equally low-key, under the pressure of its allies, it still went out every now and then to kill a few orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden stop now is naturally because the danger is about to be lifted, and the original Triple Alliance has become tasteless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing on the standpoint of Warhammer Kingdom, this is definitely the most correct choice. Only by preserving strength in the early stage of the war can it be possible to reap enough benefits for the kingdom later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, for the high-level leaders of the Warhammer Kingdom, as long as they don't continue to be neighbors with the orcs, it doesn't matter even if they get nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom wants to regain lost ground, no problem. As the best allies, they have absolutely full support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason. Since they became neighbors with the orcs, their daily military expenditures have tripled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not over yet. Under the harassment of orcs, many lands in the border area were forced to be abandoned, and many provinces in the north were not peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the current war, it seems that the Warhammer Kingdom has not lost much. In fact, from the day the war broke out, the rich and powerful men in the kingdom have rarely been able to sleep well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy may come over at any time, and the days without coming are often the most tormenting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Need to be vigilant all the time, suppressed for a long time, and seeing the tragedy of the Principality of Moxi, the top management of the Warhammer Kingdom has become more conservative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of restraint and show of favor falls into the eyes of the orc executives as cowardice. In the Orc Empire, only the weak need to humble themselves, and the strong disdain this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a certain distance in the defense line, Duke Daniel suddenly stopped, and said indifferently: \"There is no need to continue, the cowards in the Warhammer Kingdom are well prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defense line has not yet been completed, it is difficult to break through in a short time with what we see now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance has stepped in, and we don't have much time left, so we can't spend it here with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Subpoena to the imperial court, I support the attack on the Kingdom of Warhammer. However, the places to break through must be chosen by me personally. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are inconsistencies, the accompanying envoy of the Silver Moon Wolf Emperor will be completely surrounded. However, due to the majesty of Duke Daniel, he could only force himself to suppress his doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Duke of Cold Face\" is not called for nothing. Unless this person is willing, no matter who he is facing, he will not explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, such an arrogant person should not be able to get along in the imperial court, but the final result every time proved that Duke Daniel's judgment was correct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Silver Moon Imperial Court, which worships the strong, Duke Daniel, who has outstanding abilities, quickly stood out from his peers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a person continues to succeed, his rebellious character is no longer a shortcoming, but will be regarded as the unique temperament of the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't ask why, just say it's natural. In the big orc empire, there are not many good-tempered strongmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Duke Daniel was extraordinarily cold and arrogant, and he was unwilling to buy anyone's account, but he was too good at fighting if he couldn't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking stock of past achievements, no one in the Silver Moon Imperial Court can compare, even if you look at the entire Orc Empire, there is no one comparable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Military God\" who was killed with a knife and a gun was naturally worshiped by everyone. His status in the Silver Moon Imperial Court also went up with the tide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in addition to personal ability, Duke Daniel's background is also a plus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the precious son of the contemporary Silver Moon Wolf Emperor, he has been the favored son of heaven since he was a child. Others want to suppress, but they don't have the courage to take action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One minute late, no problem\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After receiving the order from the capital, all the defenders on Terence's defense line moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the outcome of the battle, as long as the defenders move, it will be a restraint on the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to ensure the safety of the logistics line, the orcs also had to send more troops to escort. Some active generals were on the most wanted list of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this has no meaning other than venting hatred. Originally, the two sides are mortal enemies, who cares about the wanted order of the Orc Empire!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the guard of Flying Bear Castle, Hudson is still on the list even though he didn't do much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the people under him are too professional. All the sons of nobles from the north have their ancestral craftsmanship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were able to obtain titles. In addition to the legacy of their ancestors, this skilled craftsmanship also played a big role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few years ago, when they went south from the north to seal off, the private troops brought over one by one were fed by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he is still doing his old job, but the original business was to go to the orc empire to catch slaves, but now it has become a problem for the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army looks huge, but it is actually composed of tribes. In terms of internal organization and coordination, it is far inferior to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is still hatred among many neighboring tribes. There are a lot of contradictions between different races. Being able to gather together is purely the pressure of the five imperial courts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there is contradiction, there is opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't know exactly what happened, and he wasn't interested in getting to the bottom of it. Anyway, he just asked his subordinates to cause some trouble for the orcs, and then he was listed at the top of the most wanted list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The furious performance of the beast not only failed to frighten Hudson, but aroused his greater interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't come to the door with a large army, didn't he just tell him clearly: the strength of the troops is tight, and I can't take care of his bad luck for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't use the opportunity, it will be automatically invalidated when it expires. The consumption of multi-line combat will be unbearable to anyone who puts it on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the core strategy of the orcs is to besiege the city of Dapace. If they mobilize 200,000 to 300,000 troops to besiege the Fort of Flying Bear, it will definitely affect the overall strategic layout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the Human Race Alliance likely to send troops at any time, the top management of the Orc Empire had to consider the time effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is completely clear at a glance whether pulling out a nail or destroying a country is more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs don't want to be brutally beaten, the only way is to drag more aliens to end and share the pressure together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what they need is not to strengthen local control, but to make as much noise as possible to prove to the outside world that the overlord of the human race is corrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl, just received the news from the spies that a large orc convoy has returned from the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spies checked behind the convoy and found that there were deep wheel marks on the ground, which should be full of cargo. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing \"Come back from the front\", Hudson was instantly interested. The army of orcs slaughtered all directions. In addition to the wanton killings, there were also burglaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the convoys transporting food and grass to the front line, these convoys full of loot are the real fat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the number of such fleets is rare. When they knew they were invincible, the nobles of the human race would usually destroy their property in order not to take advantage of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the time, what the orc army can loot is too late to destroy, or in other words, there is no way to destroy property.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Painful people, God pays off. After telling his subordinates to pay attention for so long, Hudson finally let Hudson wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, notify the expeditionary force to assemble, and order the Griffon Cavalry to wander around the sky and check from a distance to see if there is an enemy ambush nearby.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although fat meat is good, it is necessary to be vigilant. The logistics line is often harassed, and the orcs have become cunning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many defenders obviously went out to rob the orcs for food, but because they were not careful enough in their actions, they ended up becoming food for the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can successfully withdraw the troops are all veterans on the battlefield. More troops have paid a big price for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the failure of the operation is a failure. Hudson has not heard of a case of annihilation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these noble generals who have dealt with orcs for a while have become mature now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was very vigilant, and when they sensed something was wrong, they immediately led the troops out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has self-knowledge, like a newly formed legion whose combat effectiveness has been overwhelmed, they will never be taken out to give away their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troops that can participate in the operation, even if they are not elite divisions, are mostly veterans and semi-elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the orcs' main force is limited at the moment, and there are too many places that need to be taken into account. A large part of the army responsible for carrying out the ambush mission is miscellaneous soldiers, and their real combat effectiveness is not very strong, so everyone did not suffer much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's operation this time is no exception, and he only takes out troops that can fight. The city defense corps and the newly formed 23rd corps, which had been defeated in combat effectiveness, were all left in the city, and they definitely didn't want to eat alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Second Army and Third Army, whose combat effectiveness is a mystery, and have just been restored, they only mobilized some officers and soldiers to participate in the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it was just an ordinary robbery, and there was no need for too many troops at all. Taking action with tens of thousands of soldiers and horses, the task of most soldiers is not to rob, but to prepare for reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the orcs have a lot of troops stationed nearby, at a certain point, there are not many mobile troops that can be immediately dispatched for reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, the best way to stand out is—military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more exploits you have in your hands, the tougher you can speak. This is the only opportunity for the small and medium-sized nobles to transcend the limitations of their status and participate in the struggle for the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi is now in an era of turmoil. It would be a pity if the status of the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force is not used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Run to fight the orcs, Hudson is not so naive. It is still possible to lead the team to rob the orcs to make a fortune, and at the same time use the heads of the orcs to make military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The growth of a famous general is a long-term accumulation process. Except for a few famous battles, most of them are small battles, the key is to fight more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every battle is a qualification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A person who suddenly made great achievements and ascended to a high position will attract the envy of countless people; but after a person has gone through hundreds of battles, he will make another great contribution and rise to a high position, and everyone will only admire him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The silent rise of Moisture is widely accepted by the general public, because it is in line with everyone's cognition, and everyone is working **** this road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When someone succeeds, it just proves that they are on the right path. This kind of success is an example for everyone to learn from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly popping up, this kind of identity transition that does not conform to the rules of the game will naturally be attacked and suppressed by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this respect, Hudson is lucky. In the previous two big victories, Crown Prince Caesar was at the front, and the bundled political propaganda made it impossible for the jealous ones to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Hudson took over the expeditionary force, although he did not make great contributions, he did not stop making small contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going out every now and then to kill the orc number 180, I'm embarrassed to use it for publicity, but it's very good on my resume.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wanted warrant from the Orc Empire was a divine assist. Being able to become the most hated existence by the enemy, who would dare to say that his military exploits have no weight?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of enemies killed is small, it doesn't matter, just add a zero after it. Putting it on the battlefield between humans and orcs, killing a hundred and eighty enemies, and annihilating a thousand and eight hundred enemies is the same as nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make an approval, there is no way to do it. On this issue, the nobles in the army, big and small, have vested interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson never took the credit for beheading. Except for the credit for coordinating the command, the rest of the military credits were all on the heads of the nobles below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that the investigation of the fake leader's meritorious service, the first unlucky people will be the following people. Because the credit for the beheading can be quantified specifically, but it is difficult to have specific standards for the credit for the command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to investigation, the most direct charge is negligence, not pretending to be a military leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a small crime is not worth mentioning to any noble general with great military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he pick himself out, but more importantly, Hudson successfully created an image of a \"good leader who is not greedy for credit\", and incidentally tied the expeditionary force together with benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. If you don't use these methods, it is almost impossible to integrate an army with complex components in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The robbing team was gathering, and a quiet troop mobilization was slowly kicking off under the city of Dapace, more than 200 miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of orc camps is still increasing, but the number of elite legions appearing less and less, every siege battle is a large number of cannon fodder charging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite orcs who served as the supervising team also dropped from the initial tens of thousands to thousands of people, and a large number of main forces suddenly disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strange changes in the orc camp quickly attracted the attention of the defenders in the city. Reported all the way, and finally reached the hands of Prime Minister Herceg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With everyone's joint efforts, King Chris IX was finally rescued, but his body was still so weak that he couldn't come out to preside over the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether it's true or false. Anyway, Chris IX handed over the work of defending Dapez to a group of princes and ministers, and he stayed behind the scenes to concentrate on recuperating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Several elite orc legions outside the city seem to have disappeared out of thin air. Didn't you find it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that there are as many as eight main orc legions gathered under the city of Dapace. No matter where these elite legions point their troops, they can stir up a lot of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respected Prime Minister, the number of Ying people is dozens of times that of ours, and the orc army trapped us in the city before it was mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our Griffin Cavalry regiment sent people out several times to investigate, but in the end they never returned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we can be sure that the Beamon Legion of the Orcs has not been mobilized, and the Eagle Legion has left about two to three thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    About 6,000 Yingren soldiers and the main force of the other three imperial courts temporarily disappeared from our sight. Leaving with them, there are four ordinary werewolf cavalry regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are less than fifty griffin cavalry in the city. It is too risky to break through the enemy's blockade during the day, and it is best to wait until nightfall to act.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to receive information, you have to wait until tomorrow night at the earliest. If you want to be quick, maybe you can take some special measures to contact the surrounding nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc army will definitely pass through their territory. As long as you verify the location, you can roughly judge the enemy's purpose. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Campals said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the Griffin Cavalry, he has endured the most severe test every day since the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by the number of griffin cavalry, the Principality of Moxi has always used them as scouts. Even so, it still cannot change the reality of a large number of Griffon cavalry losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the eyes are closed and opened, there will be bad news. The number of griffin cavalry killed each time is not large, usually one or two cavalry is lost, the data is inconspicuous, but the problem is that it is difficult to replenish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the Principality of Moxi is raising griffins, but griffins are not hens that can lay eggs every day. The pitiful fertility, egg production is based on years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally laying a clutch of eggs, only one or two eggs can hatch out of more than a dozen eggs. This is not enough to guarantee that the little griffins will all grow up to adulthood safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not that I have tried other means to increase the hatching rate, but unfortunately it is limited by the law of the jungle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The artificially bred griffins have degenerated in many ways, and the griffins that are born will continue to degenerate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally a low-level monster, but after degenerating a few times, it became a beast directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat power of the Beast Griffin is irrelevant for now, but its strength is really not good enough, and it simply cannot carry a grown man to fly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to hatch artificially, you can only find wild griffin eggs. This kind of flying monsters that live in groups usually make their homes on the cliffs deep in the mountains of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to steal their eggs, you must first ask the monsters along the way if they would let you go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you are lucky, you won't even be able to see the shadow of the griffin egg, and it will directly turn into the feces of a monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long reproduction process + poor hatching rate restricts the growth of the Griffin Cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Griffin cavalry's individual combat effectiveness is obviously stronger than that of the Eagles, they are still always suppressed by the enemy. There is no way for eagles to kill griffins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, judging from the current situation, the situation in the Principality has actually deteriorated to the extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter where the orc army's goal is, there will be no essential difference in the impact on our situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning around and going back to besiege Terence's line of defense has no real meaning other than wasting time. The orcs will most likely not do such useless work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing to go south to occupy more of our territory, it would be worse than besieging Dapace, which would have a greater impact. As long as we take down our royal capital, the rest of the principality's territory will follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then the remaining choices, there are only a few neighbors left. It doesn't make much difference to the Principality whether the orcs choose to attack the Warhammer Kingdom or the Alpha Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Martins said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy pressure made the Minister of Military Affairs lose confidence and went down the road of being bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after changing the perspective, Martins, who was originally anxious, calmed down instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't stop the orc army's movement, then simply don't bother to stop it, as long as you keep Dapace well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the main force of the orcs suddenly disappeared, it still couldn't move him. With a calm mind, it is easier to analyze the problem to the point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, it is not completely unaffected. If we find out the movement of the orc army, we will know that we will call our allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the flames of war burn from our side to their doorsteps, but we don't notify them in time, it won't be a good time for everyone to meet in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Renato said depressingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to deal with it passively, but their foreign affairs department is in big trouble. Compared with the two neighbors, the strength of the Principality of Moxi is still so weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you offend someone to death, you will inevitably suffer in the future. Especially now that the strength of the two allies is still there, they have already been paralyzed by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, unless you can kill your teammates, it is best not to do it, so as not to plant hidden dangers for yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After the operation is successful, I will send out a signal, and I will lead troops out to meet you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson did not forget to make an expression that I am optimistic about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to be careless. The troops that can march at night are all carefully selected elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the success rate of the operation, Hudson had to reuse experienced Northland nobles. Even if we got along a little unhappy in the past, it will not affect the current cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other places are easy to handle. The most important thing is how to avoid the enemy's detection after dawn. This is very critical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although similar drills have been done, it is still a team of 3,000 people. If the traces are exposed, the orc transportation brigade will most likely become an encirclement and suppression army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured! As long as the orc transportation brigade arrives, I will definitely complete the task.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kelette said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to show their faces are rare, especially now that the positions of the two legion commanders are vacant, whoever can make great contributions first will grasp the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a baron, serving as a legion commander is rare in the entire history of the Alpha Kingdom. There is such an opportunity now, entirely because of the special situation of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to send new generals in the country, and the original commanders of the legions are guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The era when the expeditionary force determined its position by status is over, and Hudson clearly announced that the appointment of the next legion commander will only be based on military merit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a bit out of order, but given the current situation of the expeditionary force, this is already the best choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the team off, Hudson turned his attention to Bear Stearns, who had just returned from the investigation, and asked with concern: \"Is there any major change in the bear court?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to come out to do something, you must first find out the strength of the nearby enemies. The Flying Bear Castle is within the sphere of influence of the Royal Bear Court, so Hudson naturally has to pay attention to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I am very familiar with the breath of those bear cubs, there is no change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, the camps of the orcs have been increased, and a messy race has been added, such as foxes, stinky pigs' hoofs, dirty goblins... They are all useless goods, and you should be able to withstand them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, if you want me to say, you might as well bring someone to take over the bear court. In terms of numbers, the strength in your hands is not much less than theirs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' words made Hudson roll his eyes directly. If wars were only based on the number of people, the orc army would have been driven back to their hometown long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the transfer of two main armies to the south, except for one main army, the remaining few cannon fodder armies of the Xiongren Imperial Court have average combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength gap between the two sides is not very different. Initiating a decisive battle is likely to hurt both sides. This is why Hudson dares to continue to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If conditions permit, Hudson really doesn't mind taking away the bear court and adding a record in history to his resume.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, run away after the fight, and don't give the orc army a chance to retaliate. With such an outstanding record, losing Flying Bear Castle is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Bear Stearns, don't you think there are too many masters in the bear camp. Last time a certain bear passed by, but it almost got caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case we are stuck, the nearby orc army comes to help. Do you think the Moxi army hiding in the fortress can hold them back? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson unceremoniously revealed the shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since his debut, Bear Stearns has been going smoothly, and he is more like the protagonist than his master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his personality was influenced by Hudson during the growth process and became more stable, the supercilious arrogance in his bones still grew along with his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I walked a lot at night, but I still stepped on the pit after all. During a certain investigation into the Bearman Royal Camp, he was accidentally discovered by an orc master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides fought in the bear court, and at the beginning they took advantage of it, but in the face of the orcs' ignorant martial arts gang fights, Bear Stearns could only run in despair in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Xiong Sheng's dark history came out, Bear Stearns' good mood disappeared instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two bear eyes stared fiercely at Hudson, and a pair of bear paws kept rubbing on the ground, as if warning: Ben Xiong is going to be impatient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he still defended himself strongly: \"It was just that I was not prepared last time, so I fell into the way of those despicable and shameless people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You wait, after another hundred years, I will definitely go to them to settle accounts! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"One hundred years\", Hudson shut up decisively when he heard this number. It is really sad to be the enemy of the longevity race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not too late for a gentleman to take revenge for ten years, but Bear Stearns has started for a hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cub's current strength growth rate is followed, Hudson doubts very much that after a hundred years, it will be able to directly dismantle the bear royal court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, it's better not to offend the vengeful bear too deeply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, after hundreds of years, it would be embarrassing to go to his grave to **** and pee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky gradually brightened, and Flying Bear Castle became noisy again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gate of the city was suddenly opened, and Hudson led the cavalry team out of the city wall, scaring the surveillance eagle man to turn around and fly away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until the distance between the two sides was several miles away that they stopped in the air again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been a \"good\" neighbor for so long, the name of \"Knight of the Bow\" has already spread to the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all **** lessons that the companions sacrificed their lives for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that once it enters the range of the bow knight, no eagle can go back alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is the range of this range, no one knows the eagle. But anyone who dares to try has already grown grass on their graves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the strong of the Yingren clan, if they want to get rid of this threat, they will end up with hatred in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suffering losses one after another made Hudson, the \"Knight of the Bow\", almost bewildered the nearby Eagle soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the sponsorship of the Principality of Moxi and the gathering of the cavalry in the rout, Hudson finally managed to gather four cavalry regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First the cavalry came out, and then the infantry went out of the city, as if it was a daily necessary subject training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training ground is still a few miles away from the castle, and the land near the castle has become a vegetable garden for the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food can be stored, but fresh vegetables are difficult to store for a long time. It's okay to eat pickles once in a while, but noble gentlemen can't bear to eat them every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a vegetable garden in the castle, but it is replanted from the original garden, and the output is extremely limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know how long I will stick to it. After the war eased slightly, Hudson ordered to replant some fast-ripening vegetables outside the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The green vegetable field brings not only vegetables, but also hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no orcs came to do things, but they all turned into fertilizer in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was due to fear of the strength of the defenders. After the tentative confrontation, the Xiongren imperial court resolutely acquiesced that the territory within a radius of more than ten miles was Lord Hudson's territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the Leboron family. If they hadn't given Xiongren a wave of ruthlessness, Xiongrenhuang would never be as peaceful as he is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the sky, seeing the team resting on the spot after leaving the city, an Eagle soldier asked suspiciously:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jesus, something is wrong. Why are the human soldiers resting and not training?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jesus' Yingman rolled his eyes at his companion and said, \"Nonsense, I saw it too.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Cummins, what does it matter to us whether the human soldiers are trained or not?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe after a while, people will start training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you have to go back and report on such a trivial matter? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be a scout, not only to be able to obtain information, but also to have a certain ability to identify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you run back to report on trivial matters, there is a high probability that you will die of exhaustion on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cummins shook his head and couldn't help complaining: \"Of course not, this is the Fort of Flying Bear, and the strength of the defenders can catch up with Terence City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless even if they find out the problem, the cowards of the bear people have been frightened for a long time, and they dare not come to a decisive battle with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was under the jurisdiction of the Beamon royal family, no human army would dare to come out for training. Every time the Beamon cavalry appeared, the human soldiers were frightened...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't say that. The defenders of Flying Bear Castle are not ordinary people. It is said that they are all elites from the Alpha Kingdom, and they are not comparable to the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard that the Beamon cavalry suffered a loss in their hands last time. The Xiongren Emperor's Court now has the same strength as them, and it is really impossible to win a fight. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wheels pressed against the fallen leaves, making a continuous \"squeak\" sound, like a beautiful piece of music.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the **** officer of the convoy, Van Lumulov was in a particularly good mood. Escorting the booty back to the imperial court, this kind of good job was only won by him after defeating countless competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the deep rut marks, we can see how rich the harvest this time is. Sending it to the imperial court, rewards are definitely indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road ahead suddenly became difficult. The uneven road forced the carriage to slow down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This changed the face of Van Lumulov, who was eager to go back to claim credit, and sternly shouted at the escorting soldiers: \"What are you all doing in a daze, why don't you hurry over to push the cart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that there are human army activities nearby. If they run into it, it is unknown whether you will be able to go back alive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the whip in his hand also waved. Seeing that someone is not working hard, it is a whip to go up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know why, but the road ahead is becoming more and more difficult. It is already difficult to pull the carriage forward with horsepower alone, and more and more soldiers joined the cart team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Van Rumlov has traveled this road three times, and now it is the fourth time. Compared with the previous few times, this meeting is obviously much more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The uneven road surface and water accumulation in many areas are obviously the result of no maintenance for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is man-made damage, it is not destroyed now. There is no trace of ground breaking around, and Van Lumulov is very relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While pushing the cart, it is inevitable to let the soldiers build the road ahead. Relying on tinkering and working together with humans and animals, they finally passed the most difficult road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Van Lumulov, who was in a good mood, was considering whether to let everyone stop and have a rest. Suddenly, a voice came, which directly made him break out in a cold sweat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Head, the left flank has found a human army approaching us.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leader, the right wing discovered...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Leader, we found...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the enemy was coming from three sides, putting Van Lumulov under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to run. People can run away, but the convoy cannot. There are enemies on three sides, and the seemingly safe rear is a rough and uneven road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy made a move in this place, and it was obvious that they had scouted it in advance. Just as Van Lumulov was hesitating, the human army had already appeared in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Light the smoke, everyone takes up arms, surrounds the carriages, and relies on the convoy to defend!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment, Van Rumlov still showed the qualities that an **** officer should have, and made the most realistic decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deafening shouts of killing sounded on the plain, and countless crossbow arrows attacked the orc soldiers in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The car array provides good defense for the orc soldiers, but also limits their movement space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the overwhelming rain of arrows, the orc soldiers did not try to fight back. Unfortunately, the enemy used magic crossbows, but they held the most primitive bows and arrows in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in weapons and equipment made this battle an unequal position from the very beginning. After secretly cursing bad luck, Van Lumulov hurriedly ordered to the panicked soldiers:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, don't run around, go to the carriage and find something that can defend against arrows and put it on your head!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, a large shield appeared above Van Lumulov's head. It's a pity that not all orc soldiers are qualified to equip this kind of equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by productivity, even if they are soldiers in the elite army of the bear people, there are only a small number of soldiers who can get armor and shields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For most ordinary bear soldiers, it is considered lucky to be able to obtain a pair of leather armor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering an enemy's arrow, just take a wooden board to top it. This thing is much cheaper than expensive iron shields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short delay, the human army has already reached the front of the battle. The **** scene brought the charioteer to the verge of losing control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kill all the poor horses and destroy the wheels!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Van Rumlov ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be to stabilize the car formation, but in fact he has prepared for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy came too ferociously, and they were all elites. Only the soldiers who were escorted, the hope of keeping the convoy was very slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What can be done now is to use the car array to deal with the enemy, delaying the time as much as possible, and waiting for the reinforcements to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the resistance fails and there is no carriage available, it will be difficult for the enemy to take away the property on the carriage in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the scene in front of him, Baron Kelette ordered with a gloomy face: \"Knight Holman, send a signal to the Earl that we need carriage support. Everyone else, follow me to kill these bastards!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Kelette is really angry. This move had been prevented a long time ago, but the worst scenario finally happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officer who escorted the convoy behaved too simply, destroying the carriage just after the battle started, and did not give him a chance to stop it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no ready-made carriage available, then the only option is to activate the backup plan and let the prepared carriage team take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, it takes a lot of time to reverse the materials, and for the team executing the robbery plan, the risk has increased several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rising smoke quickly attracted the attention of the Eagle soldiers patrolling nearby. After sensing the big battle below, he did not wait for the slightest hesitation, and immediately passed the news to the bear camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, Hudson also received the signal. Although there are no eagle soldiers to summon, he can set up temporary beacon towers along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only necessary to leave a few sentries every ten miles, and when they find their own wolf smoke ignited, they will light the special magic wolf smoke cake in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It only takes a few transfers to pass the message back. It is even possible to make an agreement in advance, and pass some simple messages through the number of wolf smoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, take the carriage team to meet him, and the rest will attack with my army!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While giving the order, Hudson had already stepped on the horse. Appearing at the forefront of the team, he took out the knight sword and pointed out the direction for the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Four thousand cavalry and twenty thousand infantry, fully armed, embarked on the journey. It can be said that for this battle, Hudson took out all his assets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In field battles, the more troops the better. Rather than carrying a lot of cannon fodder, it is more convenient to only bring the elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation of the battle is at a stalemate, you can still call the younger brothers to come over and act as the last straw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to jump out at this time, the main reason is that there is only one main army of the bear royal court, which is an infantry army, and the number of cavalry is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less cavalry does not mean weak combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Behemoth heavy cavalry is the king of the cavalry world, then the Bearman heavy infantry is the king of the infantry, and they all have the reputation of being the best in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Showing his sword to such an enemy is not because Hudson is arrogant, but because he already has calculations in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before thinking about victory, think about defeat first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heavy infantry is powerful, but it also has a fatal weakness, that is, it moves slowly. The bulky armor is also not a small burden on the strong bear soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such an enemy, even if you can't beat it, you can still run past it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risk of failure is manageable, then all that remains is victory. War is gambling, and when the odds of winning are high enough, bets must be made decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearman Emperor's Court just ordered the rescue of the transport convoy when they received the news that the army from Flying Bear Fort came out, and the Bear Emperor's bear temper was also aroused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Asshole, I really thought that the emperor was afraid that he would fail!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno Army Commander, the army of Flying Bear Castle is entrusted to you. Commander of the Boggs Corps and the Commander of the Nonandez Corps, you are in charge of leading the troops and following along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't care how you arrange it, in short, you must show the prestige of my bear clan. If we want the people to be scared when they hear our name, it is best to destroy the elite of the Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commander Raoul, you lead people to detour and rescue our transport team. No matter what you encounter along the way, don't get entangled with the Terran army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Xiong Renhuang's voice fell, several legion leaders were dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the Bruno Legion hastily stepped forward to persuade him: \"Your Majesty, if so many troops are dispatched at one time, there will only be one ordinary legion left in the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think it is better to leave 2,000 heavy infantry, and the other three legions each leave half of their strength to ensure the safety of the imperial court. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, the only thing nearby that can pose a threat to us is the human army in Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest are frightened birds. They make small moves on weekdays, and everyone is timid. How dare you come and act wild in my imperial court!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it really comes, a defender of an ordinary legion is enough to hold on until you return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, if you don't have enough troops, I'm afraid you won't be able to take down the human army in Flying Bear Castle. According to the collected information, the Earl of Hudson is a very difficult opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to jump out now, you must rely on something. If you are not prepared enough, it is easy to suffer a big loss. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to allocate troops like this, he naturally has confidence. In addition to the army, there are many masters accompanying the army in the Xiongren Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is all the wealth accumulated by the Xiongren clan painstakingly. In order to prevent the beheading attack by the human race masters, he brought out many masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some reason, the thought of Xiong Renhuang felt a pain in the flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First lost more than a dozen masters in the Bethel Fortress, and was attacked by a mysterious earth bear not long ago, and unfortunately lost a few people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this way of playing, I am afraid that before the end of the war, his heritage of the Xiongren Imperial Court will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly felt that the masters cultivated by the imperial court at a great cost should not be allowed to participate in the war of attrition. It's just that the words have already been spoken, and Xiong Renhuang is too embarrassed to take them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If we take a detour, not to mention an additional 30 miles, the road is still winding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are 10,000 infantry in the center, 5,000 infantry on each of the two wings, and 4,000 cavalry cruising beyond the two wings, a total of 24,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army dressed in armor and tied with red scarves, under the sunlight, looks like a maple forest in autumn, fiery red.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A burst of loud and urgent horns, the orc army appeared in the sky, the blackness was like a pine forest all over the field, but the formation was much more chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the formation alone, it doesn't look like an elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as the bear army in the central army, it still aroused Hudson's idea. Although the pace was a little messy, the big man wearing the armor was not easy to mess with at first glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the bear soldiers who are generally 2.34 meters tall and weigh 400 pounds, the expeditionary soldiers whose average height is less than 1.7 meters are really a comparison between beasts and...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stone hammer, this is the first heavy infantry in the mainland. With this physique and tonnage, if it can't be regarded as the number one in the mainland, then it has to be replaced by a giant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the giant race has withdrawn from the mainland stage long ago, and now the number of remaining giants is extremely limited, so they can only settle in a corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two armies with very different styles met on the plain. Suddenly, drums and horns blared, and flags fluttered in the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Strike!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by Hudson's order, the cavalry cruising outside took the lead and marched towards the cannon fodder army of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The infantry strode forward in neat steps, like a mountain wall, shouting \"kill\" every three steps, and moved forward calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Commander Bruno's face changed slightly, and he quickly returned to nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The physique of the bear people is destined to be natural infantry. As for the cavalry, don't embarrass the bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on their tonnage and armor, the weight can easily exceed 500 pounds, and the fragile war horses cannot bear all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps elephants are more suitable for them. In the era when orcs dominated the mainland, the bear people had a prestigious elephant army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, with the decline of the orc hegemony, the elephant cavalry of the bear clan also disappeared, and even the domesticated elephant herd was wiped out by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, the cavalry has become a shortcoming of the bear people, and they can only focus on the development of infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the Bruno army knows, the imperial court has secretly formed a new cavalry regiment, but the scale is not too large, and it has not been involved in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Army attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignore the enemy cavalry, this is Bruno's final choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the history of the bear people, they were only broken by the Beamon cavalry once, and the human cavalry was obviously not qualified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the two cannon fodder legions, if they can hold back the elite cavalry of the human race, they have completed their respective missions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shrill sound of horns shook the ground, and the cavalry of the Expeditionary Army, who roared to meet them, suddenly turned to abandon the army and went straight to the rear of the orc army when they approached the camp of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flanking back and forth?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Bruno realized that something was wrong. The human cavalry did not attack them, but rushed all the way towards the imperial camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Oops!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Bruno Jun's face suddenly darkened. What's the use of defeating the elite of the human race in front of you if you lose the royal camp?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send an order to let the Eagleman go out to investigate and see if the human army in the nearby fortress has been dispatched!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the two armies collided like mountains and seas, like thunder resounding through the valley, and like a raging wave hitting the mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long swords and scimitars clanged and danced, spears and spears whizzed and flew, dense arrows rained like locusts, and the dull shouts and short roars made the mountains and rivers tremble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two elite armies fought fiercely on the plain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Iron men collided, death never came, ferocious faces, **** swords, deep howls, filled with smoke and dust, the entire plain was shrouded and annihilated by the tragic atmosphere of this primitive fighting...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that his own troops suffered from this round of flesh and blood collision, Hudson immediately ordered: \"Everyone shout with me, go straight to the bear emperor's court, and capture the bear emperor alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go straight to the bear emperor's court, and capture the bear emperor alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go straight to the bear emperor's court, and capture the bear emperor alive!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overwhelming shouts were actually shouted in the language of the bear tribe. Although the pronunciation is not so standard, it is enough for all bear soldiers to understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The astonishing cry shocked the hearts of the bear soldiers in the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terran cavalry is gone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shock in my heart was reflected on the battlefield, and the pace under my feet inevitably slowed down a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is fighting on the battlefield is a breath of blood. Once the breath is vented, it will be difficult to revive it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the rout was unlikely, the opportunity to defeat the expeditionary army in one go was lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides fought fiercely together, but Bruno, as the main general, was suffering a lot in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side is the battlefield, the other side is the imperial court, it is really difficult to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the two army commanders had already arrived in front of Bruno, and Nonandez was the first to pick up the topic:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"General Bruno, the enemy deliberately lured us out, obviously for the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tried to drag us here and launch a sneak attack while the imperial court was empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps at this moment, the nearby human army has all come out of the fortress and launched a siege to the imperial court! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Commander of the Nonandez Legion, I have sent the Eagles out to investigate, and news will come back soon.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He said so on the lips, but deep down in his heart, Bruno didn't think that the human race would give up this good opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an ordinary army stationed in the imperial court, and there are many masters accompanying him. If it is just the defenders in the nearby human fortresses, he is not too worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now that 4,000 more elite cavalry have joined, everything has changed. It is clear that this is deliberately done by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it was well prepared to gather a group of human masters and take the opportunity to attack the Xiong Renhuang, it is not surprising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After guessing the conspiracy of the human race, Bruno became more and more embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the two sides have fought together, they failed to defeat the enemy in one go, and it was obvious that the winner could not be determined for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the order to retreat is given, the human army is bound to follow behind and catch up. A little carelessness and a retreat can turn into a rout.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"General Bruno, the safety of the imperial court is of the utmost importance. Before there is still time, hurry up and bring your troops back to aid the imperial court!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the enemy army in front of us, leave it to us. Even if you can't beat them, you can still hold them back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the Boggs Corps offered to cut off the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is the head of the motley army, he is also from the bear family. In a critical moment, the first consideration is the interests of the Xiongren clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial court fell, and not only the 10,000 defenders in the camp were lost, but also a group of high-ranking royal families in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all the high-level executives escaped smoothly, the political horror and disaster would still hurt the Xiongren clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is much more serious than losing a main force before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Bruno could make a decision, the Hawkman had already brought news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"During our investigation, we found a large number of human troops in the southeast direction, moving towards the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the marching team, there are no less than 20,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not yet known which unit it is. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno was about to speak when another eagle soldier fell from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The defenders of Fort Landry came out. The target seems to be in the direction of our royal court. The long line is several miles away...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last straw that crushed the inner balance appeared, and Bruno didn't care about delay any longer, and immediately ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order sounded, and Ming Jin withdrew the troops. The bear army followed me back to rescue the imperial court!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Boggs Corps Commander, Nonnandez Corps Commander, you are responsible for leading people to stop the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the enemy must be held back for at least two hours, and they cannot be allowed to join the siege of the imperial court! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The call to withdraw troops sounded, and the bear soldiers who were fighting fiercely left their opponents and wanted to leave the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally waiting for the fighter plane, how could Hudson be relentless, and immediately ordered: \"The orcs are defeated, we can't let them run away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether anyone believed it or not, the guards around him shouted, and then all the soldiers shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time it is not the language of the bear people, but the most widely spread common language of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many people can understand, Hudson does not know. Anyway, there is no loss in shouting a few times, there are always a few stupid orcs in so many orcs, one by one is counted as one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For these few words, he spent half a month promoting them in the army before the soldiers remembered them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that there are really many fools these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the shouts and seeing the bear soldiers retreating, the two orc legions that were originally in charge of the rear fell into chaos first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back quickly, the human race lied to you, you idiots!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The supervising team will be killed, and those who retreat without authorization will be executed!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two army commanders who were in charge of breaking the rear shouted with all their might.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the supervisory team can kill sporadic deserters, but it can't stop the army in chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first to be affected was the orderly retreat of the bear army. The chaotic allies were running around, and many people broke into their army formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original rear army changed to the front army retreating in an orderly manner, and under the impact of the allies, they directly made a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the bear soldiers are well-trained, not every brain is bright. It's okay to act with the army, once you fall into chaos, start to catch blind at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Bruno, the general, was directly blown away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the chaotic army, like flies without a head, began to scurry around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers cannot find the soldiers, and the soldiers cannot find the officers directly under them. Everyone is acting on instinct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pig teammate, it's really hard to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The retreat turned into a rout. If he had known this earlier, he would not have let the two cannon fodder corps participate in the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by experience. In the past, the bear army was the core, and the cannon fodder army served as the wings. Once the enemy's army was torn apart, the massacre could be carried out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was indeed the case during the early battles. Following the bear army, the two legions held back the human army on both wings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that they failed to tear up the expeditionary army's formation immediately, bringing the war into a stalemate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the coach ordered the retreat, the pig teammates' talent for pitting their teammates would reach the peak without a teacher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bear army, the first heavy infantry in the mainland, was not defeated by the enemy, but lost its temper after being tossed by teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the bear army got rid of the entanglement with the human race, Bruno's face turned green when he saw that there were only more than 6,000 people left in the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the midst of the chaotic army, **** back your own elite, not to mention whether the human soldiers agree, the key is that the time does not allow it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information received, there are tens of thousands of ethnic troops going straight to the imperial court, and it is unknown how many enemies have not been found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you stay here for a long time, what will happen to your hometown?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the chaotic battlefield, Bruno gritted his teeth and ordered cruelly, \"Go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rebellious armies are everywhere, even if he lets the bear army join the battle again, it will be difficult to reverse the decadent battle situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stay and fight to the death, the best ending is that both sides will suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the bear man was fooled, Hudson secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war is a gamble on the judgment of the opposing commander. If the opposing commander stays and dies regardless, the expeditionary force should run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to play this big show, he mobilized all the nearby human defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The movement of the army to the orc royal court is naturally true. It's just besieging the orc royal court, but it's not within the scope of everyone's agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson's layout is not perfect, it's just that I didn't expect the plan to be so smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that mobilizing the main force of the bears to return to aid, taking advantage of the situation to eat some orc miscellaneous soldiers, and adding a brilliant record of defeating the bears to his resume, it was enough to show off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't expect the enemy to be so arrogant. They thought they were 100% victorious when they came up. In order to reduce the loss of the main force, even the cannon fodder army was sent out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't even expect the two orc cannon fodder legions to be so powerful. At the critical moment when the bear legion retreated, they directly filled up the skills of the pit teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fake record that he wanted to pretend to be fake suddenly turned into a real record, and Hudson's head was buzzing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the seriously downsized bear army that left the battlefield, Hudson suddenly realized that he seemed to be playing big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A new idea suddenly appeared in his mind, should he take advantage of the victory and pursue it, and simply destroy the bear royal court?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a thought arises, it never goes away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fighter planes did appear, and the main army closest to the Bearman Royal Court was already severely weakened at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two cannon fodder corps on the battlefield were able to evacuate one-third of the soldiers back, and that was already blessed by the beast god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the number of troops staying in the Bearman Royal Court must not exceed two cannon fodder legions. Looking at the tense appearance of the enemy guards, there might be even fewer troops left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human race troops from all directions were gathered together to launch a joint siege, it might not be impossible to take down the Bearman Emperor's Court before the reinforcements from the Four Great Emperor's Courts arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if the allies are notified, it is still unknown who will reach the destination first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more than 6,000 elite bear infantry, even if it is a tired army, it is not easy to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His main force is still entangled with the remnants of the orcs, and they will not be able to catch up for a while. With the strength of his allies alone, Hudson really has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has witnessed the destructive power of the pig teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the allies are not strong enough to turn the game over for the Xiongren Royal Court, the hard-won achievements in the past will also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the nearby defenders have no record, even if it is a bragging record, they can't show it. There is really no reason for Hudson to trust it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the \"flying bear\" on the ground is extraordinary. In a blink of an eye, Hudson ran in front of the bear infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The savage Bear Stearns took Hudson and passed directly over the heads of the bear army. The bear's paws crackled and slapped fiercely, and countless unlucky bear people met the beast **** in advance without knowing what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the bear knight, Master Hudson was naturally not idle, throwing the magic he knew on the ground for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It rains hail for a while, fireballs fall from the sky for a while, pierces the ground for a while, and fog grows for a while...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of magic you encounter depends entirely on luck. Anyway, they just throw them around as they please, and those who hit them are all unlucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scariest thing was that the bear warrior who had seen the beast **** climbed up from the ground again, picked up the weapon and slashed the butcher knife at his former comrades in arms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A bunch of instant magic was thrown around, and those who didn't know it thought it was throwing a magic scroll. Under normal circumstances, without the cultivation base of a great magister, it is impossible to achieve this speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this kind of magic of various departments competing to appear first, which has never been heard in the continent of Aslante. Who is the great magister of all departments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the great magisters of the whole department, even the magicians of the whole department have never appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you insist on saying there is, it can only be the omnipotent **** in the legend. Anyway, they are all legends, and no one has seen them with their own eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chaotic scene made the Bearman infantry, whose morale was already low, become even more agitated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time they reacted, one person and one bear had long since disappeared into the sky. Hundreds of people were lost without even touching the enemy's shadow. Bruno almost fainted from anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this kind of enemy who comes and goes without a trace is the most troublesome. If you want to take revenge, you don't know how to start. .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Despicable villain! You don't have the air of a strong man at all, it's just...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The endless cursing still doesn't help. One person and one bear that disappeared from sight had already gone far away and could not be heard at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strong attitude, that is a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson is not a strong man in the first place, so where does he come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Bear Stearns, as a four or five-year-old cub, he is at the most naughty age, and he has no concept of being strong at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a vengeful bear, Bear Stearns has not forgotten the last time he was besieged by bears. Even the forward route was chosen exactly the same as that of the Bearman Legion, and it was obvious that they wanted to vent their anger on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the main army, Bruno's strength is naturally not weak. But compared with Bear Stearns, there is still a long way to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He yelled fiercely, but his body still stopped in place very honestly, and he didn't catch up for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He also personally participated in the siege of Bear Stearns that day. I have witnessed several masters of the same level who are only slightly weaker than him, have their heads blown away by the bear's paw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the large number of people and the power of the crowd, I am afraid that the royal court of the Xiongren would be turned upside down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said that there is no gain at all. Combined with the battle just now, Bruno has locked the suspicion on Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the information does not match. According to the data, Hudson's mount bear is just a newly grown earth bear, and its strength should not be so strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is understandable that the skin is strong and resistant to beatings. The defense of the Earth Bear is already high. The problem is that the strong magic power is simply not something that a bear that has just grown up can accumulate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bruno can only choose to accept that his strength is not up to par. Ninety-nine percent of people will never meet the Earth Bear, a rare creature comparable to a giant dragon, let alone sign a contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, one man and one bear caught up with the cavalry. At this moment, the cavalry regiment is launching a feint attack on the Xiongren imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two ways in front of Hudson, either take it and leave immediately with the team; or turn into a feint attack and use the only four cavalry regiments in his hand to forcibly attack the bear royal court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the camp of the Royal Bear Court, the number of defenders was smaller than expected, and Hudson suddenly felt that he could work hard again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Four thousand elite cavalry against 10,000 orc cannon fodder, theoretically, the chances of winning are still very high. The only question is when reinforcements from the Ursine Court will arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal clans of the orcs are full of conflicts, and it is not uncommon to dig pits and toss each other's teammates, but it does not mean that everyone has lost the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Xiongren imperial court falls, it is not a trivial matter to deceive teammates, but a tragedy to deceive oneself together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Human Race Alliance has declared war on the Beastman Empire, and the time has come for survival. If they don't unite, the Beastman Clan will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, once the orc empire shows decadence, the nations of the human race will definitely flock to them and wipe them out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"clearance\" operation before the catastrophe is no longer an ordinary racial war, but has risen to the height of racial strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weaker the orc empire is, the more hesitant potential allies will be; on the contrary, the stronger the performance, the easier it is to win the support of all races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, look for an opportunity to destroy the orc camp.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much time left for him, so naturally he can only use the most convenient way. As for the exposure of Bear Stearns, that is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs are not stupid. Even if there is no perfect intelligence system among the human race, they can still arrest a few nobles and go back to extract confessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few people who regard death as their own. Under torture, there will always be someone who can't bear it and confesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in the camp, Xiong Renhuang, who witnessed the battle with his own eyes, was already blown out of anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own troops only left the door in the morning, and the enemy came over in the afternoon. If he didn't know that he had been tricked, he would have lived in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just the cavalry in front of them has caused them enough trouble. If there are human troops coming from behind, the imperial court will definitely not be able to defend it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of life and death, life is more important than face, Xiong Renhuang can only lower his face and ask for help everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the five imperial courts all have their own defense zones, and the distance between them is no less than a hundred miles. The reinforcements closest to them were the troops that had just been dispatched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Did you find Bruno?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the Yingman descending from the sky, Emperor Xiongren asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Found it, just...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Yingren's faltering, Xiongrenhuang became very angry. If it wasn't a scout borrowed from the Eagle Court, he would have slapped him long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear temper is short-tempered. Before Yingren could finish speaking, Emperor Xiongren interrupted forcefully:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's just what it is, hurry up and say it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, General Bruno is rushing back with the team, and will arrive at the imperial court in two hours.,\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the state of the army is not very good, it looks like it has lost a battle, and the total strength is only about 6,000…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Xiong Renhuang's face gradually darkened, Yingren decisively chose to shut up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it if you don't want to listen, he is not a soldier of the Xiongren Emperor's Court. If the big camp can't hold it, just flap your wings and leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a cold snort, the furious Xiongrenhuang was about to go mad when he suddenly heard a loud noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defensive facilities set up at the gate of the camp were suddenly destroyed by a giant bear more than ten meters high. The masters in the camp were about to intercept it, and the cavalry team rushed in following the gap opened by the giant bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An elderly priest walked up to Xiong Renhuang and persuaded him: \"Your Majesty's camp may be dangerous, so you should take a break first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for the army to return, and then settle with these human troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he was caught off guard, and couldn't use many methods of the Xiongren Imperial Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is in their lair, let alone 4,000 human cavalry, even 40,000 human cavalry may not be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, the camp cannot give up. No matter what, we must hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not only related to the face of our bear clan, but also determines our status in the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cast the secret method, even if I abandon this legion in the camp, I can't retreat! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Xiong Renhuang said made the old priest very speechless. The reason why Xiong Renhuang retreated was for the convenience of using the secret technique.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, they are all within the coverage of the secret technique, and the Xiongren Emperor is also affected by the secret technique. Wouldn't it be bad to rush out with a weapon to fight the enemy bloody.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, why don't you take your guards and retreat to the rear camp first, so as not to be affected by the secret technique.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old priest hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that he had misunderstood, Xiong Renhuang smiled awkwardly, and walked back to the camp silently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to let him be a deserter. Among the bear people, there is no bear king who left the camp to escape. Even if you want to leave, it is also a strategic shift.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without worries, the mysterious battle song suddenly sounded in the camp. The orc soldiers whose morale was low and were beaten steadily were revived with full blood after hearing the battle song.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The red eyes and the green forehead are extraordinarily pervasive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that something was wrong, Hudson hurriedly summoned Bear Stearns to stop it, but the orc masters in the camp stood in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a delay, the secret art of orc sacrifice was completed. All the efforts were in vain, and Hudson was also full of anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention capturing the Bear Emperor alive, just breaking the record of the Bear Emperor Court will send him to the ranks of famous generals in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You just need to be steady in the future. After the war, there is still a great chance for a real earl.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this kind of thing still depends on the opportunity. In this era of one radish and one hole, the credit is only second, and the key is to have a hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the existing rules of the game, if no unowned counties appear, no amount of credit will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the king can give is a bunch of false titles. For example, seal off the land of the orc empire without money, and take it by yourself if you have the ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to go deeper, you will find that the old lair of the Orc Empire has been entrusted by the kings of the Alpha Kingdom more than a dozen times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent the proliferation of titles, the feudal lords cannot be granted titles, and the titles are all at the end of one generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is left to future generations is only a glorious history that can be used as a pretense, and then laments the bad luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of the arrow piercing through the air told Hudson's full of anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"ah!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A scream came from the orc sacrifice, and three of the four arrows were blocked, and only one achieved the result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had no time to verify the results of the battle, Hudson, who had exposed his position, decisively flashed away and hid himself in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jim, ask the people below to record in detail with the photo stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the high-level officials of the Xiongren Royal Court must appear on the screen. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered to his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter how you say it, the great achievement of attacking the Xiongren Emperor's Court cannot be given up in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Record the battle scene, maybe when the kingdom is propagandizing, it will be beautified for political needs, and it will become the conquering of the Bearman Royal Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of exaggerated achievement has gone through two rounds before, and Hudson is also familiar with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that there is no Crown Prince Caesar in the front this time, otherwise it will not only be possible, but will definitely become \"conquering the bear court\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bloodthirsty orcs desperately blocked the advance of the cavalry, and their combat effectiveness had not increased by a single bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson thought of the legendary \"Song of Orc Sacrifice\". Although this secret technique has a time limit, it's a pity that he is short of time now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you stay here for a long time, it will not be the expeditionary army attacking the bear court, but the orcs will destroy the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seemed that Hudson's eyes lit up instantly as soon as he saw the flying bear clan battle flag. It was hard to come out, and I had to bring some souvenirs back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bearman battle flag, which is full of exotic features and full of beauty, is undoubtedly a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although doing this is a bit of hatred, but things have developed to this point, and the hatred between the two sides has long been as deep as the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns don't love to fight, look for a chance to take away the orc's royal court battle flag, and **** off these bear-cubs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson communicated mentally, imitating the tone of the cub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the contract is magical enough to enable spiritual communication between humans and monsters. Otherwise, if you yelled like that and aroused the idea of ​​the strong orc, then you would have no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was only a snapping sound, the flagpole was suddenly broken from the middle, and Bear Stearn, pulling up the fluttering bearman battle flag, rushed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson ordered without hesitation: \"Retreat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest advantage of the cavalry is that they run fast. Even if the orcs behind want to chase, they can only look at the horse's **** to eat ashes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small number of strong orcs can catch up with the speed of cavalry. But facing an army alone is obviously not a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, neither humans nor orcs can compare to Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft with rough skin and thick flesh can run twice in the army, but intelligent races such as humans and orcs can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong one's own strength is, its defense power cannot compare with that of a monster of the same level, even a warrior who specializes in body training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop chasing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Full of anger, did not quench his reason. At this time, chasing him out, other than wasting effort, has no real meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future is long, and Xiong Renhuang has made up his mind deep in his heart. When their own army is assembled, they will definitely pull out the nail in Feixiong's Fort to dispel the hatred in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long after Hudson's army withdrew, the Bearman Legion that had come all the way finally appeared outside the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the imperial court camp full of corpses and the disappearing imperial court battle flag, Bruno looked ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the orcs in the camp were constantly active and pulled him out of despair. As long as the imperial court is preserved, there is room for maneuver in everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bite the bullet and walked into the camp, and appeared outside the tent of the Bear King, Bruno's footsteps suddenly slowed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was for the Savior this time, he was unable to participate in the battle to defend the imperial court. The army I brought out suffered heavy losses, but it actually happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regret is out of the question, if he does it all over again, he will still do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a matter of principle. No superior wants his subordinates to gamble with their own lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how correct the judgment is, ability is not worth mentioning in front of loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bite the bullet and step into the bear emperor's tent, a roar sounded in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Regardless of ordinary orcs, the most important thing is to kill thousands of elite bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When bragging in the future, the expeditionary army can also announce to the outside world openly: They are also the elite division that defeated the main force of the bears head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    20,000 infantry and 30,000 orcs head-to-head, including a bear army known as the first soldier on the mainland, this record is enough to take it home and brag about it for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Four thousand cavalry attacking the Xiongren imperial court is a classic battle worthy of a special book. Two shocking victories a day are enough to leave a name in the history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military victory is second, and the key is political influence. With this record, it is enough to offset the defeat of the previous expeditionary force in the Battle of Dacias.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this record is passed back to the country, it is estimated that Caesar III will secretly regret it and recall his son too early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the crown prince stays as the commander of the expeditionary force for a longer period of time if he loses it at night, he can also take advantage of this wave of military exploits and restore some of his reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is no medicine for regret in the world. Who would have thought that the expeditionary force, whose vitality was severely injured, would be able to come back from the predicament?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to think, he knows that the future of the Crown Prince Caesar, who is a negative teaching material, will be even more miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the outside world, the expeditionary force can still fight, and the failure of the Dacias battle was purely caused by the commander's blind command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom will insist on this view as a bargaining chip in the next political game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Crown Prince Caesar inherits the throne in the future, it will be difficult for him to have much say when it comes to military issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't care too much about things that would affect Chi Yu. Political and military victories will be sorted out later. The most urgent task is to count the losses and consider the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 4,000 cavalry at the time of the expedition, when they returned to the castle, there were only more than 3,200 cavalry left, and the loss rate was nearly 20%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also one of the reasons why Hudson decisively ordered the withdrawal of troops and did not continue to entangle in the Bear Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even on the way back, when he encountered tired bear infantry, he chose to let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is merciful, but the cavalry has lost too much. If he fights with the bear infantry again, the cavalry in his hand will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the absence of supplements, highly mobile cavalry forces are undoubtedly very valuable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had it not been for the expansion of so many cavalry before, Hudson would not have dared to plan this classic battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the cavalry is gone, relying purely on infantry for support, the expeditionary army will have a hard time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the cavalry, the situation of the infantry regiment is much better. In addition to the elite collisions in the early stage, which damaged many soldiers, the late stage was to beat the dogs in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of downsizing is about 10%, which is completely acceptable for Hudson compared to his brilliant record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that under the brilliant record, not many spoils were captured. The orcs came out to fight, and they didn't carry much supplies with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of good things in the bear court, but it's a pity that Hudson didn't dare to let the soldiers grab them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really carry a lot of spoils and lose the mobility of the cavalry, it is still unknown whether you can retreat completely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one who gained the most was the ambush team that was originally sent out to fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took up more than 300 carriages, and although a third of them pulled dead horse corpses, that was enough to make Hudson smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the trophies filled with more than two hundred carriages were gold coins or gold products, and the total value of this part alone was no less than two million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the trophies are all kinds, and there are even seven noble girls and five elf slaves among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a glance, it is clear that this is a gift for the big names in the bear court, and now everything is cheaper than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But he didn't move any of these beauties. We are all nobles, so we must rescue the family members of our colleagues when we meet them, so as to appease them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in front of countless nobles, no one dared to throw stones at you. Master Hudson, who loves feathers, will not make mistakes in this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five elf slaves, let alone. All of them are actually men, Master Hudson doesn't have such a heavy taste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had a special interest in the Moxi nobles, and he was also speechless for a while. It's really full to support and play with flowers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I asked a group of nobles in the army, maybe I was embarrassed in front of everyone, but no one wanted to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with it, Hudson didn't think about it. We can only lock him up first, and wait for the nobleman with special hobbies to come and claim it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the probability of this happening is not high. Special hobbies are nothing new in the aristocratic circle, but few dare to make things public.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many trophies, Hudson must not be alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles who participated in the battle will get one share, and the nobles who died in battle will have an extra share reserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In these face projects, Hudson has never been stingy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The headquarters of the expeditionary force also had to leave an activity fund. Although there is no money to spend now, who can tell what will happen in the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War can only stop ordinary people. For those warmongers who are eager to make war money, troubled times are the best opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mercenaries from all over the world have been frantically pouring into the Principality of Moxi recently. If it weren't for the siege of Da Pest city, it is estimated that there will be an endless stream of people reporting every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Crisis\" means \"opportunity\" only when there is \"danger\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this opportunity, commoners and nobles will always be two different classes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX's supreme mobilization order cleared the legal barriers for commoners to become nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, if you take a risk in the war and achieve outstanding achievements, you can achieve a leap in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether you can cross it, it still depends on luck. Many aristocratic ancestors made their fortunes in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prosperity, decline, revival, decline...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it does not perish, this is a cycle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no family that lasts forever in this world. Even the ancient aristocrats who claim to have been passed down for thousands or tens of thousands of years may have only one surname left by their ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gold coins and gold products are easy to handle, the value is clear at a glance, and can be divided directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the pile of messy things can only be dealt with after getting rid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is a time of war, and the previous price system has already collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of handicrafts that were originally highly sought after are now less valuable than bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prices of all commodities linked to war have soared to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wanted elf slaves, but the magic equipment among the spoils was looted by a group of nobles as soon as it appeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final processing method is very simple, directly take it out for auction—the one with the highest price wins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything that can be digested internally has been digested, and the remaining magic materials that are less used, and a bunch of strange and unrecognizable things are left in the warehouse of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, Hudson naturally took the biggest piece of cake, followed by Lord Bear Stearns who was in charge of combat power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle flag of the Royal Bear Court is not simply measurable by money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the battle flag cannot be sent out now, or Hudson is unwilling to hand it over cheaply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Moxi Principality is too busy to take care of itself, so it simply cannot afford such a big price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handing it over to them has no real meaning except to boost morale. No matter how generous the promise was, Hudson would not foolishly go to the Principality of Moxi to guard the frontier for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bring it back to China, with such a long journey, who knows what will happen?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orc snatched it back halfway, it would be a waste of work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, Hudson can't return to the country at the moment, and the Koslow family has no one in the court. Even if they bring things back, it is difficult to get what they deserve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of making a wedding dress for someone else, it is better to keep it in your hand to decorate the appearance. If you hang it in the living room, no matter who sees it, you have to respect it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When training troops, you can also show off from time to time to eliminate the fear of orcs in ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this battle, Hudson clearly felt the transformation of the army. Not only did the troops participating in the war become more confident, but even the morale of the defenders in the city also rose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thing that made me pee my pants when I heard the orc will never happen again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to a group of colleagues constantly bragging, the local nobles of Moxi who stayed behind were envious and jealous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a battle of this level, as long as the number of participants is gathered, it can also be used to brag for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, before the fight started, few people dared to sign up to participate. Of course, even if they are willing to sign up, Hudson will not give them a chance to cause trouble on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want your name to appear on the list of military exploits, it is not completely impossible. As long as you give a generous gift to Master Hudson, you can be hung up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The size of military exploits is completely judged by the value of the gift. Anyway, the Expeditionary Army and the Moxi Defenders are two systems, and they will not rob each other's resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sorting out the internal issues, a good report of artistic processing was distributed to the Quartet in the name of the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson couldn't help complaining: The domestic expeditionary force is not valued, and even the direct contact with the capital is difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time a message is sent, either let the Griffon cavalry of the Mosi people deliver the message, or send the messenger to gallop thousands of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Difficulties in communication are not all problems. The biggest advantage is that Hudson's authority is high enough, and he doesn't need to ask for instructions on everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is to provoke a big battle, there is no need to report to the kingdom. If you lose the battle, you can even directly block the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the expeditionary force is well controlled and the soldiers damaged in the battle are replenished in time, they can be fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a country that has been fighting fiercely with orcs for a long time, being chased by orcs is not a big deal at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the position is not lost and the troops are not lost too much, then everything is considered a strategic transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, Earl Hudson ran to attack the royal court of the bear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the battle report was sent out, the news had already spread out. I have communicated with the neighbors in advance, and everyone is paying close attention to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the specific situation, but just looking at the orcs being chased around, everyone knows that Hudson won the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a good thing, naturally, it is necessary to inform the boss. Originally, Marshal Hodge only regarded it as a small victory and didn't take it to heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the news that came back one after another made him more and more frightened. As someone who has seen big scenes, Marshal Hodge was still able to barely hold on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the news of the attack on the Xiongren imperial court came out, the old marshal was also broken. No longer caring about his image, he directly asked out the doubts in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Excellency the Marshal. We just received news from the people below, and we couldn't believe it. We even sent people to the bear camp to investigate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the situation at the scene, they had indeed just experienced a big battle, and the camp was severely damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the defenders in various places, the troops of the other four imperial courts were also suddenly mobilized, and all of them went to the position of the Xiongren imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be preliminarily determined that the Xiongren Imperial Court was forced to seek help from the other four imperial courts because of serious threats from foreign enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only nearby force that can pose a threat to the bear court is the Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force stationed in the Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the day when the incident happened, the expeditionary force also mobilized a large number of troops, and the defenders of several nearby castles also dispatched troops to support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the original agreed plan was for everyone to pretend to attack the bear royal court, forcing the orc army to come back for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know what happened in the middle, and finally the feint turned into a strong attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the Earl of Hudson discovered the fighter, or maybe there was a reason for the attack. The Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force did launch an attack on the bear court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the collected information, the expeditionary force should have taken advantage of it this time. For the specific situation, we still have to wait for the Earl of Hudson's battle report. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halley replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was rubbed on the ground by the orcs, and they had to be extremely careful when they went out of the city and made small moves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that someone dared to stab the bear royal court and took advantage of it, the news is really unbelievable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the idea is not important, the key is the facts in front of you. The expeditionary force really did it, and it did it beautifully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Marshal Hodge's face suddenly turned rosy, and he said with a smile:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is a great joy, Earl Hudson's move, the pressure on Da Paesi will definitely be greatly relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Royal Bear Court is really hit hard, the pressure on our nearby castles will also drop sharply in the short term, and the scope of activities can be expanded again. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is happy from the bottom of his heart. Seeing that the situation is becoming more and more unfavorable to the Principality of Moxi, he, the marshal, is also under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The voice of criticism within the principality has never stopped. No one was kicked out, just because no more suitable candidate could be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Personal fame and fortune are nothing more than that, the key is the overthrow of the Principality, which worries him the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no eggs under the nest. Once the Principality of Moxi collapses, all the nobles and nobles attached to the Principality will fall into the quagmire with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Report!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, Flying Bear Castle has sent an urgent battle report, please...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the visitor could finish speaking, Marshal Hodge snatched the battle report, opened the seal and looked through it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not much content on the parchment, but it weighs a thousand pounds in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you looked down, the more obvious the change in Marshal Hodge's expression became, and in the end his mouth directly turned into a big O shape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Halley, immediately send someone to forward the battle report to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to prevent accidents, let me make a few more copies and send them out by different routes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearman Emperor's Court, facing the reinforcements from the Four Great Emperor's Courts, Bearman Emperor was embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old nest is not guaranteed, so I have to ask my allies for help. If it is spread, it will be laughed at for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the half-smile expressions of all the visitors, you can tell that everyone is laughing at him now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that people are watching a joke, but he recruited these reinforcements himself. Being able to come over is a favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing face, that's the Bear Emperor's own business, not the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty Xiong Huang, is this Earl of Hudson really so powerful?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Alex asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Beamon family also fought against Hudson, it is a pity that the unlucky cavalry regiment was wiped out directly, and no valuable information was sent back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of strategic needs, the Bimon Royal Court has never had time to retaliate, but the account is still written down first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Bimon and Ursine tribes have always disliked each other, they still recognize the strength of the Ursine infantry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that this old enemy has suffered a great loss in the hands of Hudson, Crown Prince Alex, who wants to revenge, must naturally pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"He is the most powerful existence among the enemies we have encountered since the beginning of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is he powerful in using troops, but also has a strong ability to govern the army. Especially the First Legion of his direct descendant Expeditionary Army, which is the top legion among the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter them on the battlefield in the future, everyone must be careful. This time we were careless for a while, and we fell into his way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong Renhuang answered boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to flatter, if it can't prove that Hudson is great, it will appear that he is too incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to make yourself a waste, you can only make the enemy more powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a little unnatural at first, but Xiong Renhuang soon got used to it. Apart from himself, two of the other four people present nodded in agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, Emperor Xiong understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Yinyue Wolf Clan and the Beamon Clan were defeated by Hudson successively. Although the Xiongren royal family suffered the heaviest losses, the other two suffered considerable losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is huddled in the Fort of Flying Bear, and they are still sitting on tens of thousands of heavy troops. There is no way to take revenge for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But keep Hudson active outside, and everyone's face will be difficult. Xiong Renhuang wanted to brag about Hudson's power, and they just went along with the flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the enemies are so powerful, the small defeats encountered before seem logical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what, everyone is out to mess around, so you still need to have face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three of the five royal families all said they were powerful, but it was hard for the remaining two families to believe it or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the approval and endorsement of the Orc Empire, a general star was raised in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As a civil official, asking him to preside over the military and political conference is to catch ducks on the shelves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this terrible time, it is normal to not understand the strategic purpose of the orc army's actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you understand it, then something big will happen. A strategic plan that even amateur players can see through is an obvious conspiracy, and there is no way to solve it if you know it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the news from the nobles along the way, the orc army marched all the way to the southwest, without touching any of the noble castles along the way, and the soldiers pointed directly at the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of a small principality, risking the risk of being cut off, how can people not understand? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg was unable to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't figure out the motives of the orcs, but the current situation is obviously not the worst. When the flames of war raged to the Principality of Orton, the material supply channel of the Principality of Moxi was reduced by one, but the pressure of the war would also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How big the impact will be in the future cannot be determined for the time being. In a short period of time, it was a respite for the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles everywhere are desperately expanding their armies and preparing for war. The longer the delay, the more fully prepared everyone will be. If it is attacked by an army of orcs, it can last for a few more days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Could it be that the orcs played around and outflanked, cut off our connection with our neighbors, and then flanked us back and forth?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar strategy, it seems that in a great war one hundred and fifty years ago, the orcs used it against the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caught off guard, the Alpha Kingdom suffered heavy losses. Canglan City, the capital of the king, was in the middle of a war and fell into the hands of the orcs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Renato couldn't help guessing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, because of his work, he is very familiar with the history of various countries. Seeing the actions of the orc army, he couldn't help but want to take over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's unlikely. Our current situation is different from that of the Alpha Kingdom at that time. The city of Dapace has now been exposed to the front of the orcs, and there is no need to outflank it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the orcs want to drive straight in, set off endless slaughter in the northern land, and lure other alien races to join this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or maybe the Principality of Orton has something they are bound to get. For this treasure, they can adjust their battle plan at all costs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military Minister Martins analyzed carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to pull people into the water, deliberately toss a little movement out, to prove to the outside world that the human race is about to die, that is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also countless things to start a war for a treasure, let alone just adjust the battle plan now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both results are possible, but it is more confusing. What the truth is, it can only be known after the orcs do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is that the unlucky Principality of Orton is relatively weak this time. Even if it is not notified in time, at most it will be blamed a little bit, and it has no ability to do anything to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't guess, then don't bother to guess. Although I feel sorry for my allies, there is no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good news!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after the meeting was over, the head of the He Gryphon Cavalry came over with an urgent battle report from the front line, and pulled everyone back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the high-level principality, this kind of thing has happened countless times since the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting off work on time is simply a luxury. It is common to pull people up in the middle of the night to deal with urgent matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prosperity and wealth are tied to the fate of the principality, and there is no way for everyone to retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said in a gaffe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a good thing to see the good news, but the good news in front of you is too exaggerated. He also knows that the front line has the habit of exaggerating achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But generally speaking, everyone has a certain degree of control. Usually, it is a slight increase in combat achievements, but no matter how you look at the battle report now, it seems to be \"multiplied by ten\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, Hodge has verified the content of the battle report. There may be embellishments in this battle report, but overall there is not much difference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the photostone records provided by the expeditionary force, our people have also conducted reconnaissance on the battlefield. Even the battle flag of the bear royal court fell into the hands of Earl Hudson. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Campals explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too shocking news, everyone can't help but doubt it. Even if it is an urgent news, it is inevitable to verify the authenticity first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief gaffe, Prime Minister Herceg quickly recovered. He has encountered too many things these days, and his mental endurance has also improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not in line with common sense, and it is not worth the evidence of solid hammer. Anything else can be faked, and the battle flag of the Xiongren Royal Court can never be faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be able to carry away their battle flag from the bear royal court, there must be a big victory. It seems reasonable to injure an elite bear army and disable two or three cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides being happy, it is also inevitable to be sad. Now that the war has progressed, the Principality of Moxi has not seen a few capable fighters, and the most capable ones are actually the reinforcements from the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge is stable, but his aggressiveness is really insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it, everyone still has no idea of ​​changing coaches. Being aggressive is a good thing, but it also depends on when.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation of the Principality of Moxi, if it is really replaced by an enterprising coach, I don't know if it can turn defeat into victory, but the probability of losing everyone's wealth is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To defeat the strong with the weak, just brag about it in normal times. If it is taken seriously, it would be a human tragedy if the front-line generals had to complete it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's report the battle report to the Alpha Kingdom. The expeditionary force's victory this time is of great significance. We must communicate with them in depth about the follow-up matters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said with some embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeat not long ago caused a crack in the relationship between the two countries. It was only under the pressure of the orcs that the two sides tacitly chose to ignore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the sudden change, the expeditionary force has shown strength far beyond their expectations, and the importance of the Alpha Kingdom to them has once again increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This reversal will directly affect the diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Prime Minister Herceg has cursed more than once: Crown Prince Caesar is incompetent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the expeditionary force had shown this kind of combat effectiveness earlier, the outcome of the last major battle would have been reversed, and the situation in the Principality of Moxi would not have collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, the problem of communication with the Alpha Kingdom is easy to solve. Although we did not send troops to participate in this war, everyone is fully cooperating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this good news, all the previous unhappiness can be uncovered. Even if there are twists and turns, it is something that needs to be entangled within the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's us to think about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force has won a big victory, the situation on the front line has changed, and the main force of the orc army has gone to the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dropping troops from the front line, the opportunity to relieve the siege of Dapace has appeared. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs Renato's voice fell, and the eyes of everyone in the room lit up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now I focused my attention on the battle report, but now that I was reminded like this, everyone immediately realized that the turning point of the war had come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being surrounded by an army of orcs all the time, it is impossible not to panic. Being able to drive away the orc army outside is a great thing for everyone present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the expectant gazes from his colleagues, Minister of Military Affairs Martins instantly felt the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relieve the siege of Dapace, he also wants to! But the problem is that it can be done. If one trick is not planned carefully, it may be another big defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After an in-depth analysis of the reasons for the failure of the Dacias Battle, Martins, who has learned his lesson, has lost confidence in engaging in a big battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with the number of troops, it is purely that the newly formed army cannot be used. Defending the city can only make do with it, and a decisive battle in the wild is a burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too difficult to defeat the orc army with only a few main force armies in the Principality. What's more, if you want to dispatch troops, you have to have the orcs willing to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the pressure from his colleagues was too great for him to say no. For a moment, Martins seemed to think of something, and suddenly said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"To solve the siege of Dapes, our own strength is still not enough. Although the main force of the orcs has left, it doesn't mean they won't come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can't make a quick decision and end the battle before the enemy's main force returns to help, our people will be in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the principality's main armies are almost all suppressed by the orcs, and it is best to mobilize the Alpha Kingdom's expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to complete this plan, we'd better communicate with Earl Hudson first and ask for his opinion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't bear the pressure yourself, you can only transfer the conflict. The generals in the country are all under the influence of these powerful people, and it is difficult to bear the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force is different. As foreign reinforcements, they have independent command power and are nominally under the command of the Principality of Moxi. In fact, their binding force on the expeditionary force is very low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military order issued by the Principality of Moxi, to Hudson, is a document that can be thrown into the trash can at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consulting the other party's opinion is a real negotiation. If the two sides fail to reach an agreement, it is normal operation to put on strikes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, everyone looked at each other, but no one said much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, there is an army of 300,000 orcs outside the city of Dapace. Even if there is only one Beamon cavalry regiment that is not satisfied with the formation, no one dares to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without an elite division to entangle the Beamon cavalry, it is almost impossible to break the siege of Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family knows their own affairs. The Principality's standing army suffered heavy losses in the offensive and defensive battle of Fort Augustus. Now the most powerful troops are the private armies of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight head-on with your own private army and Beamon cavalry, no one has a clue. This kind of high-risk drudgery, it is best to find a wronged head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire battlefield, the most suitable ones now are the expeditionary forces of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no free lunch in the world, and there are not enough benefits. It is obviously impossible to ask people to work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the fact that the expeditionary force took the initiative to attack, it seems that they have a firm stance on the issue of combating the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In essence, political factors were also involved behind it. Hudson took over the position of commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, and also took over the mess left by Crown Prince Caesar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the previous responsibility, he does not need to bear it, but he must be responsible for dealing with the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make up for the previous big defeat, the best way is to cover it up with victory. As long as he wins on the battlefield, the historical problems left over from the previous defeat can be covered up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political factors + military training needs + fighter jets delivered to your door, these three common factors contributed to this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mess has been cleaned up, and the name of the expeditionary force has also been branded out. If you want people and the main force of the orcs to work hard, then you need to negotiate terms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Orton, King Orton XIX woke up from his sleep and was forced to start a day's work before he could stretch himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps most monarchs live like this, but for a salted fish monarch, this kind of life is really too embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, since the failure of the Battle of Dacias, the Principality of Orton has also been pushed to the edge of the cliff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi was crumbling, and their nearest neighbor had to prepare for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just received a good news from the Principality of Moxi. Seeing that the allies won the battle, King Orton XIX is still in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when he saw the document under the good news, his face quickly turned green with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expeditionary force of the Alpha Kingdom turned the tables against the wind, but the orc army was about to kill his doorstep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notification is only made at this time, isn't this deliberately cheating allies!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the explanation given by the Principality of Moxie, King Orton XIX did not believe it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of nearly 100,000 orcs is mostly the main army of the orc empire. The Moxi Principality, which is a local snake, actually said that it has not found this level of troop mobilization?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to complain, the enemy is about to kill. Even scolding the Moxi people to death would not solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, how are we preparing, can we resist the invasion of the orc army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the king's question, Prime Minister Jacob also looked helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many big countries that are not opponents of the orcs. Isn't it a deliberate embarrassment for them to be the top of a small principality?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the orc army killed them this time, so they couldn't help but say no.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have mobilized 200,000 troops, of which 150,000 are deployed at the junction with the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another 50,000 troops are being mobilized, and it is expected to be completed next month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that we have always been on good terms with the Mosi people, and have not built defensive fortifications in the border area. Now I am busy with temporary rush work, so...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the faltering words of Prime Minister Jacob, Orton XIX read despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army was only mobilized, and there was no time to complete the training; the defense line was not completed, and the enemy was about to kill the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the double blow, what can the Principality of Orton do to resist the orc's soldiers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The discussion in the palace is still going on, and the shouts of killing on the border have already sounded. Perhaps they are too confident in their allies, and the defenders have not considered the issue of being attacked by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the enemy is found, the battle has already begun. Countless Orton soldiers who were busy building fortifications saw the orc's butcher knife as soon as they raised their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hold on!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Idiot, quickly pick up your weapon and fight the enemy!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No refund!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers, who were belatedly aware, shouted with all their might.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the serf who just put down his **** has never encountered such a scene. Many people were dumbfounded when they saw the scene of blood and flesh flying everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some timid ones were so scared that they peed on their pants, and they didn't even know how to take up arms to resist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, according to the experience of facing the nobles in the past, the foolish kneeling to the orc begged for mercy, and the result was naturally no accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who led the battle. The first deserter appeared, followed by the second, third... until the Nth deserter appeared, the battlefield was completely in chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unwilling to be defeated, the noble officer joined the battle with his direct guards, briefly delaying the advance of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are still too few such warriors, and the leading role only affects some soldiers, and more serf soldiers chose to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the big rout comes, the power of the individual is small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

War and fire swept towards the Principality of Orton, and the ancient principality wept under the butcher's knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Quick, send someone to send the information back! Immediately...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Bernard said tremblingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the guards on the front line, he really didn't know how to explain to the king about the scene in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Negligence and overconfidence in allies are just one of the reasons. In essence, the Principality of Orton is still weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, there are 150,000 troops on the front line. In fact, it is more appropriate to describe it as \"140,000 civilians + 10,000 defenders\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main task of the recruited civilians is not to receive military training, but to build fortifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are stupid, on the contrary, it's a sign of intelligence. Letting the serfs who have just put down their hoes defend the city is still reluctant, and it is unreliable to take up weapons and fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, it was still insufficient preparation in advance, and they didn't realize that the orc army would kill them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not until the defense line of Fort Augustus fell and the Principality of Moxi asked for help that the senior officials of the Principality of Orton realized the danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arguing and arguing, the resolution to build a defense line was barely passed. When it came time for specific implementation, the aristocratic bureaucrats proved what bureaucracy is with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Orton didn't really start to take action until the Battle of Dacias failed, the orc army came to Dapac, and the Principality of Moxi was crumbling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was the first time to carry out nationwide mobilization. If there were no accidents, accidents would definitely happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of time constraints, the nobles of the Principality of Orton did not have time to adapt to the new mode of warfare, and still applied the original thinking of fighting with the human country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the internal power struggle, the frontline command of the Principality of Orton was divided into three, each divided into defense zones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the troops on the front line are all elite, there is nothing wrong with this division, at most it is a little troublesome when coordinating the command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the army of the Principality of Orton is not elite at all. Except for a small number of noble guards, the rest are all come here to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no perfect line of defense. After reaching the front line, the army wants to defend the city, but is surprised to find that there is no castle fortress that can accommodate tens of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the aristocratic castles can accommodate very limited troops, and they can be stationed with 8,000 troops, so they are considered big castles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is even more pitiful is that this kind of castle, when designing, most of them did not consider the problem of water source for long-term garrison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, during the civil war among the nobles of the human race, everyone was playing by the rules, and rarely did things well. Unless it is a life and death enmity, it will not be under siege for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nobles need fame, but orcs don't. If the enemy is changed, these shortcomings must be resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no choice but to use recruits as civilian husbands. If these hidden dangers that can be seen at a glance are not eliminated, the castle will be a large coffin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Bernard's thoughts were doomed to be in vain, the Griffon Cavalry was intercepted by the eagle master as soon as it took off. If you can't get away from flying in the sky, you can only run back from the ground to report the letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can run in all directions, and the orcs will definitely not be able to stop them. When the news will reach the capital, it depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are extremely fast on the battlefield, and even a momentary delay can cause serious consequences, let alone such an uncertain time delay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disaster is destined to belong to the Principality of Orton. First, the army on the front line collapses, and then the poor suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc soldiers who came all the way couldn't stop since they raised their butcher knives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purgatory on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, the news of the great victory of the expeditionary force came, and the atmosphere in the palace became uncomfortable, even more tense than when the battle of Dacias failed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great Caesar III always had a smile on his face when he was in front of people; but when he was alone, he couldn't help but sigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar's performance was even worse. Wherever that icy face went, the temperature would drop by ten degrees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two hostesses are not in a good mood, let alone the mood of the hostess. However, a good royal education also requires the queen to maintain her image at all times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Annoyance, regret, complaints, all kinds of emotions are just a few. The resentful look in his eyes made Caesar III hide away when he saw the queen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's been a long time since I've been back, and I haven't recovered yet. Could it be that all the years of martial arts lessons have been wasted?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III couldn't help reprimanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to become a qualified king, you can't do it without going through wind and rain. From the very beginning, arranging for his son to go to the Principality of Moxi was to let him accept the baptism of wind and rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally wanted to let Little Caesar lead the expeditionary army to follow the steps of the Principality of Moxi, and slowly suffer defeats together, so as to sharpen his mind and learn how to face setbacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan did not change quickly, and the start was almost Tianhu, but in the end it ended with Huazhu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more tragic is that as soon as the expeditionary army's mess was thrown to others, a shocking reversal took place immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last fig leaf is gone. Facts have proved that it wasn't that the expeditionary force was incapable of fighting. The defeat was purely because his commander was too useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With one blow after another, Crown Prince Caesar has reached the brink of collapse. The original self-confidence and arrogance have all disappeared without a trace, replaced by deep self-doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing his father's scolding, Crown Prince Caesar's face changed slightly, as if he wanted to say something, but for some reason, he finally swallowed the words that came to his lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mess was too big, and he didn't feel anything when he was in the Principality of Moxi, but he felt the pressure immediately after returning to China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family members of the noble officers of the Expeditionary Army directly organized a group to make a fuss in the capital, demanding an explanation from the royal family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Caesar III responded properly, and the situation was complicated, and the identities of the dead had not yet been determined, so everyone was appeased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family members have calmed down, but it doesn't mean the matter is over. The far-reaching impact brought about by this will accompany Little Caesar's life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is making a fuss about it now, because he is just the crown prince. Once upgraded to a king in the future, this is a ready-made bargaining chip in the hands of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Caesar III became more and more angry. It's just that reason made him restrain his temper, and forcibly suppressed the thought of beating someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, little Caesar. You are no longer a child, and you have to learn to face some things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no shame in admitting that you are flawed in some way. No one is perfect in this world, everyone has their own shortcomings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that some people let these defects be exposed; some people have been covering them up very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you cover it up, what exists will always exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with ordinary nobles, we have more advantages. A qualified monarch does not need to do everything himself, and the matter of charging forward can be left to others to complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be distracted by those traditions on the mainland. The way of life of the Alpha Kingdom is different from theirs. With the great enemy of the orcs, everything must be based on survival, and we cannot tolerate our willfulness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are not the only crown prince who is not suitable for the battlefield. Among the previous kings of my Alpha Kingdom, more than half of them voluntarily gave up the right to personally command the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all true words. Although the royal family has retained a large number of military-related inheritance, there are really not many kings who have the talent to lead soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Caesar III himself, the ability to command the army is also rubbish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that he didn't fall as badly as his own son when trying to command an army to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small defeat that is not worth mentioning, the casualties are not large and there is no trouble, just arrange a blame man to go on top.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After learning his lesson, Caesar III put all his energy on politics. Relying on superb political means, he also secured the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighed secretly, Caesar III regained a smile on his face, as if immersed in the joy of victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what you think in your heart, you always have to face what you should face. The subordinates won the battle, and as a qualified monarch, one must show joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially at this juncture, if you don't do a good job of saving face, it is easy to be interpreted by the people below as: envious of the virtuous and capable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a monarch, once he is labeled as \"jealous of the virtuous and capable\", it will be difficult to win the support of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The expeditionary force achieved two great victories in the Principality of Moxi in one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ambush one orc transportation team, disabled four orc legions, including a bear army main force, captured 30,000 enemy heads, and won a bear royal court battle flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The results of the battle are so rich that it can be called the most since the war began. For the expeditionary force to achieve such a record, Viscount Hudson should take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is still going on, and we can't do the specific calculation of military achievements for the time being. Everything will be done after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister, arrange for people to spread this battle report to the whole country as soon as possible to boost the morale of the people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If anyone has read the battle report, they will know that the record in the king's mouth has changed a little bit compared to what the expeditionary army sent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original \"heavy injury\" became \"disabled\" in the mouth of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, in such a formal occasion, it is absolutely impossible for such an outrageous slip of the tongue to occur.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is for political propaganda. If it is not for worrying that the bragging is too big, no one will believe it. He doesn't mind changing the word \"total annihilation\" at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although such a big publicity is very detrimental to his son, as a monarch, he is destined not to act emotionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have already started the propaganda work. It will spread to every corner of the kingdom within five days at the latest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the good news, there is also a news from the Moxi people. Five days ago, the orc army divided up and marched towards the Principality of Orton. Perhaps the battle has already begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi people sent a special envoy here, nominally to discuss the issue of rewards for the great victory, but in fact they wanted to gain more support from us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, they are planning a campaign to lift the siege of Dapes, but they are suffering from insufficient strength in their hands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, caused all the ministers present to turn their attention to the map on the wall. After staring at the position of the Principality of Orton for a while, they finally came to a unified conclusion: this military operation of the orcs had nothing to do with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although all countries are allies now, it is better for allies to be unlucky than to be unlucky themselves. As long as the soldiers of the orc army do not point at him, then everything is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the orc army will continue to sweep the country southward after taking the Principality of Orton, or turn around and attack the Warhammer Kingdom next door, everyone can't care so much anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, they are all forced out. Not long after the war broke out, the northern countries reached an agreement to jointly fight against the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the final result is that the Alpha Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi are fighting hard, and the other countries have been just shouting slogans and have not really contributed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever puts it on, the heart will be unbalanced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, saying this is a bit wronged to the Principality of Orton and the Earl of Ruilin, and they also contributed their efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is thousands of miles to give away the head, and there is no record. This hard-to-measure contribution is easily overlooked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at everyone's reactions, Caesar III restrained his smile, and asked hesitantly: \"Do you think it is necessary for us to continue to increase investment in the Moxi battlefield under the current situation?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that deep down he is conflicted. On the one hand, he hoped that the Principality of Moxi would last longer and buy more time for the kingdom; on the other hand, he was worried that too much power would be consumed on the battlefield of Moxi, which would affect the kingdom's future plans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Moxi Principality is miserable now, in fact, the fighting intensity in the northern battlefield of the Alpha Kingdom is not much lower than theirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five mighty dukes of the Northland, who were originally invincible, have lost their temper due to the orcs, and the fiefdoms in their hands have fallen to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nearby orc tribes have even moved over and occupied the territory that originally belonged to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the northern nobles suffered heavy losses, but all the provinces that participated in the war did not complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the current international situation has changed. The Terran Alliance has decided to clear the field. It is very difficult for the orcs to retreat this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from the diplomatic point of view, now giving some help to the Principality of Moxi will help improve the international image of the kingdom and will be very helpful in rebuilding the political structure of the northern region after the war. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As foreign minister, he had to think further. Everyone's eyes are still on the war, but Earl Francis has considered the post-war international situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the northern region of the human race, the Alpha Kingdom has always been the strongest existence. However, this strongest kingdom has almost no sense of presence in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't know how to play international politics. The main reason is that the orc empire is behind them, and all the energy of the kingdom is forced to focus on resisting the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't take care of yourself, the affairs of the countries in the northern region can naturally be mixed less, so try to mix as little as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation in the Principality of Moxi has been corrupted, and it is almost impossible to recover. Even if the expeditionary force achieves a big victory, it will not change anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the orcs make up their minds, it is only a matter of time before Dapace falls. Even if the kingdom sent troops again, it would not be able to quench the near thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the plan they planned to break the siege, from a military point of view, the feasibility is not high. Orcs are not fools, maybe the current Dapes is a huge bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose is to lure the Mosi army out of the castle fortress, so as to seek an opportunity to annihilate them in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's military strength is very valuable, there is no need to waste too much time on the Mosi people. If conditions permit, it is best to find an opportunity to withdraw the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of the post-war political situation, I think it is more appropriate to wait until the Orc Empire is defeated before considering this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the international situation changes in the future, the core factor that determines all this is strength. As long as the kingdom is strong enough, no one will dare to ignore our existence. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, decisively voted against it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Support and opposition appeared at the same time, and soon the ministers were divided into two factions, quarreling with each other non-stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the end of the meeting, no result was discussed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But some things, if there is no result, it is also a result. Caesar III's delay in making a statement is itself a political statement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The word \"drag\", isn't it a kind of peaceful and elegant rejection?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stems from interests. If the orc army does not go towards the Principality of Orton, but chooses a country that borders both the Kingdom of Alpha and the Principality of Moxi, that will be another situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the meeting ended, Caesar III, who was in a bad mood, frowned and ordered to the palace minister: \"Write a document and canonize Viscount Hudson as earl.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Winning people's hearts will always be a compulsory course for kings. Even if there is some anger deep in his heart, Caesar III will never show it on the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, judging from the current situation, as long as the expeditionary force does not have major problems, it is a high probability event that Hudson will become a real earl after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others may not be clear, but Caesar III sees it very clearly. Several great nobles in the kingdom have fallen behind, and it is only a matter of time before they are replaced by the latter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The renewal of the great nobles is not a bad thing for the kingdom. As long as the great nobles don't annex each other and become bigger, there is no need for the king to come out and be a villain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The procedure for the canonization of nobles at the earl level is very complicated. Not only must they have enough military exploits, but they must also be approved by the king and the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a replacement of old and new nobles, there will be more problems involved. Until the end of the war, there is no time to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, court earls that cannot be passed on from generation to generation are not so valuable. As long as the king agrees, the canonization can be carried out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the good name, the actual weight depends entirely on the position in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that are beneficial but not costly are used to buy people's hearts. Caesar III was never stingy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory, Baron Redman has not been calm since he received the news from the capital. To be exact, the entire Koslow family boiled up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally everyone was worried about going to the Moxi Principality this time, but in the face of successive victories, everything changed. Everyone's confidence in Hudson suddenly swelled to the point where it was difficult to increase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"crisis\" does exist, but the \"danger\" belongs to others, while the \"opportunity\" belongs to the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, Baron Redman couldn't help but imagine the grand occasion when the Koslow family entered the ranks of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warmly received every visitor, even though he knew that these people came for a purpose, Baron Redman still never tired of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multiple friends and multiple paths, even if most of them are not worth making friends, as long as one of them can play a role, then it is not a loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't expect everyone to help, as long as there are no bad things at critical moments, that's enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arbor County, Viscount Oran received the news with mixed feelings. It should be a good thing to make a decisive move and find a potential son-in-law.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that this son-in-law's ability is too outstanding, and the original ally relationship may become a competitor in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family, which has accumulated strength for many years, is planning to take the opportunity to return to the ranks of the great nobles. With Hudson's outbreak, the Koslow family with insufficient background also showed the strength to attack the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of one radish and one pit, if you are not careful, the two families will turn from relatives to competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for completing the leap at the same time and crossing the ranks of the great nobles together, this possibility is extremely slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at his daughter lovingly, Viscount Oran could only comfort himself that the two families would not run into each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, is there anything wrong with this battle report?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa, who sensed something was wrong, asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She clearly remembered that when she received the good news about Hudson in the previous two times, her father showed off it many times and picked his son-in-law's eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Nothing, it's just that Hudson's performance is too strong. I was a little surprised for a while, it's hard to accept!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran forced himself to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of perfunctory was immediately seen through by Melissa. After living together for so many years, she still knows Viscount Oran very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you were really surprised, you wouldn't frown so tightly. Vaguely, she seemed to think of something, and asked uncertainly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"But the rise of Hudson has conflicted with the interests of the family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that our two families are separated by several counties. Even if there is a conflict, it will not be a core interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    unless…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, Melissa's expression darkened. When it comes to the core strategy between the two big families, it cannot be resolved in a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the two families are facing each other because of their interests in the future, she will be in a bit of an embarrassing situation. However, this kind of thing is common in the circle of nobles, and they can only admit that they are unlucky when they encounter it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Melissa. It's not as bad as you think, it's just the worst case, and it doesn't have to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how the situation develops, your marriage will not be affected. The background of the Koslow family is too shallow, and Hudson is a smart person, and he will never let his reputation be seriously stained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, everything is possible in war. The Liufeng family has already been eliminated, and more families will be eliminated in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are enough great nobles in decline, there will be enough opportunities to appear, and our two families will not be able to face each other. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Viscount Oran's explanation, Melissa said hesitantly: \"Father, maybe we should write to remind Hudson about this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, he won successive victories one after another. He should have a high status in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are far away in the Principality of Moxi at this moment, there is a high probability that they will join forces when there is a major counterattack in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you operate deliberately, create a few more accidents...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the words came to her lips, Melissa took them back. This kind of cheating of teammates is obviously not in line with the noble spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at his daughter, Viscount Oran said with a little relief: \"Melissa, you have finally grown up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of nobles is cruel, silly Baitian is destined not to survive three episodes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if an established orc army passed by, they had to make a detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within a radius of twenty miles, there were almost no shadows of orcs. As if a tacit agreement had been reached, the orcs would not cross the border and break in, and the defenders would not go out to cause trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expected orc revenge did not come as expected. After the high-level meeting of the five imperial courts, each of them chose to go back to their respective families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously everyone is sensible, and they know very well that face is not worth mentioning in front of racial strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did not waste the hard-won tranquility period. Hurry up and strengthen the training of the army in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time he offended the Xiongren Royal Court so hard, if there is a chance next time, they will definitely come to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if the war doesn't break out, but once it starts, there will be rivers of blood. If one's own strength is not enough, it is doomed to tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, orcs invaded the Principality of Orton?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Your Excellency the Earl. You heard me right, the main force of the orc army did bypass Dapace and head straight for the Principality of Orton.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting the exact answer from Marshal Hodge, Hudson didn't care about his image, so he got up and opened the map, and studied it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon he came to the conclusion that the Warhammer Kingdom was going to be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the situation in the Principality of Moxi has deteriorated, the Kingdom of Warhammer has added a new line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does not know the specific situation. Anyway, the defense line has not been fully completed yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the orc army is heading south, it is obvious that they want to bypass this line of defense and launch an attack from the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obviously too late to continue repairing the defense line. No matter how fast the construction period is, they can't hold back and they can keep detours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the Moxi Principality, which has a flat surface, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Warhammer Kingdom is mountains and hills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The special terrain is not suitable for the march of the army, but it cannot support the special race among the orcs. When it comes to the use of mountains and hills, the orcs are obviously stronger than humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may not be easy to take down the Warhammer Kingdom, but as long as it is taken down, the Orc Empire has the possibility of sticking to it for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, even if the orcs took possession of the great plains like the Principality of Moxi, they would still have to throw them away as soon as the Terran Alliance army came over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One is to grab a wave in the early stage, and the other is to enhance the long-term benefits of racial strength. It is clear at a glance how to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After judging the movement of the orc army, Hudson found that he seemed to be unable to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the Warhammer Kingdom to raise its alert?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is pure bullshit. Not to mention why people should believe him, an unrelated person, even if they really believed it, the Warhammer Kingdom would not have time to build a line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deploying troops and generals is easy to say, but if you really want to implement it, you will encounter various problems. If you want a peaceful area to immediately become a war front, the coordination of food and supplies is a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The safer the area, the worse the military defense capability, which is a common problem of all nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Castles that can house all the citizens only exist in frontier war-prone areas, and the nobles in the rear build castles and fortresses to defend against their own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the orc army launches an attack, the land close to the Principality of Orton in the Warhammer Kingdom will fall, and then spread to the entire Warhammer Great Plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost the kingdom's only great plain, even if the Warhammer Kingdom wanted to keep resisting, food pressure would collapse them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not even possible to count on allies to help. The rest of the country is basically mountains and hills. Even if everyone has donated supplies, it is difficult to transport them to the front line in a short while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, Hudson quickly adjusted his mood. These things are obviously not what he needs to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life and death of Warhammer Kingdom will not affect Flying Bear Castle. As for the overall interests of the human race, that is a question that only the big shots above are qualified to consider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hodge, you came here in person, isn't it just to tell me the news?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that the Moxi people were planning to make trouble. Vaguely, he had already guessed a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for this kind of thing, he still wants to get an accurate answer from Marshal Hodge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, you really have eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yes, I came to visit you this time, mainly to ask about your views on the current situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the orcs has left, no matter where their ultimate goal is, we have a short period of time to usher in a respite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is to reduce the pressure on the Principality of Orton, or to reverse the unfavorable situation on the battlefield. In times like these, we all have to do something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone in the Principality's senior management proposed to take the opportunity to launch a big battle centered on Dapace, severely injuring the orc army that penetrated deep into the Principality's hinterland! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the reasons are nonsense, and the core meaning is \"breaking the siege of Dapez\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting the exact answer, Hudson fell into deep contemplation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the Principality of Moxi, solving the siege of Dapace is the most important strategy right now. But he is not a Moxi nobleman, so it is impossible to consider the issue from the standpoint of the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, you should know how difficult this plan is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, your country seems to have a lot of troops that can be mobilized, but there are not many main forces that can be mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the combat power of an ordinary army, once they encounter the main force of the orcs in the field, it is giving the enemy a record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the orcs still have more than 300,000 troops outside the city of Dapace. No matter how **** the combat power is, it can hold back 20 or 30 ordinary legions of yours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have also experienced the combat effectiveness of the undersized Beamon Cavalry Legion. A cavalry regiment can overwhelm an ordinary legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are not a few main forces, it may be difficult to win the victory if this Beamon cavalry is held back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To save face, then you have to share something. This kind of battle involving hundreds of thousands of troops will be a disaster if the problem is not considered and perfected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People change all the time. Originally with limited troops and unreliable teammates, Hudson naturally wanted to return home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But with the development of the situation, after getting used to this unrestrained freedom, Hudson gradually changed his position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going back to the country will also have to fight. Instead of obeying the orders of others, it is better to control your own destiny like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only can you make war fortune, but you can also take advantage of the chaos to accumulate strength. The spoils of robbing the orcs can be divided up in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the banner of an expeditionary force, it is also a routine operation to privately expand one's own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doing this in peaceful times has already caused an uproar. But now is the time of war, and the primary task of everything is to fight against the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathered the defeated soldiers from all over the world, and recruited Moxi's young and strong into the army. It seemed that they were all soldiers of the expeditionary army. In fact, the best soldiers among them all entered the private army of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson's operation was concealed enough, and he didn't directly put it under the name of his own team, but replaced the general officer with his own under the name of the regular army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the quality of soldiers under direct line officers is better, the weapons and equipment are better, and the treatment in other aspects is similar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This small difference is the same for almost all coaches, and it has not caused any waves at all. Maybe some smart people found out, but everyone tacitly didn't say it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss can secretly expand his strength, and the younger brothers can follow suit. The only difference is that they have no autonomy, and Hudson has to distribute the soldiers, so they cannot expand the army arbitrarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, it may not be long before the expeditionary force will restore the six legion system again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the front line, Hudson's small actions naturally cannot be hidden from Marshal Hodge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson gathered only routs and young men, and he didn't reach out to dig into the walls of Moxi's army, and didn't touch his bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to not being able to figure out Hudson's true purpose, the Principality of Moxi still needs the expeditionary force to work hard, so it can only choose to turn a blind eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the key to this battle is the expeditionary force. The Terence line of defense still has meaning. We can't lose these castles and fortresses. Even if we deploy troops, it is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can tell how effective the troops mobilized one after another in the country are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them deal with the ordinary orc army, maybe they can barely make do. If you encounter Beamon cavalry, you may collapse in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently the most suitable for dispatch. It is the expeditionary force under your command. Only the expeditionary army can hold the Beamon cavalry head-on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this plan, the Principality has decided to spend all its money. If you have any requirements, just ask! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge said rather helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and all the high-level officials in the Principality wanted to lift the siege of Dapes. But when it came time to take action, no one of the big nobles dared to take on this important task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Marshal Hodge himself, he also didn't dare to take the family's private army to head-on with the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do it yourself, you can only pin your hopes on the expeditionary army. Unlike the private army of the great nobles, the composition of the expeditionary army is much more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the thousands of private troops of the Koslow family who are direct descendants of Hudson, the rest are private troops of other nobles, or another name: Kingdom Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is the possibility of operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one would be willing to take risks with their own lineage; but taking risks with the kingdom's army is another matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a smart person. Marshal Hodge knows very well that Hudson is the one who can't afford it, so he simply hinted at the conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, this is not a question of whether your country will spend its money. Beamon cavalry come and go like the wind. If you want to stop them, you have to use cavalry against cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the combat effectiveness of the Beamon cavalry, it is impossible to defeat them without several times the cavalry. To be on the safe side, it is better to gather ten times their cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cavalry is insufficient, then we can only find a way from the equipment, for example: equip the cavalry with a light magic crossbow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or equip a large number of magic scrolls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it would be even better to have a group of magicians accompanying the army...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flickering with his mouth full of horses and carriages directly made Marshal Hodge dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to mobilize ten times as many cavalry as the Beamon Legion, the Principality of Moxi has already started to act, why bother to look down and ask for help?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is the ability to equip the army, the Principality of Moxi has already equipped the army. Why delay it until this moment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic crossbows need to be crafted by alchemists, and magic scrolls also need to be carved by magicians. Not to mention the cost of materials, purely handmade manufacturing restricts the production capacity of these weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magician regiment accompanied the army, let alone. As far as the pitiful number of magicians in the Principality of Moxi is concerned, it is difficult to restrain the shaman priests in the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, these requirements are too harsh. To tell you the truth, we can't do any of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that only a big kingdom like yours can come up with 100,000 cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magical crossbows and magic scrolls are equipped on a large scale. Perhaps the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See can equip some elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the principality can squeeze out 3,000 horses for you at most, and then deploy 8,000 cavalry to cooperate with you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war consumables in the magic crossbow and magic scroll can only be squeezed out after the assistance of the Human Race Alliance is in place. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lion is not afraid of opening his mouth wide, but he is afraid of the wild price bidding. No matter how much it costs to buy Hudson alone, it is cheaper than buying the entire expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that all the hints were in vain, and Hudson didn't take it at all, and none of the requests he made were reliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, if this is the case, then there is nothing I can do to help you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As you know, the expeditionary force has just experienced a major battle and is resting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, it is not suitable to participate in large-scale battles. How about we wait for the aid supplies from various countries to arrive before we take action? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sincerely suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a nobleman with a conscience, does he know what money can be received and what money cannot be taken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many nobles under his command are willing to hang out with him, what they value is that Master Hudson is lucky, able to win battles, has a good reputation, and never cheats his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation that has been painstakingly cultivated for many years, how can it be compensated for a little profit?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they look down on the Moxi people, it's because the war has consumed too much of their national power, and with the little wealth left in the end, they can't offer a sky-high price at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can't think that the assistance of the Human Race Alliance is free, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Real free aid has always been symbolic. More strategic materials have to be bought with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your country has the most experience in repaying debts with things without money. After every major war, debt piles up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the major forces in the Terran Alliance did not add insult to injury or drive up prices, the money that should be given is indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the governments of various countries have little support, it's simply that everyone's pockets are not very rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, the tax that the government can collect is very limited, and it is limited to maintaining daily expenses. Most of the financial resources are held in the hands of nobles everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless a war breaks out, it is difficult for the government to impose new taxes. Even if the king issued an order, the noble council would veto it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taxes that cannot be approved by the Parliament are all illegal taxes and cannot be recognized at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, let him settle the debts. After so many years, the Alpha Kingdom has survived. Are you still afraid of this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With all due respect, the situation in the Principality of Moxi is now very dangerous, and if you are not careful, the country will be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to survive this catastrophe, the most important thing your government should do now is to borrow heavily. Borrow as much as you can, and the more debt you owe, the better, especially if you want to borrow more money from the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you pay more interest, if you still have to pay it back, don't rush to think about it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only if you owe enough debts, the creditors will not be able to watch you fall, and the support from various countries will come in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if your country really falls, these creditors will help you up. Even this kind of action is still spontaneous, and they can't help but favor your country when making decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the debt hole is too big, and one day you really can't pay it off, you can still repay the debt with the land in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They definitely won't want it. If you make a gesture, everyone will extend your repayment period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are the biggest secrets that the Alpha Kingdom has been able to hold on to until now under the vanguard of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you didn't get along very well, I would never tell you. Even if I leave this door now, I will not admit to having said these words. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said flicking to his heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has been persevering, and it has nothing to do with debts at all, and it is impossible for the Kingdom to rely on creditors every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this does not prevent Hudson from being used to fool the Mossi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a person reaches a crisis point, he will choose to grab a straw when he sees it. What's more, Hudson also gave a good reason + case.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the operability is really high. As long as the money owed is enough, the creditors dare not watch them die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. Hudson was in the Principality of Moxi, and he relied on the Moxi people for money, food, materials, weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the benefactor has no money in his pocket, it also means that the good days of the expeditionary force are coming to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better resist the invasion of orcs and for his own better life, he can only work hard to bulge the pockets of the benefactor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resulting debt problem, anyway, he does not need to pay it back, so why bother to think so much?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, is this really feasible?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous cognition of life suddenly became insufficient at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson rolled his eyes directly, pretending to be annoyed and said: \"Okay, doesn't the marshal already have the answer in his heart?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing must be kept strictly confidential. Once it gets out, it may be difficult for your country to borrow money! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's all on the verge of life and death, no matter what the effect is, you have to try it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae that may be involved in the future must be able to live into the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After solving a problem, Hudson slowly opened the official document from the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rewards are a must. Although there is no way to calculate the military exploits in detail, the kingdom will not be stingy with verbal praise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the awards, the official conclusions of the two great victories came from the two countries, and the naming was still as lacking in artistry as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bethel Xiongren Royal Victory\", this name can't find any advantages other than being simple and easy to understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson can also understand that everyone's knowledge level is not high these days, and many low-level nobles are semi-literate, let alone serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is too complicated, everyone will sound confused, and it will not be effective in publicity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The official \"Bethel Bear Human Race Royal Victory\" not only explained the place where the war broke out, but also introduced the objects of the war and the significance of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the word \"imperial court\" is added, in the eyes of ordinary people, it must be extraordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the opinion of most people, it is far more convincing to lead troops to attack the Bearman Royal Court and **** their Royal Court Battle Banner than to severely damage several orc legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no surprises, the qualitative nature of the war is another \"turning point\" in the war with the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson's scalp tingled when he heard the word \"turning point\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the last time just after a wave of turning point was announced, the teammates immediately sent an epic defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the situation of the battle in the Principality of Orton has not yet been reported, experience tells Hudson that the battle situation there is absolutely impossible to be optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is an avalanche now. There is a high probability that the big victory he just won will be buried by the failure of his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has secretly prayed that the bad news will come later, otherwise it will make everyone connect the two things together, and it will be unclear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Principality of Orton, the bad news finally reached the capital, and it came with the news, as well as the orc army on its way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like a bolt from the blue, the high-level officials of the Principality of Orton were stunned. Although everyone didn't have much confidence in their own army to stop the orc army, the speed of the collapse came too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they have to resist for a few days, which proves that they also played a role. According to the current situation, even if the Human Race Alliance regains the lost ground in the future, nothing will happen to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weakness is the original sin. Even though there is a layer of rules on the outside, the law of the jungle is still followed in the essence of the Aslant Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orc army is coming, what should we do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orton XIX asked in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a salted fish monarch, he has never been interested in this kind of fighting. Now that the enemy is approaching the city, I naturally don't know how to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of the ministers was not much better. The greatest value of the front-line army is that it delayed the advance speed of the orc army with routs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Effective resistance is not without, but under the general trend of the collapse of the army, any personal efforts are futile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, there are still too few elites and too many recruits. The few soldiers who can fight have no chance to perform under the drag of their teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, at this point, we can only prepare for the defense of the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, we have to fight the orcs to prove the unyielding spirit of the Principality. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Jacob said bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words are hard to hear, but it is also the reality. If they don't show off on the battlefield, they won't be able to hang out in the noble circle in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only them, but the nobles of the entire Duchy of Orton will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times it doesn't matter if you lose a battle. If you lose a battle under the absolute strength gap, no one will laugh at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is how to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of collapse at the first touch, and losing the city and losing ground under fierce resistance, are completely two concepts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world of great conflict, nobles who cannot protect one side are cancerous to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister made it clear that he was going to die, and many of the ministers' faces darkened, but in the end, no one proposed to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't want to move the capital and run away, but the current situation doesn't allow them to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, all the nobles of the Principality of Orton have no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they still can't perform well in the next battle, the pack of wolves will not let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once she retreats, the status of the nobleman of the Duchy of Orton in the future will no longer be an honor, but a joke to be ridiculed by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't beat the orcs, you can only bite the bullet. The only thing that can wash away the shame is blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have enough strength, you can only show your tragic heroic side and win sympathy in the noble circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compassion can't be eaten, but when sympathy can make the major forces attack, it will leave a bowl of soup for the families behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Where are our reinforcements?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orton XIX asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, since you can struggle, you must struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that the orc army is coming fiercely, but the ones who come here are all elites, and they are not necessarily willing to use them to attack the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the call for help has just been sent out, and the countries have not yet responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the problem of distance, the reinforcements from most countries cannot quench their thirst near them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the countries bordering us, the Mosi people can't take care of themselves. The small countries in the west have limited strength, and they can't be counted on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ones who have the strength to lend a helping hand are the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that their performance in this war is not active, and it may not be easy to get their reinforcements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dubs said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weak countries have no diplomacy. As the foreign minister of a small country, Dubs has always been under pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maintaining daily international relations is still barely able to do so. Now if you want countries to send real reinforcements, it is definitely not something that can be done in a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Issuing a call-up order, let all the nobles of the principality gather in the capital, and fight to the death with the orcs!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the others, they will not be able to play any role if they stay, so let them escape by themselves! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orton XIX said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no hope of keeping the entire principality, so the only priority is to keep the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this is also a covert political exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the nobles abandon their territories and come over to participate in the battle to defend the capital, in exchange for the legal evacuation of their families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Orton XIX's order was spread, the refugee wave started ahead of schedule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing the brutality of the orcs, people from all over the Principality of Orton have already started to flee first without any organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rich ones left in a carriage, while the poor ones took all their possessions with one parcel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for some conscientious nobles who are still maintaining order, the social order in most parts of the Principality has collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless crimes are constantly being staged in this suffering country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Escape is also very particular. After seeing the horror of the orc army, everyone knows to choose a powerful country even if they are fleeing for their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good neighbor, the undefended Warhammer Kingdom naturally became the first choice for fleeing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The influx of countless refugees caused the mentality of the nobles in the border area of ​​the Warhammer Kingdom to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly expelling refugees away is not in line with the noble spirit. If it gets out, it will affect your reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give generously, but his pockets are not so big. Faced with a steady stream of refugees, there is no way to save them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, everyone can only make a bad move to lure the refugees to the hinterland of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a family of nobles can't afford the refugee wave, they should take everyone's responsibility together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and the Terran Alliance has regulations: In wars against alien races, all countries have the obligation to provide assistance to belligerent countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This also includes provisions for helping refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the enforcement is not very strong, the regulations are regulations after all, and they still need to be followed on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the Warhammer Kingdom is now one of the belligerent countries. Once the orcs fight over, they also need the assistance of all countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make a principled mistake at this time, you will get into trouble later, and it will be difficult to get help from other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under layers of conduction, the trouble soon fell into the hands of Joseph II.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rescue refugees?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, His Majesty the Great King is busy considering the sudden change in the situation on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle line of the orc army is stretched, which also means that the border between the Warhammer Kingdom and the orcs is stretched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After all, I still can't hide!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the outbreak of the war, he has saved a lot of face for the orcs. It's a pity that these guys didn't appreciate it at all, and pointed the butcher's knife at them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, sooner or later the kingdom will face the invasion of the orc army. It's just that the performance of the Mossi and the Ortons is too useless, which makes this war ahead of schedule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the trajectory of the orc army, it is almost certain that they will use the Principality of Orton as a platform to launch an attack on us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the long-term and friendly influence of the Principality of Orton, the kingdom did not invest too much energy on the western border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current situation, the orc army will definitely invade the kingdom within two months or ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too late to build a complete line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current plan, we can only deploy a few more temporary lines of defense to resist the slowing enemy's attack speed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he lacks strategic vision and didn't consider the defense of the western border in advance. The main reason is that the kingdom's financial, manpower, and material resources are limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just to build the line of defense with the Principality of Moxi, the Warhammer Kingdom mobilized half a million workers, almost reaching the limit of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the relatively safe western region, defense issues can only be dealt with later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to issuing an order to strengthen the guard to the nobles on the border, the Kingdom of Warhammer was simply unable to give more support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally planned to wait until the fortifications in the dangerous area were almost built, and then organize manpower to build a defense line in the west of the kingdom. Unfortunately, the enemy came too fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Building a temporary defense line is also possible. However, the military has to speed up, and it is necessary to complete the construction of the temporary defense line before the orc army launches an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient manpower, let the nobles on the border find a way. Don't they complain about the influx of refugees every day, so let them organize refugees to build fortifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It happens to restrain people in the border area, so as to prevent them from wandering around and affecting the security of all parts of the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the absence of enough castles and fortresses to accommodate refugees, confining people to the front line is to send their heads to the butcher knife of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is for the benefit of the kingdom. If you are unable to solve the troubles caused by refugees, you can only solve the troublesome refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, there is a Griffin Rider outside who claims to be a member of the Holliser family and has brought a letter from Miss Melissa.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the general in command, Hudson can barely be regarded as a high-ranking general now. Under normal circumstances, strangers are not eligible to seek a meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the current situation is special. The nobles in the southeastern province all know about his relationship with Melissa.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The letter sent by the coach's fiancée, everyone dare not suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you verified the identity of the visitor?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a cautious commander, he will not easily give strangers a chance to get close. Especially at this time, the letter came too coincidental.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he hasn't had much contact with Melissa, he still knows a little bit about it. Under normal circumstances, his fiancée would not mobilize people for a letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holliser family has a profound heritage, but they still don't have the ability to train griffins. The only few Griffin cavalry in the family were traded from the royal family at a high price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of long-distance and dangerous mission, not to mention a noble lady, even if Viscount Oran wants to call it, he must weigh one or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I've made sure, the person who came here is indeed a member of the Holliser family. Not only did he match the code word, but someone in the army knows him.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom said affirmatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting a definite answer, Hudson waved his hand and said, \"Since there is no problem with him, let's bring him here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In war, there is not so much tenderness. Even if it is a general in command, it is very difficult to communicate with his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Official documents can be sent to the kingdom by the Mosi people, but private letters from home are not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they are afraid of being used for private use, but the number of Griffin cavalry is too small to be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on a courier to send a message, it is normal to delay for a month in the middle. With such a long time interval, the content of the letter has become old news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that Hudson took the lead, and the nobles and nobles in the expeditionary army will follow suit. I am afraid that the soldiers who specialize in sending letters will have three figures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Miss Melissa and the Patriarch have specifically confessed that this secret letter can only be opened by you personally.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the person who came had already handed over the letter. It's just that Hudson didn't reach out to pick it up in a hurry, but released a magic to make the letter suspend in the air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that there was no problem, he slowly opened the letter. After a while, Hudson said slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go back and tell Viscount Oran that I already know the matter. It's just that the situation on the battlefield is unpredictable, and the real troubled times have just begun, and it is not appropriate to act rashly for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will explain the rest in the letter, and you will rest in the city for a day, and help me take a few letters back by the way. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson ordered again: \"Tom sent an order to block the news about today's affairs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that things are not visible, but mainly because they are afraid that after the news spreads, a bunch of nobles will run over with family letters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Griffin is a monster, its level is not very high. If there are too many letters, it will be embarrassing to find that you can't carry them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the nobles of the expeditionary army are distributed among the six provinces. This communication work is also a big project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the resources of the Holliser family as favors, it is impossible for them to have no opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of bad guy, Hudson will not do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking up the pen and about to write, Hudson suddenly found that he didn't know how to write.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He understood what the Holliser family meant, but it was just that he felt that there were not enough radish holes left in front of him, and he couldn't guarantee that his family would be able to fill them up, so he wanted to dig a few more holes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that the great nobles are not fools. It is a miracle that a fool like Duke Liufeng can meet one. It would be too whimsical to expect all the great nobles to be of this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the **** is right, the hole will be dug down. If the **** is swung sideways, it is likely that it is your own foot that digs down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be a tragedy if it didn't kill the family, but provoked a big enemy for the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During all previous battles, there were many incidents where teammates cheated on each other. But this kind of thing is not now, but during the big counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall situation on the battlefield has been decided. Even if a few families are killed, it will not affect the overall situation of the victory of the war. Only then can everyone have the mind to engage in internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, in this kind of mutual pit game, nobles who are good at military command can often have an advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most miserable ones are usually military novices. Many times they don't know what happened, and they are sold out in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that someone gave her a lie, and I don't know who did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson was not prepared to get involved in such a bad thing, but judging from the current situation, it seems that he still cannot escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was okay when we were in the Principality of Moxi. Everyone did not share the same cake, and there was no conflict of core interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a foreign general like him who can affect the development of the situation, it is too late for everyone to win him over, and they will not offend him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you return to China to participate in the counterattack against the Orc Empire, the situation will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of a serious shortage of radish pits, in addition to pitting the great nobles in front, they also have to pit potential competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of interests, perhaps Hudson himself can remain rational, but there is no guarantee that others will be equally rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pick up the pen and write it down again, and a letter will be completed soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thank you, the leader of ELvin2016, I owe more +...

The Moxi people, who decided to borrow money to save the country, quickly exploded with unparalleled potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the great nobles in the country, including the royal family, came down to sell bonds for the Principality one after another. The first batch of people who were fooled were naturally relatives and friends abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no choice but to catch my own family. There is no way, the circle of big nobles is only that big.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply impossible to play with the marriages of several major families in China, and cross-border marriages have become inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The established targets are all our own people, so naturally the sales target can only be our own people. As for the problem of future troubles, let's talk about keeping the family business first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the promised high interest rate, but the payment of real money, is not a pure advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Moxi has no intention of reneging on debts now, and even has a repayment plan in place. After the war ended, the Principality began to levy a \"repayment tax\", which was paid by all citizens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the specific rules have not been issued, the sincerity is still full. These bonds will be honored as long as the Principality of Moxi can exist after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of an accident and the principality is lost, that is another story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    High risks lead to high returns. If you want to obtain excess returns, you must bear the risk of losing your money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, Hudson also contributed to the special financing of the Moxi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The just-concluded \"Bethel Bear Race Royal Victory\" has greatly increased the confidence of the market. Coupled with the strong power of the Terran Alliance, everyone is still very optimistic about the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are the major international forces, Hudson does not know. Anyway, among the nobles in the expeditionary army, many people have already jumped into the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Raquel who was selling bonds to him, Hudson's face was completely dark. The idea was given by him, but he still wanted to trick him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this also proves from the side that the Moxi people have been reliable this time, and have kept the strategy of borrowing money to save the country highly confidential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Raquel, you know that since I took office, I have nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I have received a lot of spoils, my daily expenses have always been very large, and I have very little savings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, I am still willing to contribute to the fundraising cause of your country. That's all right, I will subscribe for 10,000 gold coins for the bonds issued by your country. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has already made up his mind that he will get back what he has paid now by a hundred times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for political needs, he wouldn't even want to give out the ten thousand gold coins. As for his subordinates being cheated, Hudson selectively pretended not to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, the noble officers with a lot of money will inevitably lose their sense of fighting on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is almost the common trouble of all bosses. On the one hand, he wants to use money to stimulate the younger brothers to work hard, and on the other hand, he is worried that the younger brothers are too rich and lose their sense of initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, there are even more things to worry about. The little brothers have too much money in their pockets, and they will be transformed into military strength after returning to China.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the boss, this is definitely not a good thing. Especially for Hudson, who wanted to regain his life, it was a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family has everything, and went to live a happy life by themselves. Why do you have to work hard and come to work for him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people can take the money from the pockets of the younger brothers, and Hudson is also happy to see it. This means eliminating two hassles at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about the younger brothers becoming bigger after the war and out of the control of his boss; it also prevents these guys from passively slowing down their work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buying the bonds of the Mosi people with a lot of money means binding yourself to the fate of the Moxi Principality. In the ensuing battle, Hudson basically had no problems with the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the benefits are touching. If he hadn't known in advance that there was a pitfall, Hudson couldn't help being tricked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The annual interest rate of 30%, and the government's credit endorsement, have long exceeded the normal loan among nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all caused by the social environment. Most of the nobles were ruled by serfs, and the number of free people was extremely rare. From the source, the vigorous development of usury was suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little profit is not worth the nobles giving up their glory to engage in such shady activities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to make money from the free people, they are selling the lending rights to businessmen, rather than end themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Borrowing in the aristocratic world rarely defaults. It is almost a zero-risk transaction, and because of the relationship, the interest on the loan is usually not too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people even designed the repayment plan clearly this time, no matter how you look at it, it is full of sincerity. It is not surprising that the nobles who have not suffered from breach of contract have been tricked by this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they only know that the Principality of Moxi is full of sincerity in repaying the loan, but they don't know how much money they borrowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the current Moxi people are still restrained and have not blindly printed bonds, but Hudson is sure that once this kind of thing sets a precedent, it will not be controlled later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the biggest gold-swallowing beast, and no one knows how much money will be spent next. When there is no money in their pockets, everyone tries to save money and cut the budget in a fancy way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is money in the treasury, many unnecessary expenses will no longer be restrained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention other things, the purchase of weapons and equipment alone will increase the cost by several times, or even ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insufficient food and grass, buy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not enough armor, buy it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not enough war horses, buy them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic scroll is easy to use, buy it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crossbow is powerful, buy it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic Crystal Cannon is suitable for defending the city, buy it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all about winning the war, so spending money is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final outcome of \"buy, buy, buy...\" must be the rapid expansion of financial expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you run out of budget, keep borrowing. The issue of repayment is a matter of the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps when they realized the pressure of repayment, the Principality of Moxi had already embarked on the road of no return by borrowing new ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What determines the final result is not everyone's willpower, but how long this war will last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war lasted for a short time. With the wealth of the Principality of Moxi, it would not be difficult to repay the debt in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if it is delayed for three to five years, it is not a question of repayment, but when the debt hole will burst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things haven't happened yet, Hudson will naturally not say such unpleasant words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the vested interests, not only can't expose it, but also cooperate with the Moxi people to sell the bonds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too risky to go off the platform in person, and a small purchase for a show is enough. In case of a debt storm, he is also a \"victim\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson perform, Viscount Raquel's heart was broken. A person who can even sell his military exploits is ashamed to say that he has a breeze in his sleeves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is not known exactly how much money Hudson made, the hundreds of thousands of gold coins shared by the spoils of war are clearly on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"expenses are high\" made him speechless. All the expenses of the expeditionary force were paid by the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, all expenses of Hudson are taken from the public account, and he has no chance to spend money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if it is not convenient at hand, you can actually buy it in other ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bounty of the last war was not paid out as scheduled because of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Your Excellency the Earl is willing, we can directly convert it into war bonds. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laquer bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling bonds to Hudson is not essentially about taking money out of his pocket, but more for political propaganda.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is no secret that the wealth that the bear people painstakingly robbed fell into the hands of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as Hudson is willing to take the lead in buying bonds, the sales below will be much smoother, far easier than their door-to-door sales.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raising military expenditures is second, and the key is to deeply bind the expeditionary force. If all the expeditionary forces bought their war bonds, would they not be able to solve the siege of Dapace?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to achieve strategic goals, it is necessary to get Hudson. If the fooling is unsuccessful, then real gold and silver will be thrown at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I will use all the rewards to subscribe to your country's war bonds and contribute to this just war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I hope that your country will purchase a batch of war horses and ordnance as soon as possible after obtaining sufficient war funds to supplement the front-line troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bounty was not paid out as scheduled. Apart from the war, the bigger reason was that the Principality of Moxi had no money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the financial problems are not resolved, the bounty will never be honored. Converting it into war bonds now is nothing more than turning dead assets into high-risk assets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high-risk assets still have the possibility of cashing in. If the Moxi people perform well, they may be able to find someone who is taken advantage of halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these illusory wealth, Hudson valued weapons and equipment that could have immediate results and enhance the strength of the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since winning \"The Great Victory of the Bethel Bear Race\", Hudson has successively gathered another 3,000 defeated soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that after these guys sneaked away, they found that the life of wandering was not easy, and after seeing the opportunity to commit crimes and make meritorious service, they chose to return to the camp of the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding the thigh is not ashamed, they are all adults, and Hudson will naturally not be serious about these issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the gathered broken soldiers, together with officers drawn from several other legions, and 3,000 young men drawn from the city defense regiment, they quickly set up the airs of the Fourth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The composition of the defeated army is complex, and the proper four-nation coalition army will naturally have no hope of combat effectiveness for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't be the main force, then you can be the auxiliary soldier. Master Hudson, who is used to seeing big scenes, doesn't think there are too many soldiers now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the orc royal family, the physical strength of human soldiers is far inferior. Even if the main force is against the main force, when the strength of both sides is equal, the human army will still suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to make up for this gap, you can only rely on weapons and equipment. As the overlord of the mainland, the human race is definitely the leader in terms of civilization development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare that countries in the mainland are willing to relax restrictions. If they don't take the opportunity to produce a batch of high-end goods and want to obtain them after the war, it will not only be a question of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to have more and more advanced equipment, and to speak harder after the war, it is imperative to continue to expand the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of soldiers, Hudson has already sent an official document to the kingdom. He had just won the battle, and the country had to consider his opinion as a frontline general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if no reinforcements are sent, supplements for battle damage will still be provided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Replenish some at home, and then find a chance to get some from the Principality of Moxi. It is only a matter of time before the expeditionary force resumes its organizational system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With military exploits and an army of more than 100,000, it is an important force no matter where it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia, Charles III, who successfully led the Human Race Alliance meeting, has been enjoying a lot of glory recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that as time goes by, he is still tired of the endless wrangling within the league.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all decided to use the orcs to scare chickens and monkeys, but they got stuck again on the issue of the distribution of troops among countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the bottom of his heart, he looked down on those congressmen who were penny-pinching. Everyone only knows how to focus on their own small interests, and has no view of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the continent, the territory occupied by the human race is actually only one-third of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is possible to suppress a group of alien races, that is because the land occupied by the human race is more fertile, and the areas occupied by alien races are mostly mountains, grasslands, deserts, deserts, ice and snow worlds...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This advantage is based on the fact that the different races are fighting on their own. Once the races are united, the human race is the one to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to eliminate the danger once and for all, the best way is to suppress the most powerful races among the alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the few races that have been the hegemons of the world, they are the targets that need to be targeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After solving these hidden dangers, the remaining small races are nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the interior is stabilized, the next 100,000 years of catastrophe can be hoped to pass smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Moxi people have been very active recently, constantly selling war bonds to the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the super high interest rate, many nobles in the kingdom have made large subscriptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number is unknown, but from various indications, they sold millions of war bonds in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the money, they kept sweeping the market. The prices of all war-related materials have risen to varying degrees. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Bergson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that in the \"sell, sell, sell\" and \"buy, buy, buy\" of the Moxi people, he did not make less profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, as long as the war bonds can be paid normally, all the great nobles will be the beneficiaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have to do things when you receive money. A huge purchase order is not just a simple purchase, but also an invisible public relations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now to bring up the matter, it is because Bergson knows that his king wants all countries to send troops as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight, and taking the opportunity to weaken the strength of the three northern powers, Charles III didn't even bother to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything stems from strength. As the most powerful country on the mainland, the Frankish Kingdom has sufficient advantages over its pursuers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of population, politics, economy, military, and culture, it is an all-round transcendence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of a single family is stronger than the three major northern countries combined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the Alpha Kingdom is a partial science student. Only its military strength has been trained by the orcs, and it can rank among the top three kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other aspects of strength, it is impossible to see. The country that fought with the orcs every now and then had no time to distract him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I've heard about the big money of the Mosi people in the palace. Their war bonds were also sold to the royal family, but considering the political influence, the royal family didn't buy much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs really pushed them into a hurry this time. They even figured out the repayment tax, and even the nobles in their country didn't object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also a good thing. Since the Moxi people are so active, then we will give them some convenience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to buy something, let them buy it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are constantly happening in many human countries. The dignitaries of various countries who have received the benefits strongly support the Moxi people's buying and buying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even when the Terran Alliance provided material assistance to the major warring countries in the north, the Principality of Moxi ranked first for some reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Absolutely all voluntary actions of congressmen. As soon as the topic came up at the Human Race Alliance meeting, it was passed by a high number of votes, and there was no time for public relations at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The obvious reason is that the situation in the Principality of Moxi is the most dangerous, and it urgently needs the help of the Terran Alliance. As for the real reason behind it, there is no need to go into details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The banners fluttering in the wind are already tattered and tattered, as if they will fall in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the city tower, there are dead bodies lying on the ground. The wounded were bleeding profusely, but no one moved forward to clean them up. The strong smell of blood and sweat mixed with each other and filled the air, making it pungent and unpleasant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames of war finally reached the city of Oster. The nobles of the Principality of Orton, who had no way out, unleashed their greatest potential at the critical moment of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loud screams and screams are touching. Led by the nobles in the city, the blood-stained Orton soldiers let out a heart-piercing cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of shouting, contagious and encouraging each other, dispelled many inexplicable fears in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrows flew wildly in the air, dragging a long rain of arrows, cutting through the clear sky like locusts crossing the border, parrying the orc soldiers who were besieging the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Catapults, magic crystal cannons, and all kinds of crossbow bolts were flying around for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The powerhouses of both sides are also fighting fiercely at this moment. Dou Qi flies and magic dances. The scene was so horrifying that one could get chills just by looking at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Screaming screams, crazy killings, and fiery beacons made the soldiers of the two armies even more angry, and the war became more and more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle of Oster City this time also seemed to be the most difficult battle since the orc army entered the Principality of Orton. The setting sun was like blood, and the afterglow of the setting sun poured over the city tower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order to stop the siege!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The offensive and defensive battle lasted only one day, and the orc army paid four-digit losses. This is not the previous cannon fodder unit, but the elite of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best time to attack the city has been missed, and the nobles in the city recovered from their panic. If you continue to attack, even if you win Oster City, it will not be worth the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, we managed to reach the top of the city with great difficulty. Why did we suddenly order to stop the attack?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at the angry visitor, Duke Daniel replied arrogantly: \"Count Purvi, are you questioning me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, now I'm the coalition coach. To give an order, there is no obligation to explain it to you. All you need to do is obey orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the first and last time! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cold voice made the furious Pulvi turn off his fire at once. After calming down, cold sweat broke out from his back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nickname of \"Duke of Cold Face\" is not just for being indifferent. Accompanied by it, there is ruthless killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is it decisive to kill the enemy, but it is also the same for one's own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the embarrassment of the scene, the commander of the Eagle clan, Battelle, who came with him, persuaded him: \"Your Excellency, Earl Pulvi was just excited for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, in order to rush to the top of the city, the bear army paid a lot of losses, and now it is understandable to stop suddenly and feel emotional in the heart. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is also somewhat dissatisfied with Duke Daniel's order. It's just that the city is deeper, and he didn't ask questions as soon as he came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since you want to know, let me tell you. I think you haven't forgotten the old things about Bethel Fortress!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the outbreak of the siege battle to the present, their magic crystal cannons have never stopped, and the magic scrolls are also thrown out for free, regardless of the cost of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles of Orton in the city have already been cornered by us. If you didn't choose to run away, you were planning to fight us to your death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be blinded by your poor perception. After all, the human race is the overlord of the continent. Although they are falling apart, their inheritance cannot be underestimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we don't have enough cannon fodder troops to use. If we fight against them with an elite army, even if we can conquer the city in front of us, the subsequent plans will be impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the Principality of Orton was not our target. The main reason for launching this siege was the poor performance of their army before, which made us feel that we could win in one battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous battle has proved that our judgment was wrong. The enemy's determination to resist is much stronger than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is a mistake, it must be corrected in time now, and we cannot continue on the wrong path. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Daniel explained almost mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just arrogance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, he did it on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces were already full of intrigue. If the coach was not strong enough, the battle would be impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to lead the team well, you have to beat all the generals of the other three tribes to erect the majesty of the coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has soldiers in their hands, and it is definitely not enough to directly force them to stand up. Then it can only be suppressed mentally to establish his commander-in-chief status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, Duke Daniel was instilling in several people: You are not capable, and you must obey the commander's orders when fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current explanation is more like an IQ crush. Tell the three people with actual cases: You are all too stupid to see such an obvious problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future, for military command issues, just follow the orders of the commander-in-chief, and stop thinking wildly and pretending to be smart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoning the city of Oster, the orc army did not stay in the Principality of Orton, and went directly to the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waxus, as one of the important northern provinces of the Alpha Kingdom, has always been the focus of orc attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This war is no exception. From the very beginning of the war, this place has been taken care of by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It lasted until the orcs divided their troops into the Principality of Moxi, and the situation here eased a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This relaxation is also relative. The Alpha Kingdom still attracts most of the troops of the Orc Empire and is under the greatest pressure of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the ongoing war, most of the land in Huaxus province fell into the hands of orcs. The few remaining fortresses are also crumbling under the attack of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you at this point again?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Aarondo murmured to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous orc invasions, the Alpha Kingdom inevitably adopted the strategy of \"trading space for time\". Constantly use the castle fortress along the way to slow down the attack speed of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the past, this war is considered good. With two more unlucky guys to share the pressure, the military pressure facing Huaxus Province has also been reduced a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, Waxas fell within three to five months after the outbreak of the war; this time the war broke out for nearly ten months, and the Waxas province is still holding on, which is considered a broken record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how strong the city defense is, it will eventually be worn out one day. After days of fighting, the fortresses on the front line were almost destroyed by the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after arranging a defense change, the Duke of Aarondo has decided to retreat to his lair, fulfill his duty as a lord, and be a good householder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out. The disparity in strength is poor, and the defenders can only rely on castle fortresses to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Actively attacking to find a decisive battle opportunity, that is only a small probability event, most of the time they are defending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he is at a disadvantage, if he wants to survive, he naturally cannot place his lair in a battleground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to take the initiative to run away. The kingdom does not allow anyone to be a deserter. Even the five powerful dukes of the Northland also need to abide by the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to make a strategic shift, you have to do it after the city is broken. Often when the battle situation develops to this point, the defenders on the front line have already suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous wars, the nobles and lords in the Northern Xinjiang region will suffer heavy losses. This is the doomed end from the beginning of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power accumulated over decades has been wiped away in one battle after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the fate of generations of Northern Border lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dark night, hidden in a dilapidated private house in the corner of the city, more than a dozen young and strong men are gathering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a weird meeting, if people meet, they will definitely be mistaken for a cult organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the same is true. Since its establishment, the July Society has been living in the dark under the name of a cult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with cult organizations, the July Society never engages in blood sacrifices and does not promote the belief in evil gods. It's just that the ideas they spread are more terrifying than cult organizations in the eyes of the rulers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Longxi!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Longxi!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone stood up one after another, rushing to say hello. It can be seen that this is respect from the heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After responding to everyone's questions with a smile, Long Xi came to his exclusive seat and sat down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is here, so today's meeting will start in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all know the situation in the city. Half of the outer city had collapsed, and even if the defenders made a timely gamble, the deterioration of the situation was still unavoidable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, our Duke Arondo is ready to break out and leave. The destination, of course, is their family lair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity for revenge has come. Since this guy no longer undertakes the important task of guarding Waxus, then we don't have to be polite to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just take his head to pay homage to our dead ancestors. By the way, clean up the portal for my human race. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi's words made everyone's eyes shine. The July Society was originally composed of dilapidated nobles, and it had a deep hatred with the five dukes of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that it is the flesh and blood of the small and medium-sized nobles in the North that have created the glory of the five noble families in the North.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that hatred is hatred, and some principled issues still cannot be violated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business with orcs on weekdays is just a small matter. If you have anything to do with orcs at this time, it will be rebellious for adults.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you are labeled with this kind of label, you will never be able to stand up again. Everyone ventured out to join the July Society, just for revenge, but never thought of betraying the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Longxi, the old tortoise in Aarondo is very timid. There are many masters around him. Even if he is running for his life in a hurry, I am afraid that the number of guards will still be indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to ambush him on the way, our strength alone may not be enough. Unless we can kill with a knife, let the orcs do it for us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eagle-eyed man couldn't help but suggest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been in the northern Xinjiang area for a long time, he has dealt with orcs, so naturally he does not lack the relationship there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only because of the war that the two sides temporarily cut off contact. If you want to contact, you can still continue on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hawkeye, I know you are eager for revenge. But it's better not to be too eager for this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fire cannot be contained in paper. We can secretly leak the whereabouts of Aarondo, but we absolutely cannot contact the orcs directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brothers, it's not easy. After finally waiting for an opportunity, everyone is preparing to rebuild the family's glory. We can't take risks at this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Long Xi shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The proposal was rejected, and the eagle-eyed man was not lost. It is this prudence that the July Society can develop and grow in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some things can be done, but they must not be stated explicitly. In his opinion, leaking Aarondo's whereabouts is not directly different from directly colluding with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But politically, these are really two completely different situations. The former can also set up a maze to cover up, and the latter will be cold once the July meeting is leaked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everyone is a child of the Northland. While the feud with the five giants is as deep as the sea, there is no shortage of blood feud with the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they really colluded with the orcs, the July Society would fall apart. This is different from doing business in the orc empire in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that they colluded with the nobles of the beasts to make the slave trade smoother. Even if the reputation of the slave trader is not good, everyone can comfort themselves that this is attacking the orcs and avenging their ancestors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar episodes are constantly being staged in different northern Xinjiang lands, but everyone is targeting different goals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the July Club hiding in the dark, wanting to avenge the five giants, but the reinforcements are also full of their enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exiled Northland nobles in the south in the past, after so many years of development, many families have rejuvenated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if a family has feuds. If there are too many enemies, even the great nobles can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of small movements in the dark, like an undercurrent hidden underground, continuously hit the five major families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flying Bear Castle, Master Hudson, who is busy training the army, is in a very good mood now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just now, he received an official reply from the kingdom: 50,000 new recruits will be added to the expeditionary force one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to strengthen the connection between the two parties, the kingdom even sent a five-member Griffin Squad to follow the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the kingdom's decision, it can be seen that the expeditionary force has gradually risen from a dispensable miscellaneous army to an important armed force of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, the status of the army was created by itself. Often the more prominent the military exploits and the more elite the troops, the greater the resource tilt they receive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a positive cycle. Once the 50,000 supplementary soldiers arrive, the six reinforced legions of the expeditionary force will be full, and even exceed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this 100,000-strong team can be trained, Hudson will have enough voice in the following troubled times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though most of them are the army of the kingdom. But as long as they accept his command, the mutual love will be there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of network of contacts gained after experiencing life and death together on the battlefield is stronger than the usual twenty years of operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is well managed, this is a natural political faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fight a few more victories, everyone will become the hero of the kingdom, and there will always be some nobles who will achieve a class transition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the faction grows stronger, the biggest beneficiary is naturally the leader Hudson. If one becomes an official in the central government, there is a high probability that one can gain the position of a powerful minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Good news always came one after another. Not only did the domestic reinforcements come, but the Mosi people gave an accurate answer: they agreed to the proposal to add weapons and equipment to the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that their war bonds are selling well. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Hudson to form a cavalry corps in the expeditionary force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guest army is the guest army after all, don't look at everyone fighting together now, once the war is over, they will part ways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People risked their lives and came to help fight the war. They can't get back the weapons and equipment they gave out, can they?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of immoral thing, if you start a bad start, who will come to help if you encounter trouble in the future!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the sudden generosity of the Moxi people probably included the reward from the previous incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Equivalent exchange is popular in the noble world. The plan given by Hudson is reliable and has achieved phased results, so it is natural to give corresponding rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that all promises are now just promises. It will take a long time to implement it concretely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The recent update is not good enough, and Haiyue is also very worried. She is locked at home every day, and she doesn't know where her inspiration has gone. I miss the days of sunshine and small rivers\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Hudson was already powerless to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is the price of \"soldiers in storage, horses in Nanshan\". A comfortable and comfortable environment is always easy to let people relax their vigilance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be another story if they had carried out national mobilization early instead of pinning their own safety on the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes in the Principality of Orton also affected the expeditionary army, and the destruction of the country and family was imminent, and the Orton officers and soldiers in the expeditionary army were panicked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how flustered it is, it's useless, the water can't quench the near thirst. What's more, in the face of the main army of orcs, even if they pull the expeditionary army up, it is the fate of being hammered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to appease the morale of the army, but in the end Hudson chose to let it go. This is also a silent test.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A capable officer will solve the morale problem of his subordinates by himself, instead of just coming to trouble him as a commander with problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the tragedy of the Principality of Orton is also an opportunity for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world of highly monopolized knowledge, talents are almost all gathered within the ruling group, and talent overflow will only occur when the country is ruined and the family is destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, there was not much hope for poaching the wall, but the homeless Orton nobles in the expeditionary force had the possibility of being subdued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, it depends on the development of the situation. With the Principality of Moxie and the Kingdom of Warhammer standing in front of them, the land of the Principality of Orton is no longer counted as the front line. The problem of safety itself is far less serious than that of the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation this time was completely an accident. Under normal circumstances, the situation in the Principality of Moxi should not have deteriorated so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as a relatively solid line of defense is built, the security of the Principality of Orton is still guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of security is not a good thing for the Orton nobles. This means that their land has a value worthy of peeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance helped regain the lost ground, and that also required paying a price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you may be able to keep the name of the country, and everyone will just open some branch trumpets to share a piece of the pie; if you are unlucky, you may be directly dismembered by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the situation is, they are cutting the flesh of the local nobles of Orton. There will always be a group of unlucky nobles who will lose their family fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to be sent out to reinforce the Principality of Moxi, he did not do well in the Principality of Orton. If such a tragic event happens, there is a high probability that they will become the first victims.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of this, Hudson has deliberately begun to observe the reactions of the Orton nobles, preparing to select available talents from them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is also speechless. After traveling for several years, I don't even have a decent team of talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering things, Hudson has always made his own decisions. It is very difficult to find someone to discuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to recruit talents, Hudson also spent a lot of effort, but the final result is very touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to recruiting some basic talents, there is no real big talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a declining nobleman, the first person they choose to defect to is the king, followed by the great nobles in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was Hudson's turn, he had already been screened countless times. It's normal if you don't meet them, but if you really meet them, there will be problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is news from the front that the Duke of Aarondo was attacked and killed by an orc master while he was out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost at the same time, Duke Pias, Duke Agiron, Duke Dias, and Duke Cavadia were also attacked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, the four companies are strictly blocking news, and the specific situation is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Marshal Campbell, who was in the barracks, was assassinated. Fortunately, the old marshal was strong and was not succeeded by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, many frontline generals were assassinated by the enemy, and as many as seven people died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Assassin identities are also varied, there are races, orcs, elves, dwarves, demons, undead...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the report of Grand Duke Afiero, Caesar III's face instantly turned livid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination of one person may be an accident, but it is absolutely impossible for so many people to be assassinated at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aside from other things, just controlling the whereabouts of so many people is not so easy to accomplish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless there is internal and external collusion, otherwise it is possible to complete\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who is the black hand? How did these assassins sneak in?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who were assassinated were all big shots, and the guards around them were definitely not weak. The arrangement is from my own family, and the possibility of being bribed by outsiders is very small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the fact that the Duke of Aarondo was attacked by orc masters, which was slightly normal, the rest of the assassination cases were all foggy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"From the current situation, the orcs are the most suspected. However, given the hatred between the human race and the orcs, they absolutely do not have the ability to plant so many insiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the identities of the assassins are varied, and the Orc Empire family may not have the ability to control so many people at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most worrying thing is that these assassins, except for the sudden appearance of the undead, the rest are slaves and servants, lurking in early. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the incident happened in the military, it does not mean that the Ministry of Military Affairs can figure out the situation. The great nobles have their own private army around them, and their personal safety is also the responsibility of their own private army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information obtained by the Ministry of Military Affairs is all the specific details of the assassination given by them, and only these parties know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the five local snakes, except for the definite death of Duke Arondo, the remaining four don't even know whether they are dead or alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to track down the murderer, it is not up to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Without the cooperation of these great nobles, it would have been impossible to proceed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone deliberately resisted the investigation, the main reason is that before the matter was found out, each family lacked the most basic trust.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimating this time, they all looked like murderers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the crisis of confidence is eliminated, it will be difficult for the Ministry of Military Affairs to fully intervene. There is no way, everyone has a lot of black history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if it doesn't explode, but once the cover is uncovered, it will be a major political accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no time to fight internally during the war, these dark histories after the war are also the target of political enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the five major families in northern Xinjiang would rather investigate by themselves than the Ministry of Military Affairs to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Caesar III said angrily: \"I don't want to hear so many explanations, the man behind the scenes must be found out as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the guys in Beijiang that either they find the murderer for me themselves, or they will fully cooperate with the kingdom's investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also front-line issues, which the Ministry of Military Affairs must pay attention to. With so many accidents happening all at once, the orcs will definitely not give up this opportunity. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a chance, Caesar III would not mind knocking the five northern Xinjiang families into dust, but it is definitely not now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how annoying the five major families in Northern Xinjiang are, their military strength is real. They still played an important role in resisting the invasion of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these companies acting as barriers, the flames of war would soon spread to the hinterland of the Alpha Kingdom, and the resulting losses would definitely be astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Archer, let go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hold it, stand it up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames of war finally reached the Warhammer Kingdom. Facing the menacing orc army, the defenders performed much better than the Ortons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defense line was still not completed, at least a lot of traps for the orc cavalry were dug, and multiple wooden fences were set up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defense is not as good as a castle fortress, but it is better than nothing. The simple lines of defense one after another failed to stop the pace of the orc army, but slowed down their advancing speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One legion was defeated, and another legion went up, but unfortunately the final fate was the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the ever-increasing number of casualties, the Warhammer Kingdom is also under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, you have seen the number of casualties on the front line. According to the current situation, I am afraid that our troops deployed on the southern line will be wiped out soon!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that his dissatisfaction with Marshal Borg has accumulated to the breaking point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kings are realistic, if the pillar of the kingdom is not able to turn the tide, it is no longer a pillar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Past achievements are completely worthless in the face of reality. If there were no better options, he would have been replaced long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg, who was the party involved, was also full of anger. If it was caused by his strategic problems, it would be fine to take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the strategy he formulated did not go wrong. If it hadn't been for the strengthening of the frontline defenses of the Principality of Moxi, the enemy would have already entered, and there was no need to make a big detour all the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was the threat from the southern front, he had raised it early, but the problem was that the kingdom's strength was limited, and it was unable to take care of so many places at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited resources need to be distributed in unlimited defense areas, no matter how they are deployed, there will be loopholes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the front line of the Principality of Orton was defended, the enemy would have to detour for hundreds of miles. The allies are not strong enough to allow the enemy to sweep all the way, what can they do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not enough fortifications, just some simple facilities. To stop the pace of the orc army, the frontline army is not collapsed at the first touch, that is the result of everyone's desperate efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, what are you going to do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is a master with a temper. As a veteran of the kingdom, he will not take the blame for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    cannot solve the problem, it is the strength of the kingdom. The corruption in the current situation was not caused by his blind command, so there is no need to feel guilty at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orc army from the south has a total strength of no more than 100,000, of which 30,000 are ordinary wolf cavalry, and the real elite is only 70,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of how the orc army has fought against each other all the way, the losses they have paid are definitely not small. The current total strength is around 90,000 at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concentrate the troops in the southern and central provinces of the kingdom, deal with them slowly, and wait for the opportunity to find a decisive battle! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This strategic plan was drawn up by his think tank after much deliberation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, under the full mobilization of the southern and central provinces of the Warhammer Kingdom, an army of 600,000 to 700,000 people can be organized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the advantage of several times the strength of the enemy, it is completely capable of fighting. Don't expect to be able to win quickly, as long as it delays for a while, this orc army will be the turtle in the urn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, you are too optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles in the southern provinces never thought that one day the enemy would come out from behind, and their preparations were seriously insufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The call-up order has been issued for so long, and the mobilization of the provinces has not been completed. I am afraid that the orcs will be killed before the army gathers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if we can muster an army, we won't be able to stop the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a lone army, they were originally responsible for making trouble, and they would never fight us decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tear a hole at random, and the enemy will come all the way from south to north. Most of the enemies are cavalry, and the ordinary army can't catch up with them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a simple cavalry duel, the kingdom's military superiority is not so obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Busy concentration of troops to fight the enemy will only lead to a faster defeat. It's better to let nobles from all over the world rely on castles and fortresses to continuously harass the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, we can also shrink our forces and retreat to the west of the kingdom. Warhammer If the Great Plains enemies want it, give it to them first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the strength of the kingdom still exists, we can still get back the lost territory now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He also doesn't want to give up Warhammer Plains if possible. But there is no way, the real strength of the Warhammer Kingdom is not as powerful as it seems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was just an army of orcs who went deep alone, he was still sure to defeat it. The problem is the military pressure they need to bear, and the northern and eastern fronts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the kingdom has been restrained, and only a gang of mobs, what can they use to fight the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Abandoning the Warhammer Great Plains and retreating to the western mountains of the kingdom. Although this decision is difficult, it is the best choice to resolve strategic passiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, do you know how much the Kingdom will have to pay for abandoning the Great Plains of Warhammer?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nearly 70% of the population of the Kingdom lived on the Warhammer Great Plains. There is no way to evacuate in a short period of time. Once we retreat, we will expose these people to the butcher knives of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your territory is in the western region, so it doesn't have much influence, but what about the nobles on the Warhammer Great Plains? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Prime Minister Gay's angry questioning, Marshal Borg sighed and replied solemnly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm not blind, so I naturally know what the Great Plains of Warhammer means to the kingdom. But the problem now is that the orcs are targeting us this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the three northern countries, the Moxi Principality has no danger to defend, and it is not a place to live for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is so powerful that they won't be able to eat it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is most suitable for the orc empire is the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they won't be able to defend the Warhammer Great Plains, but the western mountains are different. As long as they eat it, they are likely to digest it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom concentrates its strength and sticks to it, with the advantage of terrain, it can also block the front of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight the orcs first, and then want to stick to the west of the kingdom after the defeat, it will not be so easy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg has never suffered a major defeat since his debut. Even if you suffer a small loss in the early stage, you can make up for it later, thanks to this caution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the situation this time, which is obviously different from the past. Abandoning Warhammer Great Plains, beyond the bottom line of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you know that this is the choice with the highest winning rate, everyone has reasons to refuse it. The loss of the kingdom is second. The key is that everyone's family business is in the Great Plains of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the plain falls, even if it is only for a short period of time, everyone will have to pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is to make sacrifices now and become a rootless duck. When dividing up the spoils after the war, they also don't have enough confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, the plan to retreat to the west of the kingdom has been temporarily put on hold, and the situation has not yet reached that point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, let's think about how to stop the orc army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to your previous deployment, this kind of plan to resist and slow down the pace of the orc army is obviously out of date now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom needs to adopt more active strategies and tactics, rather than blindly retreating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hasn't the Terran Alliance declared war? When will reinforcements from various countries arrive? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II decisively vetoed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like many great nobles, the royal family has its roots in the Warhammer Plains. Although the western region also has royal territories, their proportion is less than one-fifth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give up the foundation and move the capital to the west, and the royal family's advantage over the domestic nobles will no longer exist. Maybe the final say is not as good as the great nobles in the western region.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the lost ground can be regained after the war, it will be a major political reshuffle. The western aristocrats who have taken advantage will definitely take the opportunity to expand their strength eastward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the core interests of the royal family, so naturally there is no possibility of compromise. Even though he knew that a decisive battle with the orcs would be risky, Joseph II still had no choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not jump out directly, accusing Marshal Borg of conspiracy in his plan, which was his last respect for the Marshal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the speed of action of the Human Race Alliance this time is a bit faster than expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The parliament has passed the first batch of military material aid plans, including 100 magic crystal cannons, 3,000 magic crossbows, 50,000 armors, 30,000 horses, 20 million pounds of rye...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Moxi people were the first to be assisted, and their family took 60% of the quota.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the remaining material quotas, the Alpha Kingdom monopolizes 30% of the quota, and the last 10% of the quota will belong to the Kingdom after being divided among the Ortons. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Cassidy said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these aid materials are not obtained for nothing, they will still need to pay the cost price in the future, but it is very rare to be able to obtain parity-priced strategic materials during wartime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is understandable that they can't win the Alpha Kingdom. The strengths of the two sides are there, and the right to speak in the alliance is not the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the Alpha Kingdom has held back most of the orc army and undertook the heaviest military pressure, so it is understandable to take an extra share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing to the Principality of Moxie, Cassidy was not convinced. The representatives of the Warhammer Kingdom protested as soon as the Terran Alliance meeting made a resolution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the protest was accepted by the parliament, but the final result remains unchanged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is: the Principality of Moxi needs more help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a lot of nonsense, and some representatives directly accused them of not doing anything during the war and not playing their due role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this issue, Cassidy can't help. The kingdom's strategic issues cannot be changed by a foreign minister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Will I be easy to bully when I am Warhammer Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do for food? Why does it tolerate the unfair treatment of the Kingdom? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the king's questioning, Cassidy secretly complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What to do or not to do? The material assistance plan was approved by the parliament immediately after it was proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want public relations, you have to have time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

All the nobles cherish their lives, and the guards around them are all cronies, and outsiders are not allowed to get close at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after seeing the introduction of the murderer's identity, Hudson accepted the reality instantly. People have idiosyncrasies, and these idiosyncrasies are their greatest weaknesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killers disguised as slaves and servants to lurk, obviously cannot be completed overnight, maybe some of them have been lurking for several generations, otherwise they would not be able to get close at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than lurking, Hudson prefers to believe that he is being controlled by evil methods. After all the humiliation and torture, just to assassinate him once, the price he paid was too high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally, some individuals, driven by hatred, may be able to do it. It's obviously not realistic for a group of killers to do that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, Hudson recalled the auction that went against business logic before the war. Two beautiful elf girls were sent to the southeastern province for auction by slave traders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other slaves cannot quickly approach nobles, but elf slaves are undoubtedly the exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Born with a unique temperament, elves and beautiful girls are simply the natural enemies of men. After buying this kind of treasure, it is obviously impossible to keep it still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beauty is the best weapon. Almost all nobles are proud of conquering elf beauties. As long as a little trick is used, it is easy to fascinate the master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the cultivation base is banned, once you gain trust, you can still play assassination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can have similar operations, as well as fox girl, cat girl, leopard girl, rabbit girl...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter someone who is playing with flowers, you can change the gender, and the same can be applied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Letting these people do it has a much higher success rate than sending experts to assassinate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the front-line noble generals known to have been assassinated, except for the Duke of Arondo who was attacked and killed by an orc master, of the remaining seven: six died at the hands of slaves, and one was poisoned by a servant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder Caesar III personally ordered: front-line generals are prohibited from bringing alien slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mass assassination resulted in more casualties of high-ranking generals than a general battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are more times, it is estimated that the orcs will not attack, and the frontline army will collapse by itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't need to think about it, Hudson knows that the kingdom's northern frontier has become a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the family died suddenly, and outsiders could not command the family's private army at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the dead nobles who commanded a provincial army. Not only did their own army fall into chaos, but the command system of the provincial army also had problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to let the deputy come on the bench, but if you want to clear the command, it will not be done in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs can't seize this kind of opportunity that comes to their door, then they don't need to hang out on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trouble is trouble, but Hudson believes that the kingdom can still bear this kind of small turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to lose a few lines of defense. The dense castles and fortresses in the northern provinces are enough for the orcs to have a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't pull out the nails along the way, even if the orc army tore through the line of defense, you won't dare to go deep alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Kingdom of Alpha is not the Principality of Moxi, and every noble family has a lot of gold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lone army goes deep, and once trapped in a tight siege, it will be difficult to get out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a kingdom with rich experience in beatings, even if the situation collapses, it will gradually deteriorate, rather than die all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the situation in the kingdom, Hudson is more worried about the mastermind behind the scenes. The official answer is the Orc Empire, but this statement is obviously not convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five royal families of the Orc Empire ruled together, and the power was directly divided into five. Except when they invaded the human race as a whole, the five imperial courts were independent in normal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many internal contradictions among the five families, and the intelligence network naturally acts alone. If you want to plan such a large-scale operation, you obviously think highly of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if it is really the handiwork of the orcs, why only target the Alpha Kingdom instead of bringing the Principality of Mosi and the Kingdom of Warhammer along with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson looked down on his allies. If a large number of major generals on the front line were killed, the Terrance defense line still in the hands of the Mosi people would immediately collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these troops, it is only a matter of time before the fall of Dapace, and the Principality of Moxi will be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Warhammer Kingdom is similar. Their \"steel defense line\" seems to be very powerful, but in fact they rely heavily on the cooperation of the frontline legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a problem in any link, the steel defense line will become a scrap iron defense line, and it will be broken through by the orc army in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a comprehensive analysis, it is clear that the black hand behind the scenes is more suspected of being the human race, and also has a deep hatred with the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, two words appeared in Hudson's mind - \"Holy See\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson's face darkened. If this guess is correct, then something big will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news is confirmed, civil strife in the human race is imminent. The monarchist faction headed by the Frankish Kingdom will definitely take the opportunity to liquidate the Holy See, so the front line...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson quickly dismissed this idea, Caesar III is not the master of whims. Even if the Holy See is found out, he will endure it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Civil war at this time will only make orcs cheaper. Even if the Holy See is to be liquidated, it will have to wait until after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson couldn't help but secretly scolded the Holy See for being stupid. Even if it is to add obstacles to the Alpha Kingdom, this method should not be adopted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to defeat a big country, it is very difficult to rely on external forces alone. The best way is to intensify internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson got more and more headaches, and the original plan could no longer be used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See will be stupid once, but it does not mean that they will always be stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The declining old aristocrats will not give up their benefits willingly, and the newly rising aristocrats will also not give up expansion. Collision between the two sides is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war, the Alpha Kingdom was reshuffled. A battle between dragons and tigers is inevitable, and this is the best time for the Holy See to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very easy to support some nobles secretly to do things, but to interfere clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting aside these troubles, Hudson held a banquet at Flying Bear Castle for the first time. In order not to be criticized, the banquet was given a nice name: Celebration Banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it has been a while since the last big victory, these are minor problems. The reasons are all ready-made, and the military affairs are busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you're done, let's celebrate. There is nothing wrong with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are naturally reasons for choosing this time point. On the one hand, it was necessary to win over the fallen Orton nobles, and on the other hand, it was for the northern nobles in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the children of the northern nobles, their proportion in the expeditionary army is very small, but in terms of ability, these people are among the best in the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, Hudson has no hope of subduing these guys, but the situation has changed now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden assassination case has triggered a major change on the front line, and many fiefdom nobles will definitely suffer in the northern Xinjiang area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big aristocrats are strong, and it is estimated that they can survive this storm, but the small and medium aristocrats are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are attached to the five Dukes of Northern Xinjiang, there is a high probability that they will be cannon fodder at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the power of the family is severely damaged, or even directly destroyed, then these children of the northern nobles will become rootless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention going a step further, whether the family can be passed on in the southeastern province is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the protection of the family, they have no right to speak in politics. There are grudges for revenge, grudges for grudges, and the local nobles have plenty of ways to play them to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, Master Hudson's kindness is very important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they were a bit more black-hearted, Hudson could kill them and directly annex their fief after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after all, there is fellowship, and Hudson doesn't even bother to do this kind of unscrupulous trick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you are willing to accept his kindness, then everyone is still a good friend. It doesn't matter if you don't want to hang out with Master Hudson, you just apply to leave the southeastern province after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also for the good of everyone. The local nobles in the southeast province can't tolerate them. Without the protection of the background, it would be difficult to get along.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after these guys entered the army, they continued to make friends, but in the face of interests, this relationship is still not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, why do you look worried? Could it be that I didn't entertain you well?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked pretending not to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has always been very concerned about this old neighbor. Although Baron Kettley has been suppressed by him, this does not affect his own ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an unfavorable environment, the continuous growth of the Maple Leaf collar is the best proof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current panic is naturally covered by Keitelai's bad luck, and she is once again deeply trapped in the vortex of the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the official document forwarded by the Kingdom, the \"July Meeting\" was mentioned. Although there is no real evidence to prove it, there is a high probability that July will not be able to escape the charge of colluding with orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the July Society, even if you are forced to join, it will be difficult to escape the kingdom's liquidation afterwards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the family's strength is not damaged, maybe it can help him operate a little bit. But judging from the current situation, few of the small and medium-sized nobles in the northern Xinjiang area are likely to be able to retreat unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Earl misunderstood, I am just worried about the situation in the northern border. Many senior generals were assassinated and killed, and I am afraid that it will be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While explaining, he kept gesturing to Hudson, as if begging to let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson smiled slightly. He raised his glass, took a sip, and then turned around to deal with other nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people don't need to say a lot of things directly, just giving a hint is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The identity of the \"July Club\" is now Baron Kettley's biggest flaw. If you don't want to be smashed to pieces in the storm, you can only fall to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether this backing can provide shelter from wind and rain, it will take time to verify.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least for a short period of time, Hudson is relatively reliable in his impression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight pause, Baron Kettley also joined in the communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just different from the past, in the conversation with friends, I always inadvertently mention the advantages of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Became a lobbyist, Kettley was forced to do nothing. If you want to go to the past, you have to get some certificates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pulling a group of friends to seek refuge in the past is more important than being alone. If the situation changes in the future, the possibility of being an abandoned child will be even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Atreus province of the Warhammer Kingdom, a great battle to determine the fate of the kingdom is constantly kicking off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg, who was firmly opposed to this battle, finally chose to put down the pick. Whoever likes to go, anyway, Marshal Borg fell ill strategically because of his temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was nothing he could do about his wayward marshal. Joseph II could only supervise the battle himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, involving the coordination and coordination of armies in multiple provinces, and the prestige of ordinary generals was insufficient, so they couldn't coordinate at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The important generals of the kingdom were screened all over, but they couldn't find anyone more suitable than Marshal Borg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II, who was finally forced to the corner, had no choice but to take command himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is still willing to give the king face. The armies of the provinces basically completed the mobilization as required, and then problems arose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the distance, although the armies of each province set off at about the same time, their arrival times were also different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, Joseph II commanded an army of 550,000 this time, claiming to have an army of one million. In fact, the number of troops in place was less than 300,000, and the army of orcs killed them at the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to change the location of the decisive battle. If they retreated at this time, the orc army would chase after them, and it might turn into a big rout at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on, Mateus that idiot, why didn't he hold on for ten days?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joseph II asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, from the moment he took charge in person, he felt a little regretful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commanding the army himself, he realized that the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops is really beyond the reach of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though many experienced generals were transferred to assist, there were still problems in the specific implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although nobles from all over the world followed suit to train serf soldiers since the outbreak of the Great War, military training also requires talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private army of the big nobles can barely be seen, but the private army of the small and medium nobles below is hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Training is indeed training for a period of time, but judging from the results, it is only slightly better than no training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles with no experience in military training directly applied the method of training family guards. In the end, the elite soldiers were not trained, but there were not a few serfs who were disabled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the order to mobilize, armies from all over the place continued to gather together, and it became a large gathering of mobs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are some elite legions, if they are placed in the ranks of the general mob, they can only do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these trained legions are still stronger than the pure recruits of the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the nobles have taught the simple battle on the battlefield. It will not appear on the battlefield, holding a weapon and not knowing what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, Count Mateus has died in battle, and the frontline army responsible for intercepting is almost wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of orcs was approaching menacingly. They seemed to have made up their minds to kill them all the way, ignoring the back road at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plan we envisioned has not been able to play its due role. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thiago replied bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Military Affairs, he has been a bellows in recent days, receiving air from both ends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king blamed the Ministry of Military Affairs for its ineffectiveness, and the generals below blamed the Ministry of Military Affairs for their blind command, ignoring everyone's actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is like this, the troops below all have their own difficulties, but the situation on the front line does not allow them to solve the difficulties slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The front line is responsible for blocking the enemy, and the army that buys time to decide the war collapses. Count Matthaeus, the coach, was killed in battle, and it is really unreasonable to spray them for not working hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the highest-level general killed in the Warhammer Kingdom since the war started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But happiness is all about comparison. The Principality of Moxi and the Kingdom of Alpha who fought against the orcs together, and the high-ranking generals who died in the battle were much more than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Principality of Orton, which was brought along, had more high-level generals killed in battle than the Kingdom of Warhammer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, Joseph II forcibly suppressed the anger in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is dead, there is no point in holding on to a dead person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core issue now is not whether Count Mateus is incompetent, but how to deal with the next changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to retreat, so you can only bite the bullet. With an army of nearly 300,000, even if they couldn't defeat the orc army, they wouldn't be able to defeat it for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the war is dragged on, as reinforcements from all over the world continue to arrive, the situation will slowly be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking about all this, Joseph II calmed down a little, and immediately ordered: \"Send the order, the whole army is ready for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, the whole army will guard the camp, and no one is allowed to attack without my order. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at each other across the river, Duke Daniel, who was looking at the human army on the opposite side, smiled coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the magical world, a small river less than 30 meters wide naturally cannot stop the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not necessary to build a pontoon bridge, just a magic pass can cut off the river.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what kind of disaster this will bring downstream, it doesn't matter to the orc army bent on destroying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on victories all the way, coupled with successive beatings, Daniel's control over the coalition forces has once again reached a new level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't say a word, at least no one dares to roar at him. Everyone knew that the prince of the Yinyue wolf clan would really kill people if he got angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke, according to the information we have collected, the enemy's army has not yet fully assembled. Now is the best time for us to attack. You order to attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Battelle proposed enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head coach of the Eagle Legion, he has nothing to do with the decisive battle on the ground, and he is basically a spectator in the battle ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only performance was the siege of Orton's capital. Unfortunately, they were desperate, and throwing a few stones didn't have much effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's rare to find a fighter plane, so I naturally want to show off to prove that they are not here for an outing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not yet!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps his words were too profound for Marquis Battelle to understand, so Daniel added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, don't forget, our goal this time is to take down the entire Warhammer Kingdom, not just defeat them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of looking for the enemy all over the world to fight a decisive battle, it is better to wait for them to gather the army and destroy their morale at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we act now, the defeated enemy can still retreat to the western mountainous area. If you want to destroy the Warhammer Kingdom again, you can only drill the mountain ditch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Empire is certainly not afraid of fighting against the Terrans in the mountains, but as the defensive side, the Terrans can make the most of the terrain advantages, which will consume a lot of our time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Terran Alliance has already intervened, and reinforcements from all nations of the Terran may arrive at any time. We have no extra time to waste on the Warhammer Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Duke Daniel also glanced at the farther Alpha Kingdom. Winning the Kingdom of Warhammer is just a starting point. The real purpose of this war is to destroy the old rival Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only by first defeating the three big countries in the north of the human race, will the orc empire be able to take advantage of the situation and seize the entire northern continent in the troubled times that follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the current war, it is nothing more than a warm-up before the advent of troubled times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not enough to pull the human race from the position of the overlord of the mainland. At least until all the races in the mainland join the war, there is no hope at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can only be said that the Warhammer Kingdom is strong enough to dare to play a big battle at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to play a big game, you might as well join forces with the Mosi people and take back the Augustsburg defense line first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this gap is closed, it will only be a matter of time before the orc army that entered the Warhammer Kingdom is destroyed, and it is impossible to break through and leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting against the Great Plains of Warhammer in Yimapingchuan, even if you can defeat the orc army, you can't annihilate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't fight, can you still run away?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the Orc Expeditionary Army were cavalry, and infantry chasing cavalry was a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doubts are doubts, Hudson still did not express his position. Things like war have always been full of infinite possibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although from the analysis of known data, the victory of the Warhammer Kingdom this time is not high, but there are exceptions to everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case there are more than a dozen or twenty elite legions among the army assembled by the Warhammer Kingdom, plus a group of younger brothers playing human sea tactics, it is feasible to exhaust the orc expeditionary army with numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is only a small probability event after all. Most of the main armies of the Warhammer Kingdom were restrained at the front line. If there were so many main armies in the rear, they would not be at the bottom of the top ten kingdoms of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's no wonder the Mosi people are nervous. As old neighbors and neighbors with relatively close strengths, the two countries have had many frictions in the past years, and the strengths of each other are too familiar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things that you can't handle at home, can you be able to handle it with such a flimsy Warhammer Kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't answer this question. In military affairs, it is often the slightest difference that determines victory or defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, are you ready for a big war so soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mosi people want to break the siege of Dapes, and he has no objection, provided that the Mosi people can hold back the Beamon army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a long time, the Beamon Legion, which had lost a lot of losses, has been replenished. Even if the combat power has not recovered to its peak period, it will still have nine points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a full-stacked Beamon cavalry regiment, no matter who meets them head-on, they will feel their scalps go numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not without force that can confront them head-on. A knight group composed of pure practitioners can compete with the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the number of knights is really too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with tens of thousands of expeditionary troops, Hudson never thought of forming a knight order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they can't be formed, the main reason is to forcefully form a knight order, and the core strength of other legions will be drained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who own the knight order are not necessarily the most powerful in military strength, but they must be the wealthiest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purely from the perspective of cost performance, the cost of a thousand knights is more than that of an ordinary 10,000 army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the same funds are used to form a cavalry regiment, at least three or four thousand cavalry regiments can come out. If the selection requirements are raised further, the final cost will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Troops with such a large expenditure are still flocked to by everyone, and naturally they also have their unique charm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Super combat effectiveness, high mobility, long-distance raiding ability... are the advantages of the Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first principality on the mainland, the Mosi people naturally have their own knights. It is a pity that many knights suffered heavy losses in the battle for Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the official statement, and the details are kept strictly confidential by the various nobles. Hudson didn't know whether he was really hit hard or was preserving his strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are also strong and weak points between the Knights and the Knights. Some knight orders are composed of pure knights, and some knight orders are also mixed with warriors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside occupations, a knight group composed of junior knights is definitely not as good as a knight group composed of intermediate knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gap in combat power may even be several times as large, and it cannot be generalized at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know the strength of the Mosi knights, but he has personally experienced the combat effectiveness of the Beamon cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the elites were concentrated to encircle and annihilate a tired Beamon cavalry regiment that was not full of strength, they all paid a lot of losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is too embarrassing for him to face a full Beamon cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the expeditionary army can block the charge of the Beamon cavalry by setting up a large formation, but there is no possibility of defeating the Beamon cavalry, or even delaying it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the first batch of supplies aided by the Human Alliance is already on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has coordinated with several neighboring countries. They will first borrow some of our strategic materials, and then repay them with the follow-up materials delivered by the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, these materials have entered our country, but for the sake of safety, they are currently transported in small batches and multiple times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the friendship between our two countries, the Expeditionary Force will be one of the troops that will be replenished in the first round.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the battle damage of the expeditionary force, we can provide a recruit army as a supplement. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't take Hodge's words to heart. \"Friendship\" and not \"friendship\" are pure nonsense. If it weren't for the great achievements of the expeditionary army, it would be impossible to have this treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dukedom of Orton and the Earl of Ruilin, which also sent expeditionary forces, were destroyed when the expeditionary force was destroyed. Even if there are still residual forces, the Moxi people have not seen them helping them restore the system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, it is because of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom Expeditionary Force led by Hudson is capable of fighting and has great strategic significance for the Principality of Moxi. Even if it is not their own army, it is treated equally for the sake of national security.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dukedom of Orton and the Expeditionary Force of the Earl of Ruilin, who have no combat effectiveness, have no real meaning to the Mosi people, and the national power behind them is not strong enough, so they are naturally ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At most, I can appreciate a few words on diplomatic occasions, but deep down I can't tell how to despise the incompetence of the two families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, if you can get the assistance of the alliance, then the chances of winning this operation will increase by three points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know how many elite troops your country can invest this time besides the defenders of Dapes? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The icing really satisfies him, but he has to check first whether there are cannonballs wrapped inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in caring about the ordinary army. As long as the Moxi people are willing, they can easily pull out hundreds of thousands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of army is purely majestic, even against the orc cannon fodder army. Although the lower limit of the orcs is low, as long as they have that bloodthirsty animal nature, they cannot be compared with ordinary serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, the combat effectiveness of an ordinary orc army is about equal to that of a newly formed army trained by the Mosi for more than half a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends on the race. Some powerful races can even surpass some elite legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the five royal families, other powerful races in the Orc Empire have been greatly weakened. Either the genocide has already been exterminated, or it is on the verge of genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, it is not only the rise of the human race that leads to the decline of the orc hegemony, but the internal struggle of the orcs is the core factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the five royal families of the orcs don't suppress the development of the powerful races below, maybe they can pull out elite troops now, and they can directly add a zero behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth is that, but when it comes to their own interests, not everyone can let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to protect the dominant position of the ruling group and suppress the rise of other races, this is just an instinct.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Three super-organized elite infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments, plus five knight regiments, and 15 new regiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the expeditionary force and the defenders in the city, we have enough advantages. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hodge said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this data, Hudson's face improved a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terence was able to organize so many troops when Terrence was restrained by a large number of troops. The family property of the Principality of Moxi was a bit stronger than he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What he didn't know was that these forces were the last force that the Mossi people resisted after they moved their capital after the fall of Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sudden change in the situation gave the Moxi people hope, so they changed their original plan and planned to lift the siege of Dapace first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After contemplating for a moment, Hudson said slowly: \"Your Excellency, Marshal, if your country can gather so many elites, it will not be difficult to break the siege of Dapes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem now is that the behavior of the orcs is very abnormal. Knowing that the main force besieging Da Pest City is insufficient, they did not send reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's as if they're playing a big game of chess, just waiting to get us hooked, and the army besieging Dapace is the bait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not very clear about the situation on the front line, but the bear court on the opposite side has indeed increased its troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two bear infantry regiments, plus a mysterious elephant cavalry. It's not an ordinary war elephant, but an elephant with the blood of a monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific combat power is unknown. If there is half of the combat power of the legendary golem army, our cavalry can only take a detour!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Orc ordinary legions will increase in number even more. We haven't figured out the specific number and strength, but at least it starts with 100,000 troops. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Xiongren Royal Court increased its troops on a large scale, and it was all caused by him. Xiong Renhuang, who suffered a big loss, has become a frightened bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A main army could no longer give him a sense of security, so he simply mobilized a large number of troops from the rear, directly eliminating the possibility of another attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson doesn't have the courage to attack the bear court again now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many troops coming, it must not be just to defend the home. It is entirely possible to take revenge on Flying Bear Castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in taking action is mainly a strategic issue. The Fort of Flying Bear cannot be taken down in a day or two, even a hundred and eighty thousand beast lives cannot fill this huge hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The material reserves in the city. Recently, Hudson also took advantage of the peace vacuum created by him to obtain several material supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to break through the city by siege, you must be prepared for a protracted war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bears don't have that much time to spend here, even if they are willing to die here, the other four royal families will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way to take revenge is not to storm the city, but to draw the expeditionary army out of the city for a decisive battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a face-to-face confrontation, a Ursaen infantry regiment expeditionary force can still handle it; two Ursaen infantry regiments rely on tactics to deal with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are more, Hudson can only run away with the infantry. Even if half of the domestic recruits are already in place, the first few tens of thousands are still capable of fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can rest assured, we have already found out clearly. The orcs assembled a large army on the front line, mainly to invade the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Warhammer has assembled a heavy army, preparing for a decisive battle with the Orc Expeditionary Army in the province of Atrus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this critical moment, the Orc Empire must gather heavy troops to launch a new round of offensive on the front line in order to contain the front line troops of the Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, the principality is no longer the focus of their attack. Perhaps at this time, the bear royal court has already begun to move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the orcs complete the mobilization of troops, we will take immediate action. Even if they want to turn around, the transfer of the army cannot be completed in a day or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we are fast enough, we can break the siege of Dapes before the orc reinforcements arrive. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Marshal Hodge's confident look, Hudson stopped thinking about continuing to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be done or not, we still have to fight a battle to know. Everyone has prepared so well, it would be too shameless to pour cold water at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, as long as your country's army can contain the main army of the orcs and stop the reinforcements sent by the orcs, the rest will be left to the expeditionary army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, regarding the issue of war horses and weapons and equipment, we still need to send someone to urge them. If the installation is completed one day earlier, our chances of winning will be one point higher. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sincerity of the tone did not give Marshal Hodge the slightest chance to refuse. Several times he wanted to speak, but finally he swallowed it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a guest army, and it is okay to ask others to help, but it is too embarrassing to expect others to be the main force to take over the most tiring work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that even if Hudson is willing to agree, the expeditionary force has no way to contain the Beamon Cavalry Legion of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to say what is destined to be impossible. Only the cavalry can really bring restraint to the Beamon Cavalry Corps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two cavalry regiments + five knight regiments, the strength on paper is already very close to that of the Beamon cavalry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If some cavalry are drawn from various troops to join the battle, maybe another cavalry regiment can be assembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength gap between the two sides is not big, just to contain one or two, the possibility of failure is very small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real trouble is to intercept reinforcements. If you can't stop the reinforcements from the orcs, no matter how well you fight ahead, it won't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five imperial families of the orcs send an elite army in, and the situation will be reversed again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can rest assured that once the horses and weapons are in place, they will be equipped for the expeditionary army as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the deployment of the war, it is still too early to talk about these. After the situation becomes clearer, we will communicate and discuss slowly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he lacked confidence, and Marshal Hodge did not dare to give an affirmative answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strategic focus of the orcs has shifted. That is just their inference based on changes in the battlefield situation, and it does not mean that it will definitely happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case someone feigns a shot and continues to catch them and beat them hard, it is not impossible to make up their minds to destroy the Principality of Moxi first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After sending away Marshal Hodge, Hudson's focus returned to military training. Compared with the past, there have been quite a few changes in recent days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has not received the clear allegiance of his subordinates, more and more nobles are showing favor to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Temporarily unable to receive subordinates, but also can be friends. The grown-up world is real, and it comes down to a deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What can be obtained and what needs to be paid.\" will be the core factor that determines everyone's choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is doomed not to be anxious. If you are too eager, you will expose your needs in advance, and you will put yourself in a passive position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the nobles are ambitious, and they will not sell themselves to seek refuge unless they have to. The best way to compare with these people is not to subdue them, but to serve as political allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the relationship is handled well, when the flag is raised in the future to recruit people, someone will naturally send their children over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these nobles with titles and fiefs, those noble children who have nothing are the ones Hudson can really \"afford to buy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, this is the new plan for the expeditionary force, please have a look!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Baron Kettley handed an official document to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also one of Hudson's recent achievements. Although there were no drastic reforms to the expeditionary force, he still created a small staff internally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original military system has not been changed, and the newly released small staff department is limited to staff and assists in handling military affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It did not affect the leadership of noble officers over their own private army, did not violate the actual interests of everyone, and naturally did not cause waves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the current adjustment of the army establishment, it still follows the tradition of the Alpha Kingdom and expands step by step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the list of officers and the configuration of troops above, Hudson nodded slightly as his colleagues had communicated with them first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just follow the above list and release it to the public!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
