All the big shots in the academy were nowhere to be seen, and only ordinary lecturers were left.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     Knowing that these guys were deliberately avoiding him and not wanting to get angry with a small fry, Hudson headed straight for the palace with a rage in his heart.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     You can hide for a while, but you can't hide forever. Hudson didn't believe that there was no shadow of the royal family in such a big news.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     No matter how independent the Arcane Academy is, its students and instructors are all inextricably linked to the kingdom and cannot be free from its constraints.\n    </font>\n   </font>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     In normal times, when the arcanists cause trouble, they always speak under their personal aliases.
