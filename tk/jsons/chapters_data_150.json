Kayo, who has been rooted in magic for many years, has long been accustomed to dealing with all kinds of strange materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was treated on the road, the lizard beast's body still partially rotted. The monster, which was already exuding a stench, now smells even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I persisted for a while, but in the end I still couldn't stand it. After leaving the work of disposing of the corpse to his assistant, Baron Kayo silently exited the backyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these assistants are just magic apprentices, in fact their professional quality is not low at all, and their handling of magic materials is even more sophisticated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all carefully selected and cultivated by the Dalton family. Everyone's magical talent is not low. The main reason for not being able to become a magician is-the background is too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although magicians are powerful, their cultivation depends on resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also cultivation, some people hold magic spar in one hand, and potions to assist cultivation in the other; some people can only practice hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the only way, then slowly working hard will eventually have a direction. It is a pity that all magical knowledge is not imparted for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every magic spell, every magic lesson, every consultation with the instructor...all are clearly marked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention ordinary people, many little nobles dare not touch magic, the gold-swallowing behemoth. Just like the Hudson brothers, they haven't even passed the magic talent test.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not testing is the best choice. If you really have a good magic talent, it will be an annoyance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Redman could afford the initial expenses, but with the passage of time, more and more funds needed to be invested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is only one son, it is okay to spend a lot of money to cultivate it. But I can't stand having too many brothers and sisters, so I can't give up other children just to raise a son, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats who are addicted to studying magic and finally bankrupted themselves appear almost every year in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the talent is good and you become a strong man like a magister, then all the initial investment can be recovered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if the talent is not enough, and you can't even become a great magician in the end, then it is purely a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo is undoubtedly a failed magician. Maybe if you continue to spend resources, you can become a great magician one day, but for the Dalton family, it doesn't have any real meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you unlock other talents while becoming a magician, for example: good at alchemist, good at drawing magic circles, good at magic potions...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is embarrassing is that these occupations also need to spend resources in the early stage. Except for a few geniuses, most of them have to experience countless failures before they can see benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too much investment is also an important reason for the scarcity of these occupations. If it weren't for these guys, an occasional achievement could shock the mainland, and countries would not spend a lot of money to support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These subsidies have nothing to do with Baron Cayo, he wants to get subsidies from the kingdom. At least one of the following conditions must be met: the strength of the great magician, or a valuable research result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former joined the Kingdom Magician Group, while the latter stayed in the Magic Association and continued to study the truth of magic, the mysteries of alchemy, and the birth of gods...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of weird subjects, and they were once the favorite of Baron Cayo. Unfortunately, those old guys have no eyes, and none of them took a fancy to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is the origin of the Dalton family. Let everyone dare not abuse him as a cheap labor income. If nothing is achieved after ten or twenty years, it will be an enmity with the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magicians are also human beings, who also have emotions and desires. There is a big family behind him who needs to be taken care of, and he cannot get rid of the sophistication of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After cleaning off the stench from his body, and coming out with a change of clothes, Baron Kayo opened the secret letter and said with a smile: \"In recent days, the number of weapons orders from the Mountain Territory has suddenly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Really interesting!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that Hudson's pile of junk could only be used to fool some ignorant country nobles, but I didn't expect it to become a sought-after item now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the buyers are not local nobles. It seems that the inside story behind this should be a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forber, let the family pay attention to these buyers. With so many weapons purchased, there must be a place to go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, arrange someone to sell the magic materials in the backyard to make up for the financial hole in the territory. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, master.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler replied with a full smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is very satisfied with Baron Cayo's transformation. If so many magic materials were harvested in the past, there is a high probability that they will be directly cursed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is undoubtedly a major transformation to be able to choose to resell the magic materials because of the economic problems of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, the old housekeeper added: \"Master, our layout in Wyton County is almost completed, and we should consider how to collect the net next.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is about the dispute between the sheriff and the governor, and there is no room for relaxation. If it's just Baron Cayo himself, then it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses, but now he represents the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In one's own sphere of influence, it is very embarrassing to fail to compete with others for the position of sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The layout is still too hasty, if it takes longer, it won't be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I failed to pull those guys into the net this time, and I want to design them later, it will not be so simple! In the future, there may be troubles in Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at this time, I don't care so much. The position of sheriff must be finalized as soon as possible, so as not to have long nights and dreams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how unlucky they are, they are better than those two in Wright County. A pattern of confrontation between the two powers has formed. Even if the kingdom appoints a sheriff, the other side will not let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have their own advantages, and for a long time to come, no one will be able to do anything to the other. It seems that in the days to come, we will not be lonely. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happiness is based on comparisons. It is nothing more than his own difficulty in completely controlling Wyton County, but the good neighbor next door is directly split into two camps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local aristocrats are deeply rooted, and there are many relatives and friends nearby, occupying an absolute upper hand in public opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang aristocrats have strong military strength, a strong background behind them, and a higher right to speak politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two groups like this confront each other, and it is not a matter of overnight if they want to win or lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, Baron Sith has not been in a good mood since Hudson called a group of younger brothers to form an alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy who thought he could deal with it with a wave of his hand has now grown into a serious problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time to solve the problem by force has passed away forever. Just looking at the strength on paper, the 700 or so soldiers in his hands are no match for the two infantry regiments in the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Baron Sith has a hundred cavalry, there is still a terrifying sharpshooter on the opposite side!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beyond three hundred steps, you can shoot without fail, and you can also play five arrows flying together, which is simply unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a real battle, Baron Sith's biggest worry is not that the opponent's shots are too accurate, but that the opponent's eyesight is not good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a long distance, if he aimed at the wrong target, he might be taken away with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the sharpshooter is the nightmare of ordinary knights. In the face of this perversion, knights and ordinary soldiers enjoy the same treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't win a single duel, and the probability of winning a group fight is not high. Although there are not many troops that can fight in the hands of the local nobles, there are many serf soldiers who cannot stand up to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too many ants may not necessarily kill the elephant, but if there are too many serf soldiers, it will certainly be able to achieve success. Stabbing with a spear of six or seven meters, even if it is random, will gain something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a war where both sides suffer, any rational aristocrat would think twice before acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation has developed to this point, Baron Sith doesn't think he can respond to everything. At the very least, Baron Kelette, who he hated the most, has a high probability of not being able to command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is all caused by interests, and the Maple Leaf collar happens to be at the gate of the mountain collar. No matter how to talk about the interests of the team, people must first ensure their own safety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like the local nobles near Dardir City, they also dare not join Hudson's team. It is all determined by geopolitics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send someone to ask, what are those guys doing, why did they place an order with Shandi?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many weapon merchants in the Alpha Kingdom, where can they buy them? Knowing that Hudson and I were at odds, I ran to the mountains to buy it, it was clearly...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith cursed violently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a noble from another area, although he is not happy about placing an order with the leader of the mountain, he will not say much. How to choose products is the freedom of others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is different, although after the order was split, multiple sets of vests were used to place the order, but the strong northern Xinjiang accent quickly attracted the attention of interested people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may take a little effort for others to find out the origins of these guys, but Baron Sith, who also came from northern Xinjiang, quickly locked their identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of slave traders dared to come to make trouble for him. Do you really think that he, the illegitimate son of the Grand Duke, is easy to bully?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was in northern Xinjiang, his Sith was also a bully among the second generation children, and he dared to beat anyone when he got angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although because of his embarrassing status, he still couldn't integrate into the top circle, he was also a bully in the second-rate circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Young master, it is not appropriate to make extravagant incidents at this moment. The energy of those slave traders is not small, and we have left the Northland again, and we have long been beyond our reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't bother the master to intervene in person just because of such a trivial matter, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun hurriedly persuaded him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no uniform standard for the status of an illegitimate child, it all depends on the attitude of the father. Grand Duke Kavadia attaches great importance to it, so naturally no one dares to underestimate Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This moment, that moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he was in the north, Sith could sue his father at any time. Due to the power of Grand Duke Kavadia, these slave traders naturally did not dare to offend the second generation of Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the mountains are high and the roads are far away, it is not easy to sue. Especially when the distance is long, under the erosion of the years, the bond between father and son will inevitably fade day by day. Naturally, Baron Sith dare not waste easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's keep this account for them first. So many weapons and equipment have flowed into northern Xinjiang, so it's impossible for them to use them all for themselves, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the junk that Hudson produces, the orcs might be interested. Maybe these guys want to smuggle weapons to the orc empire in order to make huge profits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrange someone to reveal the matter to me, let the kingdom inspect the gang of smugglers, go find their bad luck! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There has long been a tacit understanding among the nobles in the northern border. No matter what happened, no one should provide any help to the kingdom's inspectors and smugglers, let alone tip off the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was the past, Baron Sith would use his energy to retaliate at most, but he would never find the responsible inspector.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is different now, since he left the Northland, he is no longer a nobleman of the Northland. The original rules of the game naturally do not apply now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain leader, Hudson, who has made a lot of blood, is waiting at the gate with a smile on his face. Naturally, only Baron Redman can have this card.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing a group of more than 20 people galloping on horseback, Hudson was also taken aback. Most of them were teenagers, including his two cheap brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that made him feel at ease was that there was no annoying guy like Lesul in it. It seems that Baron Redman didn't want to make things difficult for him, and he didn't bring that eye-catching guy over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, this is?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the clothes and decorations that these people are the children of nobles. Although the mountain leader lacks talents, it doesn't mean that he has to help others take care of their children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially these guys, most of them are not even knights, so they are completely useless in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to give these people a future, and it is simply unrealistic to recruit them. It's okay to draw big cakes to fool the serfs, but if you want to fool the noble children, you don't have to dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can fool the young ones, can you still fool the old ones? It can't be that the whole family is all fools, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't want to spend a lot of money, he worked hard to train people, and finally ran to other nobles one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These boys are all descendants of other branches of the family, settle them down first, and I will explain to you separately later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These other people escorted them over. They are all your distant uncles, Knight Sean, Knight Poll, Knight Feder...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman introduced calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of relatives increased, and Hudson sent a smiling face in his signature style. A thriving population is not necessarily a good thing. Just remembering everyone will take a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Housekeeper, take these little guys to the guest room to rest. Father, uncles, this is not a place to talk, let's chat in the hall!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson led the way directly, and led everyone into the slightly shabby living room to sit down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you should know the rules of my Koslow family. Except for the eldest son who inherits the family business, the other children must fend for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the kingdom is generally peaceful, various accidents are still inevitable. Except for Ni's two younger brothers, the rest of them are descendants of family members who went abroad after accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all children are able to leave a legacy for the younger generation, and most of the children who go out to make a living can only barely make ends meet in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they die halfway, the life of their children will become a problem. According to the family practice, the growth expenses of the descendants of these families are shared by the various branches of the industry according to their respective economic conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was okay when I was young, but as I grew older, when it was time to awaken the seeds of life, problems arose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has a thriving population, and there are many children from each branch. Just solving the cultivation resources of these children is a headache for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is even more difficult to take care of all the children of the clan. Therefore, in every generation of ours, there are many family members who have lost the opportunity to become knights due to the lack of life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, there was no way. The Kingdom has very strict control over the original liquid of life, and it is difficult to buy it even with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is different. Many families in the two counties have declined, and many down-and-out nobles have reached the point where it is difficult to maintain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain the expenses of the territory, some people will also sell the quota for exchanging life liquid in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it's a cash transaction, or the family providing them with security for a few years, it's negotiable…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Baron Redman's explanation, Hudson gradually understood. It was only because he had enough appeal among the local nobles to find him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that at the beginning, everyone just wanted to spend money to buy some life essence. However, the rise of the mountain land was too fast, and Hudson suddenly became the spokesperson for the interests of the local nobles in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As his strength became stronger, his speech naturally became tougher. Providing security protection for a certain period of time has also become an optional condition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a member of the Koslow family, having enjoyed the benefits brought by the family, naturally needs to bear the corresponding responsibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, I'm afraid this matter can't be done like this! Now that we propose to exchange life essence, many down-and-out nobles will agree, but we can't take off the hat of taking advantage of the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to find a way to make a detour from the side. You don't have to worry about how to operate it, I will arrange people to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just hard to say how much life essence can be exchanged. After all, there are quite a few people staring at this thing now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only must pay attention to eating, but also get the life essence, Hudson is also very helpless. It's just that the responsibility fell on him, and there is absolutely no reason to shirk it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to letting the elders of the family toss around, Hudson feels that it is safer to manage the business by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do your best, these are only the children of the family living in the southeast province. There are probably no less than a hundred people in the kingdom who need the life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply impossible to get them together. You don't have to have too much pressure, you can get as much as you can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing now is the battle between the county guards. If you can win the position of Sheriff of Wright County, it will be more strategic than adding a dozen knights to the family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he knows that Hudson is not something in the pool, according to his thinking, it will take more than ten or twenty years of accumulation to get to this point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in just a blink of an eye, he didn't understand what was going on, and the mountain leader became the king of Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The kingdom's control over the life essence has always been strict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the entire noble group, this kind of restriction is very necessary. If the number of knights is not controlled, the competition within the nobles will increase several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a group of guys with force can't find a job, the consequences can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each noble family has a limited quota of life essence, which is undoubtedly very unfavorable for a prosperous family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Koslow family as an example, if the resources are sufficient, the number of knights born in each generation may increase several times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is cruel. Except for those branch children who have foundations, who can obtain the life essence, most of the family children are forced to withdraw from the noble circle and become free people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking care of each other is limited to cultivating these people into adults. We really can't come up with more resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many freedmen in big cities are descendants of nobles. It's just that due to various reasons, it finally declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who came here this time should be close relatives. At least they have been given basic knight training, and some cultural knowledge has also been imparted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the relationship is farther away, then it is really just a meal. Not to mention knight training, even cultural knowledge is not taught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone is ruthless, but the more you know, the more troubles you will have.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the direct descendants can't take care of them, so who can take care of distant relatives?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few nobles with a thin population, the life essence overflowed. Most nobles would not sell this thing out, even if they can't use it up for themselves, relatives still have children in need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslows are relatives of this need. Baron Redman spends a lot of money every year and maintains personal relationships, and there is no shortage of reasons for this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To buy life essence, not only money is needed, but also favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most difficult thing for Hudson now is favors. As a spokesperson for the interests of the local nobles, he must pay attention to eating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is not to lose face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, write to Baron Kettley and ask him to come and talk.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the kingdom's decree, in addition to the quota of the nobles themselves, they can also be exchanged for military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's military exploits have become fiefdoms, so naturally there is no way to exchange them for life essence. But there is a group in the kingdom who has never lacked military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ancestors of the Koslow family came from northern Xinjiang, but unfortunately there were no connections left, but many enemies remained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the nobles in northern Xinjiang want to exchange for the life essence, they must first consider the reaction of the enemies of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is no response for so many years, and there is a high probability that the Koslow family has been forgotten by the Locknard family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the five giants in the Northland with enemies all over the kingdom, the Koslow family, which can't even maintain the dignity of a middle-class nobleman, is really hard for people to miss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big people don't have to worry about it, but little people can't help it. Goofing around in the Northland, after all, depends on the faces of the five giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has exceptions. Not daring to trade publicly does not mean that no one dares to trade secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even dared to smuggle large-scale ordnance, Hudson didn't think that the mysterious organization behind Kettley would be afraid of trading life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how daring the five giants of the Northland are, there is one thing they will definitely not do, and that is to smuggle arms to orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even they were the vanguards in combating the arms trade, prohibiting the nobles under their command to smuggle all iron products to the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with whether you are patriotic or not. It is purely that once the orcs invade, they will be the first to be beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Selling the rope to hang oneself is something that only capitalists can do. Veteran aristocrats are not so short-sighted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple leaf collar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ever since experiencing a wave of social beatings, Baron Kettley has become extremely sensitive, seeing everyone as a traitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The consequence of a serious lack of trust is that the small team is panicked. Except for Knight Holman, who was still able to say a few words, no one was trusted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. Before stepping on the pit, only Holman Cavaliers raised objections. During the implementation process, he did not forget to remind him to pay attention to controlling risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being tricked and forced to join the July Club cannot be said. He didn't even dare to investigate the traitor. Ketley could only hold back all the grievances in his stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, since you were brought back from the mountain last time, your mood is very wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The road of life is destined to be full of ups and downs. Only by learning to endure the momentary anger can we go further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you were wronged by those slave traders, you must endure it now. This is the price of doing something wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson posted a post for you just now, maybe you can go for a walk to relieve your mood. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holman tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanying his nephew to go south this time, apart from the subsidy from the family, the most important thing is that he is optimistic that Kettley can become a great weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan didn't change quickly. Kettley's ability is indeed not bad, but the opponents he faces are more and more perverted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, there was a competition within the nobles of the North. Kettler, who was not bad in all aspects, lost to Baron Sith, who had a good father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This one alone was instantly killed. Although Ketley tried to struggle a few times, nothing could be changed in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more unfortunate is that he became a neighbor with Hudson. Due to the poor location, Maple Leaf Leader had to look at the face of the neighbor next door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I see, Uncle Holman.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Past experience told him that it would be no good for Hudson to ask him out. If it was before, he would analyze it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, there is no need for that. If he doesn't get rid of the control of the July Society, he is destined to have no future in his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how well the general manages the territory, once the identity is revealed, it will inevitably be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Topple the current order and reshape the new world.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to fool around the sophomores. Anyone with a little experience knows that with the strength of the July Club, there is no hope at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the orcs invaded the south, at most they would be caught by surprise and destroy the five giants in northern Xinjiang. If you want to go further, you have to ask the nations of mankind whether they will agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a son of a northern Xinjiang nobleman, Kettler didn't want that to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no eggs under the whole nest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five giants in the Northland are unlucky, and the small and medium nobles who depend on them will only die faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He jumped out, but the family foundation is still in northern Xinjiang, and there is no time to transfer it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You want me to help you get out of July?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has only heard of the name of this organization, but he knows nothing about the specific situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the large and small chaotic party organizations in the kingdom, the July Society can be regarded as a clear stream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do not engage in cult sacrifices, do not disturb one party, and do not launch armed rebellion. Apart from the scary slogans, the biggest feature is mystery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Kettler hadn't said it himself, Hudson couldn't believe that the slave traders that day were all members of the July Society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What surprised Hudson the most was that the July Society not only had its own political platform, but also had clear rebellion goals, organizational systems, and even a blueprint for the future political system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether these things are reliable or not, this organizational structure alone surpasses countless rebel organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson wondered if some of his peers had traveled over, and his life was unsatisfactory, so he came up with such a mysterious organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's wrong to think about it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The July Society has chanted slogans for hundreds of years, but it has never been seen to be launched. Wouldn't that be dragging people into coffins?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"yes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley replied in the affirmative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wouldn't talk to Hudson about it if there were better options.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, when it comes to a mysterious organization like the July Society, even the closest people around him may betray him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the only exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson was also there that day, so he was half an insider. There is also a business relationship with the July Club, and it is difficult to explain clearly when the news gets out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead with his hand, Hudson didn't know whether to thank himself for being cautious enough, or scold himself for not being greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should have known earlier that the July Club was the one who bought the weapons, and he would never do anything about this deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, there was a wave of stability that day, and there was no greed for huge profits to eat alone. Otherwise, once this thunder explodes in the future, he will have to be smashed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the major arms dealers in the kingdom are all involved, which is actually a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The law does not blame the public. No matter how powerful the thunder explosion is, there are a large group of people who share the risk. There is a high probability that no one will continue to delve into this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, I just want to exchange for some life essence. Compared with helping you get rid of the July meeting, the risk is not at the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This business, even if you are not willing to do it, there will be other northern Xinjiang nobles doing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, why do you think I am capable of helping you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or do you think the July Society is so weak that a little baron like me can influence their decision-making? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in the Northland, if you come to the door to exchange the life essence, you will most likely be rejected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is the southeastern province, so as long as you are a little more careful, you can cover up the secret transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life essence is not marked, who knows where the Koslow family got it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Locknard family, if you have the time to watch every move of the Koslow family, it is better to send someone directly to destroy the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't do this, naturally there is something to consider. Even the great nobles have to abide by the order in the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the five giants in the Northland are just playing with borrowed swords to kill people, but they are not so arrogant that they personally lead people to destroy the whole family of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just killing people with a knife makes them notorious. If you do it yourself, you don't want to be in the circle of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spitting stars can kill people in many cases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you don't plan to recruit talents from the outside world, you don't need to marry other nobles, you don't need to form an alliance with other nobles, you don't need the help of the kingdom, you don't need the support of nobles from all over the world during the war...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, you must follow the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risk is controllable. As long as you are not an aristocrat attached to the Lochnard family, if the profit is high enough, you will definitely dare to do this business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is ready. If Kettley doesn't pick up, he will go find some other ambitious Northland nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to exchange political interests. They help the Koslow family obtain life essence, and the Koslow family brings them into the local aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of business where everyone gets what they need, there is no need to worry about no one to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having these guys come forward as middlemen is much better than the Koslow family looking for it themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, don't be angry. Since I dare to make such a request, there is naturally an equivalent exchange.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your Excellency just wants to exchange a small amount of life essence, there will naturally be people selling your face, so you can completely treat me as a fart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Koslow family is prosperous, not to mention a few life essences, I am afraid that dozens or hundreds of copies may not be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they belong to the same family, the current Koslow family is obviously more like an alliance of interests centered on blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The branches are not affiliated with each other, and no one can command anyone. Otherwise, if dozens of branches work together, your progress in the early stage will definitely be smoother than it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency still can't afford the price to buy those descendants who have foundations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to cultivate a family of knights, you can only dig out the marginalized children of the distant branch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the principle of equivalent exchange, a piece of life essence in exchange for ten years of service for them, this business will definitely not lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With your means, you will definitely be able to recover most of them within ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no action ahead, that is because the various branches have not made up their minds to bet on you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now within the Koslow family, your actions have been acquiesced, at least these branches in the southeastern province support it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The direct descendants may be reluctant to part with them, but those marginalized children who were not qualified to become knights are definitely recruited as much as you have the ability to recruit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Baron Kettley's explanation, Hudson was silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was his plan to gather the marginalized clansmen. Although engaging in a family entrepreneurial team is very unfavorable to the later development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But under the existing rule system, he can only play like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to cause trouble, even teaching some basic knowledge to officers in private is all trying to find excuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, the outside world has a lot of criticism. To disseminate knowledge on a large scale would be to cut oneself off from the aristocratic group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, there is no such trouble in cultivating one's own family. Regardless of the decline of the Yuanzhi people, how many generations of blood relationship have passed, they are all members of the Koslow family, and they are also of noble origin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he is a son of a nobleman, he is one of his own. The dissemination of knowledge is still within the aristocratic group and has not spread to the common people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No action has been taken, not because someone in the family objected. In fact, as long as Hudson can come up with enough resources, everyone doesn't mind sending all the children from the distant branch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without compromising one's own interests, it can also strengthen the family's strength. How could it be possible for all parties to oppose it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the lack of resources in Hudson's hands. The consumption of ordinary materials for daily learning and training can be barely borne, but there is really no way to cultivate resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life essence is just a stepping stone, and the cultivation after becoming a knight also requires auxiliary resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the extravagant resources, the magical potion used to heal the wear and tear of the body during the training process must be indispensable, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not enough to have money. In the case of a serious imbalance between supply and demand, if you want to buy enough auxiliary medicines, you also need personal connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the little nobles, these problems are not insurmountable. As long as the daily training time is reduced, the young age can definitely survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the age of 30 or 40, the body starts to go downhill. If you can't bear this pressure, you simply give up training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the reason why there are very few high-level knights among the minor nobles. It's not that everyone's talent is not good, it's just that the family can't afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the development of the family must be considered comprehensively, and individuals cannot be patronized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, you've said so much, but it's all nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really need a lot of life essence, even if you can solve this problem, it doesn't mean that I can help you get rid of the July meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know nothing about this mysterious organization. I guess you don't know much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just from a few words and rumors on the bright side, we can boldly deduce that there are other forces behind the organization that are secretly controlling it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the slogan of the July Club was not too shocking, they would even be able to come to the stage in a fair manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a well-regulated organization, it is really difficult for me to compare them with other cult organizations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once anything goes too far, there must be an inside story. With your ingenuity, it is estimated that you can guess a few points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they are all trapped, don't think about getting out so easily. Unless you can get the kingdom's top nobles to come forward and endorse for you!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't do this, then live in peace and contentment, as if nothing happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the name of the July Society has been resounding in the kingdom for more than a hundred years, and very few members have revealed their identities. As long as you are not too unlucky, it is not so easy for you to run into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have said all I can say, now we can talk about the transaction between us. What can you do to help me get enough life essence? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the dignified look, it can be seen that he is deeply afraid of the July Meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the results of Hudson's analysis so amazing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even he himself found it unbelievable. But reason told him that many unbelievable analyzes were often close to the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The content involved is too sensitive, and Hudson dared not draw conclusions until he could not be completely sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, he simply made it ambiguous and let Baron Kettley guess for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The matter of the July meeting ends here today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You need too much life essence, no matter which channel you exchange it from, it will be difficult to meet your needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To solve this problem, the best way is to make your own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the kingdoms on the surface, only the royal family has mastered the secret method of making life essence, but in fact, all the nobles are not short of life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even some powerful mid-level nobles seldom heard of the shortage of life essence. Every time people who need to buy life essence, it happens to be the minor nobles, and occasionally the mid-level nobles can be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson also understands, why is this?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Kettley's words, Hudson couldn't help but rolled his eyes. He is not a fool, so he naturally knows the reason behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the production process of the raw liquid of life is really only in the hands of the royal family as recorded in the history books, other big powers will not be able to rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The production process, although it is not a bad street, but the great nobles who do not lack knights have definitely realized the freedom of life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you have a formula for making life essence?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is almost impossible to obtain this kind of strategic resource, which is strictly blocked by the big forces, through formal channels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he can get it, he will never let it go. In a hurry, I took the bear out to fight Sap in the middle of the night, and I wanted to grab the things.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Dacheng alchemists will really make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Create some magic potions at will, and you can sell them for a lot of money. It is much more popular than the priest's kryptonite healing magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, isn't it just to tell me this? To tell you the truth, I am really not good at alchemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it does not mean that the Koslow family cannot invite a master alchemist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is a formula, we can research it even without the cooperation of refining techniques.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency should know what the life essence means to our family! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no discount, if there is such a thing, it is not his business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many branches of the Koslow family. If everyone acts together and shares the cost together, there are definitely a lot of resources that can be mobilized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since that's the case, then I'll just say it straight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A year ago, when I went deep into the orc empire, I accidentally obtained a piece of parchment, which contained the formula for refining the life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I was in the Northland, I checked with the alchemist of my family, and I can confirm that the formula is true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the formula is missing a corner, and part of the content of smelting the magic core is missing. If there is a master alchemist to make a move, it is not a problem to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is the secret method, which is passed on by word of mouth and is not recorded on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your family is willing to spend a lot of money on research, you can still figure it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Your Excellency the Baron has a way to help me get rid of the troubles of the July Meeting, there is no problem in handing over the formula to Your Excellency.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that you can't do it now, so what can I get by handing over the formula to you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to threaten me in vain. At this point, I don't know when I will be sent to meet the Lord of Dawn! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a good deal to talk about, but it was a pity that Baron Kettley's last sentence ruined the atmosphere in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Made Hudson very speechless, is he that kind of person?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which time did he threaten someone when discussing business?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this kind of thing can't be explained. Once discussed, it will become more and more black.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If it is an intact formula, coupled with the matching refining method, then it must be invaluable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is a lack of matching refining methods, and even the formula is not complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency said that only the part of smelting the magic core is missing, but the recipe is incomplete.

Now I can only offer 20,000 gold coins, or something equivalent, so take a gamble! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this level of gamble is not easy for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the expenditure on formula purchases, the investment in later research and development is the real bulk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the Koslow family does not have its own master alchemist, so they can only turn to others for help, which will cost even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Compared with the risk I took, this benefit is not worth mentioning at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this incomplete prescription, I had a narrow escape.

It sounds simple, but if it is really implemented, it will be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The third article is not negotiable. Copying a copy sounds simple, but in fact it is pure blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no way to explain to other investors the high investment in research and development in exchange for the sharing of results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you want to come up with a complete formula, it is impossible to do it without countless experiments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was simple, your family would have already done it, so why bother to take it out to me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of investment is also not something that the Mountain Territory can afford, and the entire Koslow family may not be able to bear it either. I have to recruit people to share the risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you are willing to contribute formulas for free, or are willing to spend money in it, then cut off the third article, and we can continue to talk. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Baron Kettley also secretly complained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life essence formula is indeed priceless, even if it is incomplete, the value is not low, but this thing is not easy to sell!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Families with purchasing power don't need this stuff. The family that needs it can't afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although some mid-level nobles with shallow foundations also need this thing, but there are not many people in their mouths, and there is not a big gap in the life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I won't buy a copy for ten or eight years. It's not cost-effective at all. Why spend a lot of money on it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Kettler's own family, they gave up research and development because of the disproportionate input and output.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are few families like the Koslow family that have both needs and purchasing power in the entire Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't need the formula, but if your family researches it, it must be sold to me at a low price in the future.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettler fought hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't feel threatened and urgently needed to strengthen his strength, he wouldn't risk selling this thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking for Hudson, in addition to valuing the willingness of the Koslow family to buy, the more important thing is the reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire southeastern province knows that Baron Hudson will do what he says. There is no deceit in doing business. After signing the contract, it has never been broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no problem!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But let me state first, if the materials used to refine the life essence are too rare, I can't guarantee the quantity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, you can only obtain these life liquids for your own use, and it is forbidden to sell them to outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the tacit understanding of the major forces. If you think about it, you will not knowingly commit a crime and bring disaster to yourself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson agreed casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of strategic resource is not for making money. No matter how huge the profit is, he dare not sell it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Ketley's voice falling to the ground, it was announced that the transaction was officially completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    20,000 gold coins are naturally free, but Master Hudson is not so arrogant that he can take out 20,000 gold coins at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to do that, the cash flow of the territory may not be long before there will be problems. Hitting IOUs is the kingly way of trading.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the future payment in cash or product deduction, it depends on Baron Kettley's own choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's experience in debt, more than 90% of creditors will choose discounted goods to cover their debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"95% off\", this is his greatest sincerity to creditors. You can enjoy the same discount no matter you are purchasing any product from Mountain Land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the mountainous area currently only sells iron products, and no other industries can even see the bud. Greatly limit the consumption desire of creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off Baron Kettley, Hudson was embarrassed to find that he couldn't understand the formula of the life liquid in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Professional magic terms, in his opinion, are similar to the unique words of a certain industry in his previous life. Except for those within the circle who can understand it, the outsiders are all dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He stretched out his hand to wake up the sleeping cub lying behind him, and waved the parchment in front of Uncle Xiong's eyes a few times, only to meet Bear Stearns with a look of foolishness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson realized that he had done something stupid. His master's knowledge is limited. As a pet bear, how can his culture be so high?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the great ancestors of the Earth Bears, who left them with precious inheritance memories, with the style of this group of lazy people, it is estimated that they can turn themselves into pure illiteracy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These hidden magic terms were born in the last few hundred years and are not in the inherited memory. Bear Stearns is naturally as confused as Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to get Baron Kettley to translate, but in the end Hudson held back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Face is still important. Anyway, it was just a verbal white note, and the money was not paid, and I was not afraid of buying fake products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, uncles, how much do you know about the July Festival?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of rushing to mention the formula of the original life liquid, he first cared about the July meeting. It wasn't that Hudson couldn't distinguish the priority, but the actual need.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The formula of the incomplete life liquid can be researched at any time, but something will happen in July, and it is likely to be just around the corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have much information, he, the supplier of the July meeting, really has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This organization is very mysterious, it was born a hundred years ago, and no one knows the specific internal structure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, I found records about this organization in a note left by my great-grandfather.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the founders of this organization are a group of orphans of northern aristocrats who are unwilling to lose their foundations. The purpose at the beginning of its establishment was to avenge the five giants in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, there were still people who asked us to join, but the ancestral land was lost, the people in the branches were in panic, and there was no leader in the clan, so the matter was left alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are materials from a hundred years ago. After going through the vicissitudes of life, the group who founded the July Society have already done it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current organization may have undergone a qualitative change long ago. If you just want to seek revenge from the five giants and regain the lost foundation, there is absolutely no need to shout the slogan of overthrowing the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sean Knight's words awakened Hudson. If the Koslow family can survive, there will definitely be survivors of other northern nobles who lost their foundations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from those who went south, some of these people insisted on staying in the north. The in-law relationship between nobles is intricate, and it is not difficult to find a relative to join them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone takes advantage of the trend and sneaks into the five major families, Hudson will not be surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the gang of slave traders were descendants of nobles who had lost their inheritance in the past, then their actions now are understandable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, the five major families borrowed the hands of the orcs to destroy their family foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they are carrying forward the practice of the five major families, and they are also using the power of the orcs to avenge the five major families, which is completely justified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the case, then the Koslow family should stand with them. Only by subverting the rule of the five major families over the Northland can it be possible to get back the ancestral land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it in your heart. If it is really implemented, Hudson is still firmly opposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to start a war, but difficult to end it. Without enough strength, it would lead to a war rashly, and it would definitely be the Alpha Kingdom that would suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five major families in the Northland may collapse, but the nobles and nobles in the kingdom will not be able to please them. Maybe at some point, they will be forced to shed blood on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wins the battle and takes back the family ancestral land, Hudson is unwilling to be neighbors with orcs in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resisting the orc invasion cannot be achieved by the efforts of one lord or one family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom work together, and they can only be beaten passively. Only when countries on the mainland join forces can we win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, no matter who is stationed in the Northland, the situation is extremely embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"People from the July Society have been secretly purchasing weapons and equipment all over the kingdom recently, and they strongly demand that they only buy low-quality weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guangshan Territory has received orders enough to arm 30,000 troops. Judging from the size of some custom-made weapons, they don't seem to be used by ethnic soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I suspect that these weapons are intended to be smuggled to the Orc Empire, and are specially provided to the vassal races under the command of the five royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the inference is accurate, then the Orc Empire is preparing for war. At least one of the five royal families is preparing to invade the south. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the orc empire invades the south, it is not always that the five royal families are dispatched together. Only when there is an all-out war will they come out in full force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes one family comes, sometimes two people come, how many people come depends on their mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time the south is invaded, it drives countless vassal race cannon fodder to play the vanguard. Rather than saying it was a special invasion of the south, it was not to say that it was to consume the surplus population in the country and rob it along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alone against the previous orc royal invasion, the Alpha Kingdom is still not afraid. Encountering two orc royal families, sitting in the fortress for defense, they can barely cope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are more, please call for help!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that you have fought, you can't even defend. It can only trade space for time, resisting steadily on local battlefields, delaying time and waiting for reinforcements from various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry too much about this kind of thing, you can find that the high-level people in the kingdom are not fools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    July Club also lost his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to purchase ordnance, but it is not so simple to transport so many weapons and equipment to the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the garrison of the kingdom or the five major families of the Northland, they will try their best to intercept them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to paying attention to ordnance, you can actually pay attention to changes in the grain market. On the eve of the outbreak of previous wars, food prices will rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There will always be a gang of traitors trying to find ways to grab supplies for the orc empire. Some nobles in the kingdom, for their own benefit, turned a blind eye to this. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said indignantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at that expression, it seems that he can't wait to tear up those gangsters and greedy nobles who ignore the interests of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was extremely embarrassing for Hudson to be on the sidelines. According to this standard, he is definitely a member of the greedy nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the sellers of arms are not good products. The general environment is like this, and he also learned badly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the major arms dealers in the country, you can tell from the booming business that none of them refused these door-to-door orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Redman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting angry with those people has no meaning except that it can damage your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether or when the orc empire invades is not something we small people are qualified to ask.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was a real fight, it would be the guys from Beidi who had a headache first. Maybe this battle is a turning point for the family to regain their ancestral land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, according to our established plan, find a way to get more life essence, and train as many knights as possible to strengthen the strength of the family. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The oldest Knight Feder persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As people get older, the focus of attention is different. For Knight Feide, the biggest dream is to get back the ancestral land in his lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter which branch brought it back, as long as he can plant the flag of the Koslow family, that is his lifelong wish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the topic went off track, everyone started discussions around the recovery of the ancestral land, making Hudson like an outsider.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of attachment to the ancestral land from the bottom of his heart is beyond Hudson's understanding. The only thing he can do is to nod from time to time to show that he supports the recovery of the ancestral land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Participate in the discussion, then it will be free. It's not Hudson's passive sabotage, it's really everyone's strategic plan, which is so rough that it makes people speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it is more appropriate to make a wish under the statue of the Lord of Dawn instead of discussing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the discussion was almost over, Hudson asked slowly: \"Father, uncles, do you have any familiar alchemists?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or other branches, it is also possible to have contacts in this area. But it must be absolutely reliable, without any mistakes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why are you asking these questions, do you want to learn alchemy instead?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally raising an outstanding son, he didn't want to see Hudson fall into the pit of alchemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the circle of small nobles, there has been a saying: \"Magic is poor for three generations, and alchemy ruins one's life.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, these two gold-eating professions are not accessible to the poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the mountainous territory is developing well, it is still heavily in debt, and Hudson has nothing to do with Fu for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being a magician is nothing more than a gift from a monster, so you can't get it cheap and act like a good boy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson's astonishing monthly expenses still shocked Baron Redman, and completely made him stop the idea of ​​letting his juniors learn magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is capable, and he can handle a huge pit. If you jump into another pit, it's hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just this morning, I accidentally purchased a fragment of the formula of the original liquid of life. Most of the content on it is complete, but the part of smelting the magic core is missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to ask a reliable alchemist to help translate it, and by the way, calculate how much investment it will take to restore it...\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The raw liquid of life still needs to be obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thoughtful Hudson finally did not speak to the local nobles, but instead turned to the northern nobles who had a good relationship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Businessmen, if you don't have many others, you must have many friends. Regardless of the fact that the local nobles and the northern nobles belong to two camps, it does not affect the business between the two parties in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trade a few more times, and everyone will become acquaintances. The relationship is not far or close, it is just right to talk about this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Market price + 30% is Hudson's sincerity. Receive as much as you have, full of local tyrants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the price is high, but in fact this premium is paid for favors. In the past, trading in the circle required not only paying money, but also favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Koslow family's enemies in the North, it is estimated that the family knights would have gone to the North to fight and use their military exploits in exchange for the life essence for the younger generation. Not so embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will take a month or two to see how much life essence can be exchanged for. After all, there will be gains. If you can't get a copy, everyone will not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadeer City, the relationship between Hudson and the nobles of the Northland was closer, which quickly stimulated Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an outsider, without the strength of a strong dragon to overwhelm a local snake, then you have to integrate in after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith is also very aware of this, but how to integrate it is very particular. He, the boss, didn't even express his position. The younger brothers first eased the relationship with the local forces. What's the matter?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seemed like an ordinary business, but the Baron Sith, who was not low in political sensitivity, soon read something different from it—the decline in his control over his little brother!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, if you wanted to do business with local nobles, at least you had to send a representative to say hello to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now, everyone knew that he was taboo by the boss, and they reached an agreement with Hudson without saying a word, clearly ignoring him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aftermath of the Kettler incident exploded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not being able to make an example to the monkeys in time, the prestige of Baron Sith among the nobles of northern Xinjiang plummeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the strong rise of the Mountain Territory, a group of nobles in northern Xinjiang realized that if they continued to fight, they, outsiders, would suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, everyone will be happy to accept Hudson's kindness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a simple transaction, but it also depends on what is being traded. In the continent of Aslante, those who can trade the raw liquid of life are \"our own people\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it's still a deal with a price increase. Everyone can make a fortune from it once they are middlemen, so they can't refuse it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of interests, the nominal boss is worthless. Someone started and people didn't mind following suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The law does not blame the public. When everyone participates in the transaction, it means that no one participates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he received the news, Baron Sith, the boss, couldn't get to the bottom of this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to settle the matter, let's talk about it after you deal with the traitor “Kately” first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn Hudson, what is he trying to do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you really think that I am afraid of him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Provocation again and again, it's just...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith couldn't help cursing angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One inattentive, the competitor ran over to poach the wall again. With the precedent of Baron Kettley, Sith does not think how loyal the nobles of the Northland are to the group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that after Kettley betrayed his own camp, he would not be able to integrate into the local nobles, and would be collectively resisted by the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it turned out, he was purely self-indulgent. It was true that Ketley failed to integrate into the local nobles, but the northern nobles did not resist either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. Baron Sith believes that Baron Kettley is betraying, which does not mean that other nobles also think so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, Kettler did not do anything wrong to the group except for making a fool of Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the debt owed was quickly repaid after a short-term turnover, leaving no excuse for Baron Sith to liquidate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of a reason to call on everyone to act together, if you want to find Ketley's bad luck, you can only do it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a soft persimmon, the military strength of the Maple Leaf leader is close to three-sevenths of his, and the loss in the fight must be not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith is not an impulsive person. After considering the strength comparison between the two sides, he resolutely suppressed the idea of ​​doing something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military correct choice does not mean political correctness. For the children of northern nobles who worship the strong, Baron Sith's performance is undoubtedly not strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the identity starts with a big name, if you add \"illegitimate child\" in front of it, it becomes the object of everyone's common despise, envy and hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, there are still too many ambitious people. Secretly everyone is thinking about being the boss, and no one is willing to be reduced to a foil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, calm down!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anger will only fuel reason and make people make wrong decisions. There is nothing positive about the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a business, it doesn't mean anything. Now there are many people waiting for you to make mistakes, and any decision made out of anger will only make the enemy happy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun persuaded earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's an illusion, but he always feels that his young master seems to have been plotted against. After staying in Dadir City, he became irritable, and he was not at all like \"landslides in front of his eyes without changing his face\" when he was in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith was not the only one who had a similar reaction. After many northern noble children became lords, they did not control their emotions very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that everyone's sanity hadn't been affected, Fei Lun would have suspected that it was a collective curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson is here, he can give the answer at a glance-post-war psychological syndrome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evil spirit accumulated on the battlefield was not released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world has changed, and there are rules everywhere, and even a little bit of transgression is forbidden, and if you are wronged, you can only swallow it in your stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no place to vent when you are angry. If you feel aggrieved for a long time, it will naturally affect people's mood. Getting angry easily is just a basic expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I will pay attention.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard too many similar words, but the effect is getting smaller and smaller. Being able to forcibly suppress the anger in his heart is due to Baron Sith's determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, one transaction doesn't mean anything. Even if they want to ease the relationship, it can't be resolved with one transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a representative of the local nobles, Baron Hudson is also involuntary now. Even if he is willing to accept these people, he has to consider the reaction of his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to historical experience, if foreign nobles want to integrate into the local area, they often need two or three generations of joint management, which is definitely not less sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that these guys are all ambitious and pretentious, so how can they be willing to keep being low-key and small?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the form of Wright County, Wyton County actually needs more attention. After the Baron Cayo moved into Fallen Leaf Town, there was no movement at all, which is very abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, this person also took the initiative to visit the Mountain Territory. Perhaps the two had secretly reached an agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dispute over the right to speak within the local aristocrats, it is very likely that because of our existence, it will not erupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those in Wyton County were not at ease, they all wanted to compete for the position of Sheriff, even though they knew that Baron Cayo had come from a bad place, they couldn't unite. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Phelan analyzed with a wry smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rich life experience told him that the less action is taken, the bigger the storm is brewing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the northern nobles who went south had passively formed a whole. If there is a problem with the Northland nobles in Wyton County, Baron Sith will inevitably be involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, the two counties of Wright and Wyton are now a whole. How one side wins or loses will affect the outcome of the other side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, Baron Sith first controlled Wright County, and then supported his cronies to control Wyton County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the first step of the plan was aborted, and the situation in Wright County has evolved into a long-term confrontation. In the short term, it is impossible to tell the difference. On the contrary, the battle in Wyton County is easier to tell the winner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation in Wyton County is really not optimistic. Please post a post for me to make an appointment with those people. Even if they want to make trouble, they have to kick out their competitors first!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson is studying with the translated formula, as if he wants to transform into a master alchemist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Depending on others is worse than relying on yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to find a master alchemist. I begged my father, sued my grandma, and tried to solicit favors and relationships everywhere. It took me nearly two months before and after, but I only found an ordinary alchemist in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to help translate the formula, but it would be too embarrassing for others to prepare the life essence with an incomplete formula.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we will look at other branches. Anyway, all the family members in the southeastern province have done their best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cub on the side is even more awesome, holding the \"Blood Moon Horn\" which is frightened by the outside world as a toy. Push it up for a while, and shoot it down for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that the \"evil weapon\" is just different. No matter how much Bear Stearns tossed about the seemingly tattered horn, it did not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, none of the various weapons and armor in Hudson's collection could withstand a slap from Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce losses, Hudson issued a ban on Bear Stearns early. The Blood Moon Horn, which is durable and useless, becomes the cub's only toy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"boom!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the sound, Hudson blew up the furnace again. This situation has become the norm since gaining some simple alchemy knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the preparation of life essence as alchemy, and only Hudson can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the blackness, Hudson doesn't know if it is effective or not, let alone the elixir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He released the ingredients completely according to the recipe, because he lacked the key refining method, he could only try it by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: to smelt the magic core, Hudson manipulated the golden finger to **** up the energy in the magic core, and re-injected it into the residue of the magic core.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other raw materials are processed according to the formula requirements. Add a little water at the end, and it will become a black and autumnal paste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Put it in a pot for steaming, frying, and boiling, all of which ended in failure. In the end, I had no choice, so I simply threw it into the alchemy furnace and tossed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The master blacksmiths in this territory have also added a new side job, which is to build an alchemy furnace for Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have played with firewood and charcoal fire before. This time I played magic fireball. I may not be able to control the fire well, and I successfully tossed and broke a pill furnace again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, come and help me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson greeted the cub unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Bear Stearns cannot determine whether his achievements are fruitful, others can judge whether they are poisonous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are lessons learned. Anything that the cubs think can't be eaten will definitely kill animals. Prior to this, countless animals had contributed their lives to Hudson's scientific research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bear stretched out its paw, and looked at the black elixir with disgust. Then, under Hudson's gaze, he stuffed it directly into his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed is so fast that Hudson has no time to stop it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, I just let you watch it, but I didn't let you try it. I won't be responsible if you eat it and ruin your stomach!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is his own bear, naughty is a bit naughty, but he is still qualified as a bodyguard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the toss is broken, who should be responsible for the personal safety of his master Hudson?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrange escorts?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not Hudson who destroys his prestige. Even if the most capable soldiers in the mountain territory were found, it would not be enough for a bear's paw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The taste is a bit bad, but I can barely swallow it. Hudson, it seems that you still have the talent of an alchemist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continue to work hard to improve the taste and appearance, it is best to add some honey, animal milk, and some sugar...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' words made Hudson put his heart back. He glared at the foodie angrily, and started a new round of alchemy on his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific effect is not sure yet, but there are two things for sure: eating bears will not kill them, and it is good for the growth of bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what will happen if people eat it, further experiments are needed before conclusions can be drawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the resistance of the Earth Bear is far beyond that of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Hudson's guess is completely right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a dozen rabbits and two wild deer ate it and exploded on the spot, he had to admit that the pill he made was a raging feed pill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the dose was diluted with water, none of the animals that became test subjects left the laboratory alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Misfortune destroyed the medicinal materials worth more than five thousand gold coins, and Hudson finally stopped the experiment. Now he has a deep understanding of what it means to \"destroy a life with alchemy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a complete blood loss, at least he has achieved a result. Although it is very tasteless, Bear Stearns mostly complains about this unappetizing pill, and it is the result after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first time you engage in research and development, you can produce results. Regardless of whether the results are weak or not, if you take it to the outside world, you can be called a \"talented alchemist\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most alchemists grew up in this way. Every alchemist's medicine refining technique is unique.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to imitate, you can't imitate. Even if it is the master-student inheritance, it is very different when it is implemented in the details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, it was the purchased life essence, which solved the urgent need. However, the family's research and development plan for the original liquid of life, under Hudson's efforts to persuade, was finally put on hold for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without your own alchemist, spending money on research and development for others is definitely a **** business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A person as sensible as himself can lose thousands of gold coins at one time, and replace them with those lunatics who alchemy. God knows how much it will cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that in the laboratory, investors like them don't know whether they are researching life essence or doing something else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a master alchemist hosting it, that's all. No matter what the level of people is, the money spent is almost the same, and the results will still be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Switched to an ordinary alchemist whose ability is yet to be determined, Hudson felt that he might as well do it himself. At the very least, he is still a person with one achievement. Most so-called alchemists can only copy the achievements of their predecessors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not bad to be able to plagiarize, the most important thing is that even if the plagiarism is intact, you can only get 50 or 60 points out of 100 points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that they don't work hard, it's that there are no specific standards for many things, and they can only be judged subjectively based on experience. In this line of work, talent and luck are more important than hard work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention that the efficacy of medicinal materials is difficult to judge, even if it is the same magic core, two different ones have completely different energy inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the refined magic potion configuration, any deviation will affect the final result. Hudson's experiment is the best example. Originally, it was intended to prepare life essence, but in the end it could only be used to feed bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, I just received news. A plague of locusts has appeared in neighboring provinces and is attacking the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that there is also the leader of the worm king who was promoted to Warcraft. He has a lot of wisdom and has avoided the hunting of the kingdom organization many times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Governor's Office issued a strict order ordering everyone to prepare for the fight against the locust plague. At the same time, a reward order was issued, one thousand gold coins for killing a bug king. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving this bad news, Hudson almost vomited three liters of blood. It's fine if the alchemy fails, and now the plague of locusts is also coming to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the locust plague spreads to the southeastern provinces, a sharp rise in food prices is inevitable. However, the mountainous areas are still unable to achieve food self-sufficiency, and the income from hard work for a year may not be enough to make up for the losses caused by the soaring food prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rising food prices is not the worst thing. The most terrible thing is that even if you have money, you can't buy food. After every locust plague, there will be a purgatory on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially with the appearance of the Warcraft Insect King, even if the nobles and lords try their best to rescue the disaster, it will be difficult to contain the locust plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to dealing with locusts, knights are definitely not as good as magicians, but looking at the pitiful number of magicians, they can't be counted on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a magic can easily kill tens of thousands of locusts, it is still a drop in the bucket compared to the huge number of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If locusts really attack the mountain leaders, then Hudson can only lead the people to eat locusts. I just don't know how the locusts in the Aslant continent taste like, and whether they can be eaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, immediately lead people to strengthen the warehouse, and replace all parts with stone materials. Notify the security chiefs to suspend the land reclamation operation, and organize manpower to grab the grain that is about to mature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vegetables grown in the field and wild vegetables grown in the mountains should be harvested and stored in the sun as much as possible. Remember not to damage the roots. If there is no locust plague, there will be harvest later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forage reserves must also be arranged. This matter is very important, and I will leave it to Nick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    in addition…\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 125": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 125: the other side of nobility\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    After arranging the relevant work, Hudson's first reaction was to rush to buy food, and then he gave up this idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The urgent mail from the Governor's Mansion was sent out at the same time, and it was almost the latest to be received in the area of ​​the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point in time, I ran to buy food. I don't know if there is any food for sale. Anyway, the price has already skyrocketed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the plague of locusts spreads to the southeastern province, the food order contracts originally signed with various companies will definitely have to be voided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson has the habit of storing grain. Based on the inventory in the territory and the part of the grain that was looted, it should not be a big problem to support the next spring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the precondition is that the locust plague ends as soon as possible, and it cannot harm the autumn harvest and affect the next season's grain planting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If even autumn plowing is harmed by locusts, it will be a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a major grain-producing province, a locust plague would not have a serious impact on the southeastern province itself. Even with a sharp reduction in grain production, the nobles were still able to tide over the crisis with their own reserves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces in northern Xinjiang, which are heavily dependent on food supplies from other provinces in the kingdom, are really facing a crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area affected by the locust disaster is not small. The southeastern province is only an early warning, and large-scale disasters have already occurred in nearby provinces. However, these provinces in the south happen to be the main food producing areas of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only one season of autumn grain production was reduced or no harvest. Out of overall considerations, everyone gritted their teeth and would not reduce the grain supply to northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the autumn plowing is affected, and next year's spring grain will be directly destroyed by locusts, there is no other way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When things got to that point, noble lords everywhere also had to face food shortages. At that time, there will be too much time for self-care, let alone a large amount of food to support northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead, Hudson suddenly realized that he was thinking too much. These issues are considered by big people, so why should a small person like him worry about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has existed for so many years, and this is not the first time it has encountered a famine. It has been able to survive it in the past. It makes no sense that it will suddenly fail this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the farming era, everyone has the habit of storing grain to prepare for shortages. If it is only for personal use, the food reserves of the minor nobles can survive the famine for two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By taking some special measures, it will last longer. But for any nobles with some inheritance, each family is not lacking in experience in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food reserves of the great nobles will only become more abundant. The five major families in the Northern Xinjiang area are dominant, which was originally a disadvantage for defense, but now it has become a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't believe it, the five major families were not prepared at all. If it is true that there are only a few months of food reserves on the surface, the orc empire will go to grab a ghost?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Zooming in on the entire continent, even if the Alpha Kingdom suffers from a famine, it doesn't mean that all human nations have suffered from a famine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the goalkeepers of various countries in the human race, when you reach out for help in times of crisis, you can't sit idly by, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the few nearby neighbors would definitely not dare to watch the Alpha Kingdom collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a careful analysis, Hudson found that the situation in the kingdom was okay, but the real crisis was the Mountain Territory, or the two counties of Wright and Wyton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a newly developed territory, except for harvesting one season of spring grain, the rest is still in the field. The locust plague is about to strike, and even if some of the crops can be harvested, a reduction in production is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wheat seedlings are all green, and harvesting now is not so much grain as green storage fodder. This year's summer grain production will definitely be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have enough reserves, so the harvest in the bare land will definitely not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles can still rely on their own family for support, while the northern nobles can only sadly pay for \"sky-high price food\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to have money in your pocket. If you have no money and no food, Hudson dare not think about what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the land of the two counties is going to be uneven, and it will even affect the adjacent areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bandits\" and \"Bandits\", these criminal gangs that have just been strangled to extinction, will revive in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the arms business is about to usher in a new wave of market prices, but this is not what Hudson wants. He needs food more now than orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, the impact on the mountainous areas is relatively small. At the very least, mung beans, peas, and sesame seeds... have a high probability of escaping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these things are not planted in large quantities, only a few thousand acres. The main crops are rye, potatoes, and soybeans, all of which are within the diet of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same plague of locusts, the same troubles. A group of noble lords who received the news threw themselves into the fight against the locust plague as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hurry up to harvest what can be harvested quickly, even if harvested at this time, it can only be used as fodder to feed animals, that is better than losing everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Baron Sith, who was going to settle accounts with Hudson, gave up his hatred at this moment. After issuing an order prohibiting the transportation of grain out of the city, he led the team straight to Beida City to snap up grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, other lords are working hard to farm, but he is working hard to restore Dadir City, and the area of ​​land reclaimed is not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect is also very significant. Dadir City, which has recovered a bit of vitality, soon became a commercial center among the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The income earned is not less than that of farming, and it is also profitable to buy food directly with money, and there is no need to worry about land issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Dadir City, which relies heavily on outsourcing, has to face the \"food shortage\" problem caused by the locust plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that after the autumn grain harvest, I would purchase a large amount of cheap grain at one time as a year's grain reserve. I didn't expect that I didn't take advantage of it, but instead ushered in this bad news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the prices given by various grain stores, Baron Sith almost vomited blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before receiving the news of the \"locust plague\", the price of rye in the city was only 3.5 copper coins per pound, and there were discounts for large-scale purchases, but it was slightly more expensive than buying directly from noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, the sky-high price of ten copper coins a pound of rye is soaring, without bargaining, Baron Sith really has no way to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have seen price increases, but I have never seen such a crazy increase. The locust plague is just a news, and it hasn't really killed it yet?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What if all the insect kings are killed and the plague of locusts is brought under control?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, under the shadow of panic, the entire market has gone crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grain grabbing has already spread in the city. Just looking at the free people lined up in a row, you can tell how anxious everyone is at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of the famine, the free people who were not doing well in the first place were not as capable of resisting risks as the serfs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in the face of a crisis, serfs and noble lords are running ahead. Unless it is absolutely necessary, we will not let the serfs under our rule starve to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most vulnerable group of people, once they fall into bankruptcy, the fate waiting for them is worse than that of serfs. Either be starved to death, or sold as slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Panic buying is often linked to price increases, especially after a group of grain merchants learned that the lords of Wright and Wyton counties were going to purchase grain on a large scale, it stimulated their enthusiasm for price increases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grain merchants in the city raised their prices collectively. If they didn't want to bear the sky-high price, they could only go directly to the noble lord's house to buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before that, maybe you can try it. Among the nobles and lords who have received the news of the locust plague, who doesn't want to sell their food?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is surplus food for sale, people must give priority to protecting their \"own people\". Unless they can offer an undeniable sky-high price, it will be difficult for them, a group of outsiders, to purchase enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including these grain merchants, if they were not worried that they would have a large amount of grain in their hands during the disaster year, which would cause the prying eyes of the nobles and lords, and their lives would not be guaranteed, they would not have made such a quick move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, purchase as quickly as possible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry about the price. As long as you can still buy food, you can count as much as you can buy. After a while, even if you have money, it will be difficult to buy food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the grain in the hands of these grain merchants is sold out, it will be difficult for a second batch to appear in the next few months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locust plague is raging. If an extreme situation occurs, the Governor's Office may not take care of us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fei Lun hurriedly persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a housekeeper, he was also heartbroken. Dardir City finally got on the right track, and this kind of thing happened right away. This luck, I really don't know what to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"shopping!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said while holding back the pain in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have money, you can't take care of it. If you don't have food, you will really starve to death. As a qualified lord, if a large number of subjects under his command were to starve to death, he would be drowned by saliva.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luoye Town also received news of the outbreak of the locust plague. Baron Cayo was much calmer, as if nothing had happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picking up a bowl of boiling tea, exhaled lightly, and said calmly: \"It seems that the Lord of Dawn has taken care of me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plague of locusts actually came to the door by itself, so there is no need to continue the original plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can be a gentleman, who wants to be a villain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to control Wyton County justifiably, Baron Cayo didn't want to engage in conspiracy and tricks, and let people talk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a famine breaks out, whoever has food in their hands will be the boss of the county. Even if other ambitious people compete, they have to be able to fill everyone's stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Wyton County, apart from Baron Cayo, who is backed by the Dalton family, who can solve the food shortage problem, which lord dares to be so proud?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, as long as you use a little tricks, everyone can only admit cowardly. Who let him eat other people's food and have a short mouth?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how unconvinced he is in his heart, he has no face to compete with Baron Cayo after owed such a huge favor. Otherwise, the spittle stars from the outside world can teach them how to behave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, just one news is not enough. It is best that the locust team really attacked Wyton County, so that it can put enough pressure on all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can also piggyback on Wrightshire if you wish. In the face of this natural disaster, no matter whether it is the son of the Grand Duke or the son of the chosen one, they all have to bow their heads. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler on the side suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are not ruthless, and they cannot stand firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles from all over the world are organizing people to intercept the locusts, but in the face of the overwhelming army of locusts, how many can be left behind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All that everyone can do is to kill the leading insect king. As for the small shrimp below, there is really nothing you can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the swarm led by the insect king, it is just headless flies scurrying around, wherever they go, what is the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The threat is relatively small, but that's only a few. Randomly wandering to any place will be a devastating blow to the local ecology.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Big cities can also organize magicians and set up magic circles for protection, but in the vast countryside, there is really no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If locusts were deliberately introduced into the two counties, it is conceivable that the noble lords of Wright and Wyton counties would be hit hard economically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's wait and see first, the locusts are uncontrollable after all, it is best to intercept them outside the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the interception fails, then a wave of locusts will flow to the two southern counties, and everyone can accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't act yet, and make a decision after discussing with your uncle. As a magician, I will answer the call of the kingdom and participate in the fight against the plague of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next affairs in the territory, I will leave it to you, Faber. Everything is based on stability, and other minor issues can be put on hold first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that his heart is very contradictory. From the standpoint of the Dalton family, it is undoubtedly the best choice to intercept the locusts outside the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if the locust plague breaks out, the Dalton family, which has the largest land area, will bear the heaviest losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the aristocratic system, the land is owned by the nobles, and there is no way to take the opportunity to annex the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss is all his own, not to mention, as the boss of the southeast province, the Dalton family is also obliged to help the younger brothers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the specific step of rescue, it is definitely not acceptable to sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hemorrhage is inevitable. It is not a big problem to starve a few serfs to death, but to starve a nobleman to death, that is big news that sensationalizes the whole country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But from his standpoint, Baron Cayo very much hoped that this plague of locusts would become a big one. Only when there is trouble, can he appear as a savior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking his relief rations not only ended the lordship battle, but also took the opportunity to create a tall image for himself, a typical example of fame and fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beida City, the administrative center of the southeastern province for the first time, Hudson did not pay attention to this big city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a \"magician\", Hudson was also recruited by the Governor's Palace. To be precise, it was his bear that the Governor's Mansion wanted to recruit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This can be seen from the treatment. Obviously just a small mage, Hudson directly enjoyed the treatment at the level of a magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The super high salary made Hudson very bottomless. This remuneration is the outside world's assessment of Bear Stearns' strength, but the actual strength of Bear Stearns is purely a muddle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all due to the laziness of the Earth Bears, who directly divide their strength by size, completely ignoring exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no reference object and no reasonable evaluation standard, it is a mess to determine the strength of the cub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I thought I would create a vague image and let the outside world guess. I didn't expect to be able to catch up with this kind of incident, so Bear Stearns had to go to the front desk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sighing secretly, Hudson enjoyed it with peace of mind. The remuneration offered was high, which was provided by the Governor's Mansion, not what he asked for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Bear Stearns is not as powerful as the magister, it can only prove that the people in the Governor's Mansion are ineffective, and it has nothing to do with his master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rights and obligations are equal. After accepting this wave of recruitment, the military service tasks for the next three years are considered completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is theoretical. If there is an emergency, no matter whether there is a military service task or not, those who should be recruited will still be recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, this locust plague is a compulsory recruitment task. All the magicians in the southeastern province were recruited by the governor's mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some knights with monster mounts were also included in the scope of recruitment. On the contrary, ordinary knights were excluded from the scope of recruitment because their damage to locusts was too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 150 magicians + more than 20 knights, all gathered together, if it was said that the scene was not preparing for war, no one would believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are unfamiliar faces, and occasionally I meet a few familiar faces, which means that Hudson knows others, and they don't know him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not interested, Hudson, who was looking for acquaintances among the crowd, directly chose to sit down in a corner, enjoying the food alone, as if he didn't fit in with this banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, it's not that he doesn't want to blend in. It's really that the mage group is too exclusive, and it's hard for him, a guy who doesn't have half a bucket of water, to join the topic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Cavaliers are relatively easy to deal with, but that is only relative. Among the knights present, only Hudson was weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst is for the others to start with the big knights, and they can't be weaker. Knights who are not strong enough become \"poo\" in the process of obtaining the mount of a monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these guys are not cultivators, they are almost cultivators. The content of the discussion was also about topics related to cultivation, but Hudson still couldn't join in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of the aristocratic ladies and noble ladies originally imagined appeared at this banquet. Occasionally there are a few Miss Magicians, and that is not something Hudson can get close to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small transparency also has the advantage of being a little transparent, that is, you don't have to socialize. As long as the skin is thick enough, you can eat and drink as much as you want.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called aristocratic etiquette, unfortunately, this is not the home of pretenders. All the powerhouses present were from the unrestrained sect, and they all came here as they liked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the burly knight opposite Hudson, while discussing with his companions **** the king of insects, while holding a leg of lamb to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the image of the people around is slightly better, it is not much better overall. Picking up the cup is often a mouthful of stuffiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules, everyone's habits are the rules. As strong people, they no longer need to take into account the world's views.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, those guys who are polite and full of image and temperament are at the bottom of the food chain at the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did he not despise other people's eating habits, but he kept complimenting them from the sidelines. The status is high or low, anyone who sees it can tell at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the noble ladies are not allowed to participate in this kind of banquet. The scene in front of them is really far from the noble life in their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is precisely this group of imageless guys who stand at the top of the food chain in the southeastern province. Perhaps many of them are not well-known and rarely appear in the outside world, but they are definitely the core of a family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone doesn't care about image, and Hudson also follows the trend. Although he is a strong man with moisture, there is still no stage of pretending to face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to participate in this banquet is itself a symbol of status and strength. The younger generation has been told countless times by their parents, to be safe, to be safe, to be safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too arrogant, if you offend a strong man with eccentricities, you don't know how to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eating in a low-key manner, while eavesdropping on everyone's conversation, everything was fine. With Bear Stearns lazy, Hudson directly became the center of the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of the troublesome bear cub, he looked at Hudson embarrassedly, and started to scan the goods on his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picked up the plate and poured it into his mouth, Hudson was so angry that he wanted to kick the thing out. It's really embarrassing, it's as if his master didn't let the bear eat enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the usual food is not up to this level, it is still full, and the bear has not been hungry no matter what!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if it was a beginning, the painting style of the banquet took a sudden turn for the worse. All kinds of monsters jumped out one after another and joined the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson, who had been prepared for his death, immediately calmed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not enough for our own bear to be ashamed alone. Since everyone's monsters have jumped out, it is equivalent to how the banquet should be held.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the embarrassment of the guests, Hudson secretly breathed a sigh of relief. It turned out that he was far from the only one who couldn't control his own monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe in order to keep the monsters safe at the banquet, these guys promised a lot of conditions in advance. It's just that the temptation of delicious food is too great, and my own bear has made another bad start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unrealistic to stop it. Everyone signed an equal contract with Warcraft, and both parties must give each other enough respect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe in order to make Warcraft agree to be a magic pet, many people secretly promised additional conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Warcraft's IQ is not low, and without enough benefits, it is difficult to get them to agree to sign a contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear of the Earth!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This **** charm is irresistible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the face of the bear of the earth, the number of people greeting Hudson has increased a lot. It's just that he is still an outsider to the whole banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to become a strong person, you must endure the unbearable loneliness of ordinary people, and your communication skills can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind that is both the boss of one power and the strongest of one power mostly only exists in the families of minor nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the real big forces, the strongest are often those who abandon secular power and devote themselves to cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To spend the whole day drinking and drinking, busy with worldly chores, and want to surpass the decades of hard work of others, that is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there can be resource assistance, it does not mean that these hard-working guys will disappear. All the major forces spent a lot of money to cultivate their own cultivation geniuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in normal times, it is not cost-effective to train these masters. The same resources are used to train the army, and the combat effectiveness that can explode will be stronger, but it is different when encountering emergencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, in this locust plague, even if there are more ordinary troops, it will be futile to face the army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the dense army of locusts, the only ones who could find and kill the insect king were the experts present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar application scenarios. For a big force, when playing games with others, you can not use these masters, but you cannot live without them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In political games, the presence of top experts is often the best deterrent. A lot of unnecessary troubles can be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the looming activities of everyone on the field, Hudson still faintly discovered the existence of the circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no surprise, the Dalton family has the largest number of strong people, close to 40% of the total number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are several middle-class nobles in the province, and there are also strong people. As few as a few people, as many as more than ten people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the minor noble with the largest number of people, and there are few shadows here. Even if there were a few people who attended the banquet, they were still on the fringes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No dragon can grow in shallow water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the largest population base, it is still beyond imagination for a small noble who lacks resources to give birth to a strong man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are qualified to participate in the banquet, it does not mean that they will have the right to speak. None of the loudest voices on the field came from minor noble families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One's own strength is insufficient, so in this kind of occasion, one can only keep a low profile, and keep a low profile. Otherwise, if someone caught him and beat him up, he would be ashamed to face others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is one of the exceptions. Although he is very low-key, his own bear is extraordinarily high-profile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the ancestors of the Earth Bear were strong enough to leave a great reputation in the continent of Aslante. Regarding the performance of Bear Stearns, everyone did not say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if some people are dissatisfied, no one dares to slander before they are not sure about Bear Stearns' strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People and monsters having dinner together, the chaotic banquet, the scene is really not dare to look directly at.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It lasted until Earl Pierce entered the arena. I thought everyone would give this big man some face, Hudson also specially reminded Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reality is very slap in the face, and those who stand up to greet them are all a bunch of small characters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the bigwigs present did not pay attention to the governor at all. Eat what you should eat, drink what you should drink, and those who are bragging are still bragging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is fighting against the bear, was also fortunate to be a sitting wave, and did not meet him to flatter him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treatment has always been earned by oneself, and we cannot expect others to give us alms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hosts all believe that the cubs have the strength of a magister, and Hudson is also happy to pretend to be Xiong, so he doesn't do things that lose his value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few symbolic responses, Earl Pierce walked to the center of the hall and said solemnly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The purpose of inviting everyone here today, I think you all know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of locusts has now ravaged Fengyun Province. All the interceptions by the local aristocratic organizations failed, and most of the areas affected by the locusts had no food harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news reported by Fengyun Province, the locusts are currently heading towards our southeastern province. Maybe two days, maybe three days, the overwhelming army of locusts will enter Arbor County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I leave the fate of the southeastern province in your hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can't kill the insect king in time and stop the locust army from looting, I'm afraid our southeastern province will follow in the footsteps of Fengyun province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nonsense, so I won't say more. Tomorrow morning, I will rush to Qiaomu County together, trying to stop the army of locusts out of the country...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The efficient handling method surprised Hudson. Originally, I thought that there would be routine discussions and wrangling, but I didn't expect to announce the result as soon as it came up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not aristocratic at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is precisely the best way to deal with it right now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plague of locusts is imminent. If you don't hurry up and organize people to kill the insect king, it will be too late when the swarms enter the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if the insect king is successfully killed, it does not mean that the disaster is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the insect swarm led by the insect king, the destructive power is still terrible. The only advantage is that after losing the leader, their actions will be uncontrolled, and they will not swarm into the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that disasters are inevitable. What everyone can do is to kill locusts as much as possible, reduce the number of swarms, and reduce their destructiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone's foundation is in the southeast province, which can be regarded as a grasshopper on a rope. The army of locusts swept in, and no one's property could be favored. Naturally, no one will mess around at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's incredible that everything went smoothly, even if there were differences of opinion. Due to the needs of the overall situation, each of them also chose to hold it in their stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, the Earl is welcome!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maid's voice surprised Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet was over, and I thought I could go back and sleep well, but I never expected to be retained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he has met several times, there is no friendship between him and Earl Pierce. On the contrary, there are still a few small holidays.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last time in Dardir City, I was wearing small shoes. That unpleasant memory is still fresh in Hudson's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lead the way ahead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking for him at such a time, it is impossible to wear small shoes again, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is deliberately targeted, Earl Pierce may have a chance to make use of it. There is no point in making troubles at this juncture and affecting the great cause of fighting locust plagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the maid to the living room, looking at the seven chairs arranged, Hudson sat down very consciously in the last seat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience told him that those who can come to discuss matters at this time are all big shots in the province. As a late pawn, it's better not to be annoying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the **** was warmed up, several people entered the hall one after another, all of whom had been photographed at the banquet just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific strength is unknown, but it looks like an ordinary person. It should be back to basics, there is no way to judge strength based on the strength of breath, the only thing that can be sure is stronger than oneself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, is your bear an adult yet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the voice and looking back and forth, the person who asked the question was a benevolent old magician. It's just that Hudson doesn't have a good impression of this person at all, can he reveal his cards casually?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Yuli, don't you think this problem is over?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet just now, he was not without gains. After eavesdropping and observing, Hudson had a preliminary date on how to get along with these old guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Polite, meaningless. There are too many flatterers around me, and I have already been immune to it. They won't treat you differently just because of your kindness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only strength can make these guys catch the eye. If the strength is not enough, no matter who it is, they will not buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ask the old guy, what is the specific background, Hudson didn't figure it out. Anyway, his address to Earl Pierce was—Junior Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The governor is so shameless, Hudson doesn't think he can be respected if he answers honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This question is indeed a bit presumptuous. It's just that we old guys are very familiar with each other, but your bear strength is not clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we must cooperate with each other to deal with the locusts. It is also a practical need to know the strength in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the Earth Bear will awaken the Gravity Domain after it reaches adulthood, which can affect a large part of the surrounding space.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horror of the locust army lies in its quantity, and its individual strength is almost negligible. Even the worm king of advanced monsters has pitifully low strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If your bear can use the field of gravity, or slightly affect the pressure of space. So it is definitely of great significance to fight against locust plagues. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Yuli explained with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looks like a kind grandpa next door. If he hadn't seen this old guy arguing with others at the banquet, maybe Hudson would have believed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"So that's the case, Mage Yuli can rest assured. The sequence of Earth Bear's talent awakening has always been random. It just so happens that Bear Stearns prefers gravity magic, so his talent in this area is quite good.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be calm and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asking about a spell is fine, but if you want to know whether the Earth Bear is an adult, you don't have to even think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe on other occasions, the Earth Bear may not necessarily be the opponent of these old guys, but when it comes to fighting minions, Bear Stearns is definitely worth ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, but the staying power is strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason why the Bear of the Earth was able to break into the title of \"King of the Earth\" is that by stepping on the ground, he can continuously absorb energy supplements from the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of replenishment is dozens of times faster than that of a magician picking up a magic spar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemies were all scumbags like locusts, Bear Stearns would work from morning to night without any fatigue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just release some magic that consumes less. The energy replenishment speed of the Earth Bear can fully catch up with the output.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is absolutely unmatched by human magicians. Not to mention releasing magic for a day, and being able to fight for three or four hours, that is a proper strongman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle will last for several days, even for several months. Those are legends. As a normal person, there is no way to compare with the legendary pervert.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce, who arrived belatedly, terminated this unpleasant conversation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expected combat deployment did not appear at this moment. Considering that the enemy this time is a locust that does not play according to the routine, it seems that it is better to deploy in advance than to adapt to the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I said everything I needed to say at the banquet just now. The few people left are mainly to deal with the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, there may be more than one worm king in the swarm this time, and there may even be a legendary worm king born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to find these guys in the vast army of locusts and kill them. Looking at the entire southeastern province, there are only a few who can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others participated in this operation, mainly as assistants. Even if they encountered the insect king, it would be difficult to kill him under the cover of the army of insects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can rest assured that as long as you can keep the locusts out of the southeast province, or kill all the kings in the swarm, the benefits that belong to you are indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary goods, presumably everyone would look down on them. Afterwards, you can exchange some precious cultivation resources with the Governor's Mansion according to your respective contributions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific list is here. If you want something other than the list, as long as it is available in various companies in the southeastern province, I can also help coordinate it, but there is no guarantee that you will be able to exchange it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Earl Pierce's words, Hudson instantly understood. No wonder the bounty for killing an insect king is only a mere thousand gold coins. It is impossible for ordinary people to complete this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reward is set too high, there must be \"reckless people\" under the reward. A group of foolish people rushed into the swarm of insects, and instead of killing the insect king, they were overthrown by the locusts, which would be a shame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the mission cannot be completed, there is no need to show them the real mission reward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To save them from failing to do things and doing more than bad things. If the insect king was disturbed in advance and the opponent was prepared, it would actually increase the difficulty of hunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the treasures on the list, more than two-thirds of them, Hudson didn't even know what they were. But this does not affect his attention to these items.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resources that can assist high-level professionals in their cultivation are precious anywhere. Even if you don't use it yourself, you can take it out and exchange it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the powerful people present are the core figures of the major forces. Even if you put 100,000 gold coins in front of you, it may not be able to make them tempted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these cultivation resources can mobilize everyone's enthusiasm. In high society, these resources are definitely better than gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the plague of locusts should have scared the major forces. Even these rare treasures are taken out at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking around, Hudson suddenly noticed something was wrong. It seems that other than himself, these old guys are members of all major forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take out the treasures by yourself, and divide them among your family. All the expenses afterwards were shared by the noble lords in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder it was so generous, it was originally prepared for these people. After taking out the co-authored things and turning them around, it was reasonable to ask all the nobles to pay for the reimbursement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe these things have been allocated in advance. The so-called exchange is just a cover-up for everyone to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prerequisite is: be able to solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the interception of locusts fails, or if they fail to kill the insect king, then everyone's busy work will be in vain. If the problem cannot be solved, the small and medium-sized nobles below will not obediently pay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this is why Hudson was able to enter here. After all, the Earth Bear is really tough on small soldiers like locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Earth Bear, but most of the Warcraft races are very lethal to locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the aura of the high-level monster was released, all the locusts within a radius of tens of meters, or even hundreds of meters, were all dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the previous locust plagues, you can see the scope of these guys' activities. The swarms always avoided the Warcraft inhabited areas, and no insect king had ever led a team to attack the Warcraft Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know if the feces of monsters can scare locusts. If it works, Hudson still can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although his bears eat more, they pull less. I don't know where the food is eaten, and it doesn't conform to the law of conservation of mass at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the poor feces, the fertility is really good. It must be diluted many times before it can be irrigated into the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, do you have any disagreement?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's words made Hudson instantly wake up from his association. If the items on the list are pre-determined, it will be embarrassing for him, a temporary migrant worker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's grab it together with these gangsters, not to mention that it is easy to offend people, and you may be severely beaten by the society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, rules are made by the strong. It is also a matter of course for people to use their privileges to make a small modification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't compete with these guys, Hudson feels panicked?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't just paddle all the way and let the locust plague plunder, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other things, Master Hudson is a professional water rower, but this time the situation is obviously different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the plague of locusts run rampant, and the mountain leaders will not be able to escape either. Hudson will definitely not do it if he lifts a rock and shoots himself in the foot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if I exchange the credit I have obtained with other people for something else, it should be allowed, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, this kind of insider trading should be strictly cracked down. The best example is military merit. The kingdom stipulates with the most stringent laws and regulations: any transaction of military merit is prohibited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to protect the interests of small and medium nobles, the kingdom has always had zero tolerance for such things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once discovered, not only will the military merits be lost, but even the status of nobility will be deprived. Even the family behind him will be implicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting the locust plague is not a war, but in a sense, it still belongs to the same category as military exploits. Participating in this kind of combat is also considered military service.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the credit is great enough, for example: killing the legendary \"worm emperor\" and saving the loss of the kingdom, it is also possible to be knighted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"no!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules are rules, and no one is allowed to violate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever owns the credit is his, and no one can take it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said righteously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just his encouraging eyes, clearly telling Hudson: The boy is good, he can get on the road so soon, he has a future!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the few people who attended the meeting together looked at Hudson kindly. Obviously, as long as you don't compete with them for precious cultivation resources, other problems are fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him made Hudson completely give up. Sure enough, there is nothing new under the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a world where the class is highly monopolized and solidified, how can there be no insider operations?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a latecomer, being able to share a share of the action is because the big man pays attention to eating. If you run to **** food over your own means, then get ready to be beaten by the society!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you for the reminder, Lord Earl, Hudson has been taught!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson took the opportunity to salute Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Show with practical actions that he is a good boy who understands the rules, only takes what he deserves, and will never cross the line and reach out to things that should not be touched.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The intensified locust plague quickly attracted the attention of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, with the frequent reports from all over the world, Caesar III is not in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you found out about the locust plague?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is it naturally occurring?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or artificial? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the king's soul-like torture, all the ministers lowered their heads one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the cause of the locust plague was so easy to find out, it is estimated that the problem would have been solved long ago. The provinces are not in a hurry until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike other things, the capital can also send expert reinforcements. In the face of this level of locust plague, even if all the experts from all over the country are gathered there, there is no guarantee that it will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All you can do is to find the insect king who has transformed into a monster as soon as possible. For the remaining insect swarms, there is only one way to do it: smoke and burn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, organizing manual hunting is also indispensable. Catch with cloth, with net, with... are all routine operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of the Lord of the Dawn, the existence of the Locust God, who is not popular, can't scare the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the plague of locusts came so quickly that it broke out in several provinces at the same time, and then quickly spread to all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just judging from the killed insect king corpses, some insect kings do have the possibility of artificial breeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be sure, we need more samples. It is best to be able to catch the living insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, even if it is determined that it was planned by humans, based on the existing information, it is still difficult for us to determine which party is behind it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland replied boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting a powerful king, the life of the prime minister is doomed to be difficult. Caesar III is too shrewd, and the bureaucratic routines of muddy mud and Tai Chi are not easy to use here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that the real answer was unsatisfactory, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland still uttered the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As long as it is determined to be man-made, then it is enough. There are many powerful forces capable of planning this matter, but there are not many who will lay hands on us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either the orcs did it, or the Holy See did it. Even if you act in the name of a cult organization, it can only fool the children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass the order down, and the insect king will catch as many alive as possible. Since they can do such a thing, it's no wonder we retaliate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth often does not need to be so accurate. Anyway, there are only two suspects in total, and it is the same who did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other big forces either have no enmity with the Alpha Kingdom, or need the Alpha Kingdom to be good goalkeepers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no motive to attack the black hand, you can't just jump out to find excitement when you are full, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that creating locust plagues also requires costs. If you want to make noise, at least you have to cultivate a bug king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most locusts only have a lifespan of two or three months. If you want them to be promoted to Warcraft in such a short period of time, the price you need to pay is not a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the bug king is made, this thing is out of control. The intelligent Warcraft and Insect King will not let anyone play around foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a biological instinct to set off a locust plague, but in which direction to release the disaster and when to set off a locust plague, these are all decided by the insect king himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some insect kings even set off an army of locust plagues after being able to cross several countries by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is the Alpha Kingdom that is unlucky now, if it fails to contain the disaster. It is unknown how many countries may be affected in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Planning this kind of action, the probability of lifting a rock and hitting yourself in the foot is not low at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, now, just suspecting that the locust plague was man-made, Caesar III felt that he would also prepare a share for his enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Happiness lies in sharing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locust plague, such a rare thing, how can it be enjoyed by the Alpha Kingdom alone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a mistake in judgment, it doesn't matter. Anyway, it's the enemy who makes trouble, no matter how big the mess is, it's a great event worth celebrating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, you need to be cautious about revenge!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the Holy See, that's all. Anyway, everyone has turned their faces now, even if the Holy See finds out, they will have nothing to do with the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as no evidence is left, all countries in the mainland will also have to see the Holy See deflated. No one will stand on their side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Orc Empire is different. Once the plague of locusts is encountered, it is very likely that the orcs will invade the south in advance, and when the time comes, the kingdom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Grand Duke of Newfoundland could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Counting the days, the new round of orc invasion to the south is about to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Bimeng, that old immortal has passed his 300th birthday, and his youngest son was forcibly supported by him to the position of crown prince.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the situation is very good, and the peace faction firmly holds the upper hand. But how long do you think the old man can live now?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the old guy doesn't die, it's the same if Crown Prince Alex dies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Bimon family is born to be a warlike master. Any young crown prince who takes the position is a representative of the main combat faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Beamon, although he has a high prestige, he is still old after all. The emergence of a crown prince who is in charge of the battle can also break the current balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is true for the Bimon Royal Court, not to mention the other royal families. Everyone couldn't bear it anymore, the day when the orcs invaded the south is not far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether there is a locust plague or not, it will not change this. Instead of waiting to be beaten passively, it is better to cause them some trouble first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least a famine can reduce the number of their vassal races. To save them from always engaging in beast sea tactics, disgusting people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disaster year needs war even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it may sound incomprehensible, politics is such a magic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the locust disaster is not serious, the Alpha Kingdom, which is still accumulating strength, will naturally not make trouble at such a juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the disaster situation expands and even affects the food production in the coming year, then there is no way to go directly to war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asking for help may not necessarily be able to ask for food from various countries. But once the orc empire invaded south, none of the neighbors would dare to say no to food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the most powerful countries in the human world, once the Alpha Kingdom collapses, the probability of the surrounding neighbors blocking the advance of the Orc Empire is also not much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, it will not be a battle of loyalty or interests, but a life-and-death struggle between the human race and the orc race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless races suppressed by the human race may take the opportunity to launch a counterattack. If there is a little carelessness, the position of the continental overlord of the human race will be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is more serious, there is even a risk of genocide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that this is a big gamble. The bet is not only the Alpha Kingdom, but also the fate of the entire human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems a little irrational, but for the Alpha Kingdom, they must participate in such a gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of the gamble that it was able to force the nations of the human race to join the gambling table that the Alpha Kingdom blocked the orcs' centuries-old advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had been weaker and faced the threat of the orcs, if he had cut one city today and lost two cities tomorrow, the Alpha Kingdom would have disappeared in the long river of history long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early the next morning, Hudson, who was sleeping, was awakened by the maid. After a hasty meal, he joined the assembled team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether knights or magicians, all stepped on their horses. Under the leadership of Earl Pierce, they went straight to Arbor County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The feeling of galloping on a horse is really obsessive, even though the kneecap hurts a bit and the **** hurts a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one point Hudson wanted to abandon the horse and ride a bear instead. At least Bear Stearns is stable enough to run without worrying about being jolted down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just seeing everyone riding war horses, even the frail lady magician in legend, at this moment, is showing the demeanor of a female knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, the legends are all lies. Magicians are physically fragile, but compared to knights of the same level, they are still much stronger than ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are fragile magicians, but those weak chickens are not qualified to appear here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is going to exterminate locusts, not for an outing. The kind of mage who casts a few spells and then gets tired of himself is purely a burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor self-esteem made Hudson give up the idea of ​​riding a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are so many people present, and there are not a few who own monsters, and all of them choose to ride war horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The public reason is that the monsters run too aggressively and may disturb the residents along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Noble, when did you pay so much attention to people's livelihood?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said that his knowledge is not enough. Compared with this reason, he is more willing to believe that these guys can't command his monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Highly intelligent creatures, who has no dignity?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you dare to use monsters as coolies, you must be prepared to be beaten to death on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like his own bear, which appearance did he not pay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Insist on fair trade, everyone gets what they need, in order not to repeat the tragedy of that hapless Chi You.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, a horse with a trace of monster blood has greatly enhanced its stamina and explosive power. The distance of hundreds of miles, directly from morning to evening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the Knights, which are all composed of knights, only the Air Force has such a speed. If other troops dared to run so wildly, they would have to toss the soldiers to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the familiar faces who came out to greet him, Hudson felt very cordial, as if he had encountered the warmth of spring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all the way, don't enter a house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Teaming up with a group of cultivators is also a kind of torture for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either you don't open your mouth to speak, and once you do, the topic is basically inseparable from cultivation. Even if we don't directly talk about cultivation, after a while everyone will automatically transfer to the exchange of cultivation experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This made Hudson, an intermediate magician/knight, very injured. Listen to it, I don't understand it myself, and it's easy to be led astray by these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially some weird ideas are simply constantly challenging Hudson's cognitive limits. If you accidentally get limped by fools and follow the train of thought they discussed, no one knows what will happen next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these guys keep claiming that it is their original cultivation method, and that they have the current strength because of using these methods; but Hudson firmly believes that these are all nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without relatives or relatives, who would be foolish to hand over his cultivation method? This is the ability to eat and pass on to the family, even the disciples may not be able to pass it on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the details are explained so clearly, it is clear that they want to fool the mice to practice and provide them with data reference.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't follow along, but these voices kept reappearing in his ears. It made Hudson think for a while that these guys wanted to plot him and set him up on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only after seeing Earl Pierce with the same depressed expression that Hudson abandoned this idea. The indiscriminate attack is clearly intended to fool all the talented juniors into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect is naturally not very good. Geniuses, none of them are fools. How could he be a guinea pig for others if he hadn't finished learning his own inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is so stupid, he deserves to die. At least he was fooled to death now, and he was the only one who died. In case of being fooled in the future, it will be unlucky for the whole family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting old friends should have been something worth celebrating. But now that the locust plague is about to break out, everyone is really not happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to recharge your batteries, the welcome banquet was skipped. All activities are kept simple, even the old friends I met before did not come over to catch up at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is undoubtedly a wise decision. After a day of tossing, my body is about to fall apart. That's true for Hudson, and it's not much better for anyone else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong are strong-willed and able to endure the unbearable pain of ordinary people, but it does not mean that everyone will not be tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arriving in the county does not mean that the task is completed. Tomorrow, we will go out to intercept the army of locusts. In order to reduce losses, it is inevitable to go deep into neighboring provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, the Governor's Office has come forward to communicate, and it is not Hudson's turn to worry about it. Now you just need to be ready for battle, and don't hold back if you encounter an army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for fighting, that's the bear's business. Most of Hudson's combat power is in bows and arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are people who shoot big eagles with a bow, but who has ever seen one shoot locusts with a bow?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no banquet, but small meetings are still indispensable. As the master of the main force, Hudson is very honored to be present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation has changed. I just received a magical message from the capital. There is a possibility of man-made control of this locust plague. Let us meet the insect king to catch as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reinforcements are on their way, but don't get your hopes up too much. Our task is to find the insect king from the army of locusts. The element of luck is more important than a few masters. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a fact. The locust army is actually not a big threat to everyone present. In all previous locust plagues, it was rare to hear that a master was killed in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson clearly felt that everyone's eyes were on him. His intuition told him that these guys entrusted him, the \"son of luck\", with the task of finding the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hudson suddenly understood why he was so valued. In addition to being able to beat the bear in love, everyone also took a fancy to his luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of the human setting broke out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Legendary things happened to him too much. Although most of the stories are made legendary after artistic processing, but there are many coincidences, and everyone can't help but believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, this kind of \"luck\" character design is the easiest to frighten people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extraordinary is a last resort, no one wants to confront the \"Child of Luck\". Historical experience tells everyone that head-to-head confrontation with the son of luck usually does not lead to any good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoying the dividends brought by the \"personal design\", you must bear the corresponding backlash. Fortunately, this time I was only looking for the insect king, so the safety was guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Locusts, that kind of little bean diced. Even if it is promoted to Warcraft, its combat effectiveness is still at the bottom of Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the insect king was flying fast and could command the army of locusts to fight, his meager combat power would not have been taken seriously by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, if the locust plague is controlled by people, is the king of insects also controlled by people?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An insect king under human control, as long as it is willing to hide. It can completely avoid our eyes and ears, act like an ordinary locust, and sneak into my southeastern province from any corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult for ordinary magicians to distinguish the difference between the insect king and the locust, let alone ordinary people. This will inevitably increase the difficulty of finding out the insect king. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson decisively resorted to the method of dumping the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the capital said that the locust plague may be controlled by humans, it would be easy to explain why we didn't meet the king of insects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Baron Hudson. The worm king is not so easy to control, and monsters have their own dignity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are forced to sign a master-servant contract, they cannot be made to cooperate sincerely. Even the bug king may take the initiative to expose the identity of the controller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, we just need to strictly arm ourselves. Believe that the great Lord of Dawn will bless his followers, and will never let the plague of locusts continue! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce replied formulaically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all correct nonsense, even the person who blamed the blame has been selected. If you can't catch the insect king, it's because the Lord of Dawn is not protecting you, and it's not because he, the governor, is not working hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Fengyun Province, locust plagues swept across the land, immature wheat, soybeans... all entered the stomachs of these demons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are not enough. It seemed that the army of locusts, who could never get enough to eat, not only devoured the crops, but even the weeds and leaves in the fields did not escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locusts devoured everything that could be swallowed, and the army passed through the border, as if the whole world had fallen into dead silence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After avoiding the front of the locust army, the noble lords organized serfs to hunt down the remaining locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sparse army of insect catchers, on the disheveled face, is full of despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The disaster year is coming!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elder farmers with a little bit of experience know that in such a catastrophic year, it is the greatest luck not to starve to death. Wanting to have a full meal is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no surprises, and the nobles issued orders to reduce rations one after another. Not only did the food standards of the serfs decline, but the food standards of many minor nobles themselves were also forced to decline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the broth is served at this moment, meat grains can still be seen vaguely, and everyone looks at the food in the bowl, still not the slightest joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locusts devoured everything, and there was not enough fodder on the ground, so the noble lord could only reluctantly slaughter the animals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eating a good meal now means that you will need to endure longer years of hunger in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the food, you can tell that rye is temporarily withdrawn from the staple food, and everyone eats everything they eat in advance, and it is difficult to preserve miscellaneous grains for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this depressed world, a special caravan is constantly shuttling through the fields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main business of the caravan is: to buy livestock slaughtered by the nobles, pickle them, and transport them to big cities for sale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a genius idea, most people would definitely not be able to think of it. Other caravans only buy fur, but they don't even spare meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An exclusive sale does not mean a profitable sale. Unless it is a nobleman, there are probably very few ordinary people who can enjoy marinated meat products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in this catastrophic year, everyone who has money will only give priority to purchasing food instead of luxury meat products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    None of these will affect the old man's decision, because even if his business does not make money, he has never lost money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how **** the product is, in the end there will always be people who take advantage of it and buy it at a price that exceeds the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, these locusts are eating wood!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking in this oppressive world, the innocent voice of the little girl became the source of joy in the caravan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone is really not happy this time. Locusts eating wood is definitely not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the locusts have evolved this ability, the disaster will be even more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe when I woke up, the carriage disappeared. For the caravan walking in the disaster area, it is definitely a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Guna is amazing, you discovered all of this. But these locusts are not good things, if you encounter them, you will be trampled to death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the old man kicked up a pile of gravel and flew out, killing all the locusts in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accompanying buddies are also busy, constantly checking whether there are locusts mixed into the convoy. Once discovered, immediately take thunder measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Grandpa, you are lying! Last time I saw...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the little girl could finish speaking, the master covered her little mouth and said patiently: \"Little girl, don't talk nonsense!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These locusts have mutated and are highly poisonous! If you want to eat meat, grandpa will cook it for you, but don't be greedy...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl looked at the old man with an aggrieved face. When is she going to eat locusts? It's clearly...\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

As if some taboo had been touched, the old man couldn't even take care of business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it has something to do with these businesses not making money, and it has nothing to do with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the old man's business vision is as accurate as ever. Being able to maintain a balance of payments depends on \"luck\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his own words:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The big money-making business has long been taken over by big shots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary people who want to get involved in it will only invite disaster for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earn some hard money and be safe and sound, that's the most important thing. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As night fell, the old man who left the convoy instantly changed his image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old skin became rounded, and the wrinkles on the face gradually disappeared, as if suddenly 30 years younger\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, we have completed the task you ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locusts were lured and dispersed, and they were sprinkled all the way to the southeastern province according to your instructions. At this moment, the army of locusts is continuously gathering there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the group of nobles reacted quickly, and now they have arrived in Arbor County, and it seems that they are going to hunt the insect king halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of this noble team is very strong. The magisters and earth knights, who are rarely seen in the world, have appeared now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be boldly guessed that the high-end combat power of the entire southeastern province has been gathered at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magicians who participated in the operation are the least powerful and are also senior magicians. The strength of the knights is also the big knights, and these guys also carry monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the cooperation of the army organized by the local nobles in Qiaomu County, no one can say whether the insect king can break through the blockade. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged man reported anxiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Witnessing the background of the nobility with his own eyes, the arrogance of the middle-aged man has long since disappeared without a trace. If it weren't for this locust plague, maybe I wouldn't have had the chance to see it in my life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Skull and Bones' small fights are simply not enough to make people go all out. Just the power put on the bright side can suppress them countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Karliss, don't be fooled by temporary success or failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you succeed, or you fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not our fight, and the nobles are not our real enemies. Their strength is strong, which is a good thing for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a transaction, the locust plague has reached this point, it is enough for those **** to go back and ask for rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the insect king fails to enter the southeastern province, the scattered locust army alone is enough to achieve our goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sights of the nobles are distracted, and they won't be able to trouble us in the short term. Your next task is to find the Horn of the Blood Moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadeer City was the last place where the Blood Moon Horn appeared, and the nobles who entered the city last year to suppress the rebellion were all suspected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is the best opportunity to act, you must keep a low profile, and don't cause trouble until you find the Blood Moon Horn. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An anti-Holy See organization is lurking in the ranks supported by the Holy See. It has to be said that it is a kind of irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more dangerous the place, the safer it is. Against the Skull and Bones' anti-armor, it covers up all reasonable and unreasonable actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cult organizations, they never act according to the rules. No one will find it strange to change the style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks suspicious, it's just normal operation. If there is no problem, is it still a cult organization?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, we have done things so cleanly, why don't we leave a trace and let the nobles and the Holy See dogs bite the dogs?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To stir up conflicts between the Holy See and the aristocratic group, this is the plan they all dream of accomplishing. But when the opportunity presented itself, the Skeleton Lord in front of him did the opposite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did not expose the existence of the Holy See, but even deliberately washed away the man-made traces and concealed it as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Karliss, your thinking is too simple. Although the Holy See is corrupt, it doesn't mean that those guys are really stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deliberately leaving traces, isn't it exposing us to their eyes?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the time to fall out. We cannot do without the support of the Holy See until we get the support of new big forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if no trace is left, those nobles will still find the Holy See. Evidence has never been a problem for big forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just doubts are enough to make them draw conclusions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last time, didn't you suffer a loss? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of the Skeleton Lord embarrass Karlis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only those who work in the middle and lower levels regard evidence and clues as important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being carried away by one's own cognition, and bringing one's own ideas into other people's decision-making, how can one not suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arbor County, after a simple regional division, several bigwigs led their own people to take charge of an area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each team is evenly distributed, with magicians, knights, and local noble private troops who came to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really just cooperation, the noble private army who pulls the net to catch locusts, the main task is to report the trace of the insect king immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hunting?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how weak a monster is, it is still a monster, and it is not something ordinary people can deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, creatures like the insect king can fly so fast that even the fastest horses can't catch up, let alone ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the youngest team leader, no matter where he goes, Hudson has the highest return rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is conceivable that after experiencing this wave, he will become a \"child of other people's family\" in the eyes of more parents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at all kinds of equipment to deal with locusts, although the tools are a bit crude, they are generally experienced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to various nets, what Hudson likes the most is the prepared smoke. Thick smoke to drive away locusts should be the most effective means for ordinary people under the existing technological means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magicians are not counted. Although I don't know how to use all kinds of magic devices, my intuition tells Hudson that these inconspicuous gadgets must be quite lethal to locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to physical means, there are also locust repellent potions made by alchemists temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Efficacy is similar to that of insecticide, and it works well on small swarms of locusts. Once it encounters an army of locusts commanded by the insect king, it loses its effect instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also very confused in this regard, as if the insect king has a unique talent. The locusts driven by it will not only increase their drug resistance, but even their combat effectiveness will increase dramatically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an insect emperor, the situation will be even worse. I heard that under the command of the insect emperor, these vegetarian locusts would not spare even meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the worm emperor is born, all the people and animals will be extinct, and very few creatures can survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, he is the team leader, but in fact, Hudson doesn't need to direct anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the strong men participating in this operation have their own areas of responsibility, and the magician is also equipped with knight protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble private army that came to cooperate was naturally commanded by the noble lord himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander in name, the main task is to rush to capture alive or kill the insect king immediately after discovering it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to improve efficiency, there are two Griffon cavalry who take turns to patrol the sky with Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose a small stream to stop, Hudson, who was bored, quietly watched Bear Stearns playing in the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bear child is at the most curious stage of his life, and everything he sees feels fresh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Catch crabs for a while, catch fish and shrimps for a while, and show off to Hudson from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to let the little guy work harder, Hudson directly turned into an enthusiastic big brother, constantly affirming the bear boy's record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Om, um...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of flapping wings sounded, and Hudson's expression suddenly became serious, and he finally came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the efforts of the magician, the rising thick black smoke seemed to have long legs, and went directly towards the army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He reached out and patted the cub on the shoulder, Hudson said with a smile:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, time to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Get me all these nasty little bugs, but don't hurt your own people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who was disturbed, rolled his black eyes, waved his bear paw and slapped the ground, causing the whole earth to tremble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This guy was definitely intentional. Before he could blame Bear Stearns for doing something wrong, he heard the voice of \"Shu Shua...\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the cub as the center, wherever Hudson could see, locusts kept falling from the sky as if they were drunk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Gravity Field?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he did feel that his body was a little heavier, but this increase was not large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serf soldiers pulling nets nearby to catch locusts were not affected either. If it weren't for the locusts falling constantly, Hudson would have almost ignored the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a small power does not match the name of \"gravity field\" at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seemingly aware of his thoughts, Bear Stearns said angrily: \"Is it worth using all your strength to deal with a group of small bugs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, there is still your contract partner. In case you are accidentally squeezed into a meat paste, who will take care of me...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seemingly aware of a slip of the tongue, Bear Stearns swallowed back the words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bragging, that's all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the long-term meal ticket is stimulated, and then gnaw on the black and hard iron lump bread, that is not the life of a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not so easy to find a partner who can take care of food and help it improve its strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for being a little weaker, in other respects, Hudson's partner fully meets the requirements of the Bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop talking nonsense here, who doesn't know what kind of bear you are? There are still many annoying bugs, follow me to patrol the defense zone.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson was already on the bear's back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he has long been immune to Bear Stearns' bragging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, Bear Stearns has indeed awakened all the innate abilities of the Earth Bear. It's just power, it's hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the field of gravity, if the range of application is compressed within a few meters, it may be possible to take Hudson away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the scope of the display is expanded, it is not bad to be able to drop the locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, Hudson saw many bugs fall to the ground, struggled again, and then fell again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be solved in one go, with this guy's pretentious style, this situation will never happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is enough to bring down the locusts. Occasionally there is a fish that slips through the net, and it doesn't hurt too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is only one Earth Bear, there must be dozens of them. Put it in front of the locust army, and keep it safe that no locust can leave alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Riding on the back of Bear Stearns' bear, patrolling his own defense area all the way, the locust army landed one after another along the way, and one person and one bear instantly became the most beautiful scenery on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a preliminary estimate, the range of Bear Stearns' gravity domain was affected, but the result surprised Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within a radius of one mile, not a single locust can fly. Most of the locusts, after suffering a sudden heavy blow, ended their life with two thumps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one life is recovered, it will soon be replaced by the army of serfs. The arrangement is clear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going further, the thin locusts will fall down, while the strong locusts can still stand firm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, the closer the locust is to the cub, the more miserable it is. It takes roughly two or three miles to get rid of the influence of the gravity field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brilliant record made Hudson want to ride a cub for a stroll among the locust army. Just by closing and releasing the gravity domain, and tossing and turning several times, the locusts in the area covered by the domain can be strangled seven or eight times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of insecticidal efficiency, this is more efficient and environmentally friendly than any pesticide. No matter how large the locust army is, it can be tossed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just remembering the purpose of this time, Hudson finally suppressed this tempting idea. After such a toss, the locust army dispersed, but the culprit, the insect king, also slipped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a race like locusts, whose reproduction speed is against the sky, as long as there is one insect king left, it won't be long before there will be another army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Become the insect king of Warcraft, but the life span and wisdom are double increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let them live in the world for a while longer, and their IQ level may be able to catch up with humans. At that time, it will be even more difficult to deal with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the tossing time is long, the insect king who has absorbed a lot of disaster energy will have a chance to advance to become the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has developed to the stage of the insect emperor, and the destructive power of the locust army has reached the level of destruction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way to deal with it is to find the insect king and immediately use thunder to kill it, so as not to give it a chance to set off a plague of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, the locust army has formed a large scale, and it is even more important to kill the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the news from the Governor's Mansion, there are slightly more insect kings in this locust plague. Many worm kings were hunted and killed in several neighboring provinces, but the army of worms still did not disperse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the capital has ordered to catch as many alive as possible. Obviously, there are more stories behind this locust plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't want to get angry, didn't dare to destroy the bug-catching plan of the big shots at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locust extermination war is still going on, and it's not just the Earth Bear who stands out on the battlefield. Although other monsters are not so easy, they also brought wonderful performances to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's flame lion is equivalent to the saliva of magma, and when it is sprayed out, it is a flamethrower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flames tens of meters long, and the aroma emitted by the roasted locusts can float for several miles. Seeing the army of serfs, it was drooling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the noble lord who witnessed all this repeatedly emphasized: locusts cannot be eaten. Guessing about these guys, I couldn't help but taste them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magician Yuli who disliked Hudson the most also killed all sides on the battlefield. Not only is there a magic circle specifically for locusts, but the performance of his Warcraft mount is also surprising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone plugged their ears, their scalps were still numb from the weird cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Sound Beast\", which specializes in making noise, has the most powerful talent and supernatural power to make noise, and the strongest attack technique is also noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is famous throughout the continent of Aslant for making a lot of noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most fair evaluation given by the outside world on the cry of the \"Cracking Sound Beast\" is: Those who hear it can't wait to skin it;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is it notorious in the human world, but it is also disgusted by beasts and beasts in World of Warcraft. The specific manifestation is: after hearing the cry of the crackling beast from afar, Bear Stearns wanted to go over and hammer it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This move was approved by Hudson, but in the end he restrained his emotions. After all, they are still teammates now, and they can't kill each other, making the locust see a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that there are quite a few monsters with similar performances. Who made this guy amplify his moves and entertain them regardless of enemy or friend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A pit is a pit, but the power of the sound wave skill is really powerful. Anyway, after coming here all of a sudden, the dense army of locusts in Hudson's sight disappeared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most legendary thing is that two insect king warriors rushed out of the locust army, and ran directly to a duel with the \"Sound Beast\". The result was naturally to help the aristocratic camp achieve zero breakthroughs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy is dizzy with anger, and the power of the noise attack can be imagined. Regrettably, killing one thousand enemies also cost five hundred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the serfs who fell to the ground and wailed loudly, even a determined man like Hudson kept rubbing his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still a colleague who is far away from the two sides and close to each other, and they don't know how miserable they were.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone insists on going his own way and declines the reminder to plug his ears, he probably feels absolutely sour now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, it is really a miracle that such a hated monster has not been exterminated until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson understands Magister Yuli a little bit. It is understandable to deal with such monsters every day, and to be tossed out of mental illness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Afraid of comparison in everything, seeing a crowd of otherworldly monsters vying to make their debut, Hudson suddenly felt that Bear Stearns was really good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I'm a little bit lazy, a little bragging, rude and uneducated... But overall it's tolerable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was replaced by the Cracked Beast, Hudson couldn't guarantee that he would kill it if he suddenly made such a voice when he was in a bad mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the ultimate move of \"Sound Beast\" is limited. After doing this, he needs to rest for a few days. Otherwise, let it continue to toss, Hudson is very afraid that he will not be able to help running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The black dots that appeared in the sky pulled Hudson back from his wild thoughts. I have to admit that the locust army is determined, and dare to continue after being so tossed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they were in a normal army and knew that the front was so scary, they would have already scattered and fled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, you have seen the worm king. Pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally coming out, I can't let others take all the credit. If it gets out, it will also disgrace your Earth Bear clan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson worked hard to encourage the bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Bear Stearns didn't buy it. Instead, he turned his head to look at him, and stretched out a huge bear paw as a gesture—to share the bill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too high an IQ is not a good thing at first sight. Bear Stearns is not so good at clearing accounts. In order not to be cheated, he even learned to read the books.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the distance, Hudson spread his hands and said: \"Don't worry, two ones add five. We will split all the profits in half, and we will never treat you badly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the immobile bear paw, he knew this plan, but the cub didn't approve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own bear is getting harder and harder to cheat. Hudson was very helpless, who would have thought that this lazy guy would grow his wisdom so fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, the one thousand gold coin reward is also yours. Don't rush to refuse, although you will do the most to catch the insect king next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this deal, but I came forward to follow. For the follow-up rewards, I have to come forward to negotiate with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each bug king allows you to get an extra thousand gold coins, which is already interesting enough. If I ask for more, wouldn't I be busy in vain?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, one thousand gold coins can buy hundreds of sheep, which can produce milk every day...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing that cannot be linked to animal milk. Once the unit of measurement is changed, the brain circuit of the cub will change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is no exception. Bear Stearns, who began to calculate how many sheep and cows he could exchange, quickly retracted his bear paws, turned his head, and focused his gaze on the army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fiery eyes make people afraid. It was as if what it saw at the moment was not an army of locusts, but pots of animal milk with honey.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The violent friction with the air forced Hudson to deal with it carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he is still a magician, so he added a magic shield to himself in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The charging speed is too fast, far exceeding the falling speed of locusts. Had Hudson reacted a little slower, close contact with locusts would have been inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the rough skin and thick flesh of our own bears, they have no feeling for these little ones. His little face was in close contact with locusts, and the consequences were unimaginable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance of a few miles, the destination is reached in an instant, this bear speed is simply flying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, there is nothing wrong with talking about flying. Except for the four-legged kick in the initial stage, Bear Stearns' short legs basically never touched the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the middle of the journey, several big bare trees were even broken. The outstretched branches of the big trees almost pierced Hudson's magic shield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of the pit master, this guy is definitely a professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to deliberately target, just instinctive habits can kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is also the reason why people who own monster mounts in the Aslante continent are all strong. A guy with poor strength can't bear the talent attribute of his own monster instinct to pit his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could get used to the speedy \"bear\", Bear Stearns suddenly turned around and went straight to the left. The thrilling sharp turn made him almost throw up on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before crossing, I didn't get carsick. I didn't expect that after crossing, I would faint “bear” because of the speed of the mount, which made Hudson furious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not in front of the line of sight, a huge locust can be vaguely seen, fleeing in a hurry, he has to...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    never mind!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The occasion is not right now, people are on the back of a bear, and they are not tough in speaking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected, after experiencing a high-speed \"bear\" and a sharp turn, what greeted him was another sudden brake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The huge inertial force made Hudson firmly grasp the bear's hair, and put his body on the bear's back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he understood what was going on, Bear Stearns lifted the stunned Bug King into the bear's paw, showing off his achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, with just that one slap, the mighty bug king rushed straight to the street.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hudson suddenly understood why there had never been a locust plague in the Warcraft Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A minor Earth Bear, it's as simple as picking up a Bug King. The number of high-level monsters in the entire Warcraft Mountain Range is unknown, and there are not enough insect kings and insect kings to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the army of locusts swept across the gathering place of monsters, it would be giving them extra food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The locust army is poisonous, and it is only for ordinary people. With the physical fitness of a monster, I'm afraid I don't even feel the toxin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, what the **** are you doing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why didn't you remind me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you know how dangerous it was just now, it's almost...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson finished speaking, the cub imitated his usual tone and replied: \"Calm down!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a trivial matter is so frizzy, how can it become a big weapon?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't bear a little bit of suffering, but I have the nerve to complain here, it's just embarrassing me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have a thick skin when it comes to danger. From the beginning to the end, you are watching the play from the sidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others are fighting together with Warcraft. You follow Benxiong to claim credit, and you have to cover you along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for taking care of you, I would have finished work long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, I am unlucky to meet you as a combat partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    if only…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being hated by a bear first, Hudson, who was speechless, immediately began to doubt life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't this idiot sleeping all the time, why did he secretly learn all these routines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that he must avoid this guy when dealing with official business in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if a bear who can play politics is cultivated, God knows what will happen in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, Bear Stearns! You did it on purpose!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bears of the earth have always been known for their honesty and honesty. How could you, a rogue bear, appear? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a bit far-fetched to say that the cub did it on purpose just now. If you really want to cheat him, just a magic shield is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just looking at the arrogant look of this guy, Hudson is full of anger. Looking at the joke of his master, it is simply...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, don't care so much about a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that there is no way to care about it. After throwing the worm king to Hudson, Bear Stearns once again aimed at a new target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bear knight, Hudson's heart is broken. The speed of the Earth Bear at full strength is too fast, just like driving a supersonic motorcycle, it feels like going to heaven.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the cub has gained experience this time, and before taking action, he knew to bless him with the magic of the guardian of the earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally stabilized. Don't worry about being thrown out at any time, and Hudson, who doesn't have to worry about \"Bear\" vomiting too fast, finally has the mind to play \"Bear Bear\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among hundreds of millions of locusts, if you enter a land without insects, the feeling is a stimulus. The hurricane speed made Hudson, who has become more adaptable, sublimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One person and one bear having fun, kept shuttling through the swarm of insects, making a bad start for everyone. Soon everyone followed suit and even ignored the defense zone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching a group of strong men tossing about in the army of locusts, Earl Pierce's heart was broken. They are all a group of uncles, and his face as the governor is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gradually, he realized that something was wrong. Although the army of locusts, which was attacked by a group of strong men, was in disintegration, the ultimate goal was still the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, the locust army gathered together, they just need to block the way of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the army of locusts is scattered, and the range of activities is also expanding; the number of locusts breaking through from weak areas is also increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Someone moved their hands and feet to deliberately lure the locusts to the southeast province!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this thought came, Earl Pierce couldn't get it out of his mind. Fortunately, he reacted quickly enough in this wave, and in the shortest possible time, he invited all the strong men who could be pulled out from the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you learn from the neighbors next door and organize experts to hunt and kill locusts after the locusts flood, you will be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that I don't know which force my family has offended, and I want to make trouble for the Dalton family at all costs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The medicine to lure locusts is not cheap. The continuous influx of such a large-scale army of locusts is purely paving the way for locusts with gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spontaneously taking the blame, it's not that Earl Pierce is out of his mind. It is precisely because of too much brain that he came to this conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many nobles and nobles in the southeastern province, the Dalton family is the only one who is qualified to offend one big power and make the other party helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to know, the scale of the locust army is too large. To be able to get rid of the Insect King, it will take a lot of effort. It is almost impossible to kill all the locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous areas, preparations to fight against the locust plague are being carried out in an orderly manner. The grain that could be harvested was harvested in advance. The rest is really useless, so we can only bear the plague of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tens of thousands of people prepared for the battle together without any panic. The importance of talent has to be acknowledged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it had been put beforehand, if Master Hudson hadn't been there, the territory would have been messed up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The method is nothing new, it is all manual capture + smoky. The high-end method of exterminating locusts within the magic potion is not yet mastered by the mountain leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surrounding territories are generally similar. All the lords are preparing for battle, though most know that these primitive means are not very effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The work to combat the locust plague still needs to be carried out. It doesn't matter how many locusts are killed, the key is to put on a good posture and strengthen the confidence of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more catastrophic the year, the more need to appease the people. The cult organizations lurking in various places have long been unwilling to be lonely, and are waiting for an opportunity to launch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two counties of Wright and Wyton, which have suffered a lot from the war, are doing pretty well this time. The top and bottom have been cleaned up, and the big and small cult organizations are basically finished in the last turmoil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic lords who ruled the two counties, except for the uneven ability to inherit the family business, most of the lords did not lack means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luoye Town, went to the Governor's Mansion to sign up to fight against the locust plague, but was persuaded to leave by his uncle on the grounds that his strength was too poor, which made Baron Cayo very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, not many people know about this matter, and Baron Cayo was able to block the news in time, otherwise he will be humiliated if it spreads out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The strength is not enough\", this evaluation is too hurtful. Originally thought that his strength was not bad among the younger generation, but the reality was very embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that talent cannot be forced. Even if a large amount of resources are spent, Baron Cayo can only catch up with the average level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suppressed with anger, naturally need to find a place to vent. Baron Cayo naturally stared at his neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Young master, this locust plague is coming in a terrible way. According to the news from the Governor's Mansion, it is inevitable that it will spread to the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the available information, even if we don't need to do anything, the locust plague will affect Wyton and Wright counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the medicine is used, it will undoubtedly make the disaster worse. If they only put medicines in a few of their territories, it is very likely that people will see the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any trace of this kind of thing reveals, and we are likely to be suspected. On the contrary, revealing the slightest flaw will be a fatal blow to your reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, putting things into adjacent areas can also achieve the effect, and people will not suspect us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old housekeeper tried his best to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep down, he was against it. Although these potions were prepared by Baron Cayo himself, not many people know about them. But there is no impenetrable wall in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the news leaks out, maybe the nobles in the whole province will remember the locust plague on his head. If the matter develops to that point, even the Dalton family can't stop it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Fu. I'm not that stupid. This kind of thing naturally requires a blame man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The work of looting in the territory has ended, and even if I lose all the rest, I can afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply come to a wave of bitter tricks, temporarily wronged the local nobles, and give this pot to the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the power of these potions, no matter where they are thrown, they will be affected within a hundred miles, and no one can escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for an unexpected harvest, I wouldn't be able to prepare it. This time is the best opportunity, once you miss it, it will be difficult to control the two counties. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is nothing to be cruel to others, the key is to be able to be cruel to yourself. Even his own territory was not spared. If it was said that he poisoned it, no one would believe it if it spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, with the news of the locust plague, this city, which had just recovered a bit of prosperity, fell into depression again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grain store controlled by the Lord's Mansion has begun to limit the supply per person per day, and the price has soared to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high cost of living has made countless merchants passively choose to move. Baron Sith was also very helpless. What he bought was high-priced food, and there was no room for price reduction at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that after the disaster, the nearby noble lords tightened their belts and suspended all unnecessary expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various entertainment venues are all closed. All kinds of luxury goods and optional consumer goods also lost their market overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the best-selling commodities are grain and cloth, followed by salt, and iron products and agricultural tools can also be sold. There are more sellers than buyers for other non-necessary commodities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not making money is a trivial matter, the key is that you have to lose money to open the door. Businessmen are best at looking at the pros and cons. After assessing the risk-resistance capabilities of the local nobles and lords, they quickly came to a bad conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't leave while the order is still there. When the locust plague sweeps over, the food shortage breaks out, and “bandits and bandits” are everywhere, you won't be able to run away even if you want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is worried that if they really can't live on, Master Sith, who seems to be kind now, will be the first to raise his butcher's knife against them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prejudice is so serious, even though Baron Sith has been doing a good job, everyone's prejudice against the nobles of the Northland has long been formed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After crushing a flying grasshopper to death, Baron Sith asked rather unwillingly: \"Ferren, do you think this plague of locusts is really unavoidable?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of painstaking efforts, no one is willing to give up, but in the face of natural disasters, manpower is too slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, these scattered grasshoppers are not a threat now. But once these inconspicuous little things gather into an army, it will be the most terrifying disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is more worrying is that this locust plague has man-made signs behind it. This makes it more difficult to suppress the disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is planning for the worst, and some territories have begun to deliberately reduce the number of orc slaves to reduce food consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous territory you are most concerned about has already caught grasshoppers in the territory and dried them for storage. It is said that it is for feeding livestock, but I think it is mostly for orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the locust plague strikes, due to the pressure of food, the mountain baron may only be able to artificially reduce the number of orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the lords issued orders prohibiting male and female serfs from marrying and having intercourse. These are all preparations for the food shortage that may come next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reaction of the local nobles is so fierce, let alone us outsiders. Several nearby provinces have also suffered locust plagues, and even if they want to buy food from the outside world, they can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have come to this point, and we have to prepare for the worst. If the merchants want to leave, let them go, just to reduce some food consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave a little incense, and invite them back when the disaster is over. With this wave of experience, their confidence in the territory can also be strengthened in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun tried to persuade him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the year of catastrophe, increase income and reduce expenditure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the premise is that there must be enough food reserves. Sorry about Dardir's reserves, that's seriously lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if all these tasks are done. It is still difficult to support the next spring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase food reserves, countless nobles organized their men to hunt in the mountains and forests. All kinds of wild animals, this wave also suffered a catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including wild vegetables into grain reserves can only be regarded as a routine operation. Some kind of calculating lord, even the bark and grass roots are counted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's gradually reduce the number of slaves, and try to make them as normal as possible, so as not to spread the word and affect their reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything that can be sold inside is sold. Including those dancers, they were all disposed of while they were still worth a little money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, the ration supply of all the citizens who do not work will be reduced by 20% again. Keep only the most basic survival materials, and you will be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mobilize all the personal connections we secretly manage, purchase as much food as possible, and count as much as you can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to keep an eye on the movements of the big grain merchants, and make a no-cost deal if you have the opportunity. At this point, there is no need to install it anymore. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that he doesn't care about the terrible consequences that may be caused by this order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, master!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler responded, without any intention of admonishing him. Indifference, determination, ruthlessness... are also good qualities of nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get better in this highly competitive world, you must abandon all the heart of the Virgin, and face this cruel world with the most rational attitude.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Arbor County, the nobles who successfully blocked the locust army were not elated. Instead, worry about the continuous army of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Manpower has a limit after all, and the strong will also be exhausted. The few top powerhouses who had just started fighting hard, have now been replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just returned to the camp, Hudson became the brightest cub again. For no other reason, the insect king was hung all over his body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Solving the five insect kings alone, and all of them were captured alive, this record is almost catching up with the sum of all the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the temptation of animal milk and honey is too great. If Hudson hadn't pulled him, Bear Stearns still doesn't want to come back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bears can stand it, but people can't stand it. After tossing for so long, Hudson's whole body was about to fall apart, and he had to force Bear Stearns to call it a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that the insect king is not easy to catch at this time. Even if someone slipped through the net, they all hid far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intelligent creatures will not know that there is danger ahead, but foolishly go to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army of locusts that originally converged into one group is now dispersed into several groups, which is the best proof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although gathering together is beneficial for their promotion, but in front of life, life is more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The target of the locusts is very clear, that is, our southeastern province, even if forced to detour, there is no destination. It is now certain that someone has released locust traps in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, you shot and dispersed the locust army. Cut off the possibility of the birth of the Zonghuang, otherwise this disaster will really get out of control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who the thief is is temporarily uncertain. We can only keep this account in mind first, and settle it with them when we find out in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, I can only ask you to make persistent efforts to get rid of all the remaining insect kings. The kingdom will never forget everyone's achievements. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Earl Pierce is really tired. Even the daily polite words were omitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson feels that this is also related to the fact that everyone present is not easy to fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to draw a big pie, but it is difficult to realize the big pie. However, these strong people are easy to admit death, and if they dare to speak out, they will dare to beat the governor's sap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than asking for trouble by playing tricks, it is better to be sincere, and it is easier to gain everyone's favor.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In order to catch up with the swarm, Hudson had to \"beat the bear\" again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information provided by the Griffin Cavalry, they ran all the way for eighty miles before intercepting a swarm of insects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pitfall was that the insect king was not found inside, so Bear Stearns' eyes glowed red with anger, and he drove the gravity field, constantly interspersing among the insect swarms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how Hudson tried to persuade him, it was useless until the swarm fled in all directions, and then he gave up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the dead locusts, Hudson showed no mercy at all. It's because they are short-lived, they are tossing and tossing without sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it good to stay in Arbor County for a decisive battle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was a sleepless attack, Hudson recognized it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, if Xiong persisted, he would not be cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big deal is to sleep directly on the back of the bear, with the magic blessing of the guardian of the earth, the safety is still guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scattered insect swarms are now flooding the southeast province, and each team is far apart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance is several miles away, and the distance is hundreds of miles, which greatly increases the difficulty of hunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most embarrassing thing is that after running a hundred and eighty miles, he caught up with the insect swarm, but he couldn't find the shadow of the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a waste of time to work, and then I can only look for the next swarm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this situation, Hudson was well prepared. Yesterday, more than a dozen worm kings were captured and killed, and there were very few worm kings left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether these intelligent creatures dare to enter the southeastern province is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a potion to lure locusts, the attraction is no longer so fatal to a life like the insect king who has been promoted to a monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the Governor's Mansion doesn't need to bother, just throw locust-attracting potions all over the place to lure them to their door and die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just attracting ordinary locusts will not help the overall situation, and it is not economically desirable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the scope of influence of the potion is limited, but the reproduction speed of locusts is infinite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, a female locust lays dozens of eggs at a time, which can hatch in just twenty days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once the insect king appears, this speed can be further catalyzed. Not only has the spawning speed doubled, but even the hatching time has been shortened to two days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the insect king is not killed, an army of hundreds of billions of locusts can be pulled out in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that the speed of trapping and killing locusts may not necessarily be able to catch up with their reproduction speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After two full days of busy work, I only harvested one insect king. Such a speed is unacceptable not only for Bear Stearns, but also for Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they can't stand it, not only them, but the situation of other strong people from all walks of life is not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Highly exhausted battles, but not in exchange for the desired gains, everyone's enthusiasm has been hit hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the plague of locusts has spread and spread to their own territory, everyone can no longer bear it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the first representative left, the rest followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The insect king is to be caught, but the most urgent thing is to take care of yourself first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you find the trace of the insect king, you can ask for help from the nearest one. For the sake of generous rewards, everyone will not be stingy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was no exception, and decisively resigned from Governor Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of rewards, in addition to rewarding the King of Insects with gold coins to be cashed out, everyone else needs to be slowly blended in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing is not in a hurry. After the locust plague is extinguished, it will be too late to discuss slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, this operation exceeded expectations. For capturing eight insect kings alive, the reward on the bright side is 8,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resources that can be exchanged secretly will only be more than this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially \"catch the living\" is the order of Caesar III. With this style of behavior, it is unlikely that everyone will do it for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific rewards are unknown, but there must be rewards anyway. Otherwise, Caesar III's reputation in the middle and lower aristocratic circles would not be as good as it is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he stepped into Wright County, Hudson noticed something was wrong. Even though it was in the southernmost part of the province, the locust plague was actually worse than other areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the locust army was severely injured by the masters of the Governor's Mansion, and the scattered swarms were hunted and killed by the noble lords along the way. It stands to reason that there will be fewer people entering the rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring the need to investigate the cause, one person and one bear accelerated the speed of travel. As for the locusts along the way, they were naturally disposed of by Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an aspiring bear, Bear Stearns aspires to become a rancher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, it is going to raise 10,000 sheep, 10,000 cows, and 10,000 hives of bees, and then there will be endless animal milk and honey and endless barbecue every day, and it will reach the peak of Xiongsheng from then on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Creatures like locusts are undoubtedly the enemy of rancher bears. If I saw it, I must have killed it wrong, and I didn't let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the shroud of the gravity field, not only the locusts along the way suffered, but other small insects were also kept cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even more perfect if some flowers and plants were not accidentally injured. Natural deworming bear, no longer have to worry about the threat of pests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the thick smoke rising along the road, Hudson breathed a sigh of relief. Obviously, the noble lords have not yet laid down, which means that the situation has not completely collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unharvested grain is basically cool. But as long as the locusts are eliminated in time, the autumn plowing can be kept.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though there is not much to gain this season, it is better than nothing. Until next year's spring grain harvest, they can be resurrected with full blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just an ideal state. Anyone who has experienced locust plagues knows that this thing is \"one plague for ten years\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the locusts are completely wiped out, the eggs all over the earth can still be reborn from the ashes in the coming year. It is almost impossible to kill them cleanly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the response is timely, the locust plague will not be formed. These grasshoppers distributed in various places are also a threat to agricultural production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no accidents, starting from next year, everyone will learn to eat grasshoppers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of a large-scale reduction in grain production, it is imperative to take extraordinary measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking Bear Stearns around the territory with a group, and wiped out all the large-scale locusts, Hudson returned to the Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on, why is the disaster in the territory so severe?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Hudson is still satisfied with the disaster prevention work in the territory. Although there were many problems, his deployment was generally completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the context of locust plagues everywhere, it is a success not to let all the crops be fed to locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, I don't know why the locusts swarmed into the two counties of Wright and Wyton. The mountain territory is remote, and the situation is still good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Territories in plain areas, the disaster situation is really serious. There are several unlucky lords, whose crops have been eaten up by locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the Baron Cayo, although he organized a massive locust extermination operation, Fallen Leaf Town was reduced to white land in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the crops were eaten up, but even the vegetation suffered heavy damage. Even some wooden houses have been attacked by locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strange thing is that the severely affected areas are all the territories of local nobles, but the damage to the territories of the northern nobles is slightly less severe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rumored that the locust plague was caused by the nobles from the North. There were even gossip reports that someone had dropped locust-attracting agents in the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few days ago, our patrol found someone sneaking around and found two vials containing potions. It's a pity that people ran away, otherwise...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Tom's explanation, Hudson wondered if he was a child of luck. Someone ran over to give medicine, but was not only encountered by the patrol, but even the medicine bottle was not broken in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the two medicine bottles in front of him, Hudson didn't rush to open them, but patted the cub on the head, motioning for Bear to check it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, this world has too many shady means, and Hudson doesn't want to die young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, there are very few methods for the bears of Yin Yin, especially bears like Bear Stearns, who can be said to be invulnerable to five poisons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what kind of messy food, he dares to put it in his mouth. Even during the locust extermination war, many of the scorched locusts entered the stomach of this guy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Toxic?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Earth Bear was afraid of poison, Bear Stearns would not be alive now. I have been with Hudson for so long, and I have never seen him eat a bad stomach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Headache and brain fever have never happened once. This anti-virus ability is definitely one of the best in the Aslante continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Bear Stearns, adult earth bears are immune to all toxins and negative energy, and juvenile bears are also immune to most of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns opened the bottle cap and sniffed it with his nose. Before it could give an answer, Hudson heard the buzzing of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Hudson immediately went up and closed the lid. Immediately afterwards, he secretly thought about how to deal with these two bottles of reagents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give it to the Governor's Palace?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there are not many things that can be exchanged. Now everyone knows that someone has dropped locust-attracting potions in the southeastern province, and the identity of the other party cannot be determined. Just two bottles of potions are meaningless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps holding this thing, it is easier to trace the mastermind behind the scenes, but the ones who can be found must be the little people who push to the foreground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big forces planning all this behind the scenes could not have left such obvious traces in a foolish way. Even the person in charge of poisoning may be an unlucky guy hired temporarily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    stay?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also meaningless to Hudson. Although this thing can lure locusts to come and kill them, but with Bear Stearns in charge, Hudson feels that there is no need to do such fancy things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With great difficulty, he helped his bears set up a bear life plan for the big rancher. At this moment, Bear Stearns was at his peak, and if large swarms of locusts dared to come over, they would never leave alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement reached by the two parties, Hudson will then transfer 500 sheep, 200 head of cattle, and more than half of the beehives in the territory to Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, it also provides breeding technology, as well as supporting industry services such as herdsmen, forestry, pasture leasing, etc.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the money, of course I owe it first. The bounty of 8,000 gold coins is not enough to pay off the previous bad debt?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is not a problem. With the performance in this locust plague, the subsequent rewards are still enough for Bear Stearns to pay off the debt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only bears with money in their pockets have the confidence to buy properties. If he was poor and white like before, how could he have the face to speak up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bear who has an industry is now very protective of his calf. Never allow anyone or any insect to affect its ration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for protecting Hudson's territory, that's just incidental. After all, locusts can fly, and if they are not prevented in advance, they will easily spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Falling Leaf Town, the disaster is so serious, didn't Baron Cayo ask his family for help?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large-scale locust plagues, for any lord, the loss is an astronomical sum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This year's autumn grain loss is heavy, and next year's autumn grain is also hopeless, and even the year after will have to continue to suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many locusts have gathered into the territory. If the eggs are not eradicated together, then wait to be patronized by \"grasshoppers\" every year!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it takes shape, it will be a new plague of locusts. It can be said that the wild fire is endless, and the \"summer\" wind blows and regenerates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is said that they are asking for help, but the Dalton family is too busy to take care of themselves now, and there is no time to pay attention to a town.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news comes from hearsay, which may not be accurate. When it comes to the Dalton family, we dare not put intelligence personnel there. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Andrea, who was in charge of intelligence, replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throwing the intelligence organization to an outsider who had just defected, Hudson couldn't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an easy task to build an intelligence organization in a poor and blank situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't talk about inquiring about secret information, just collecting some bright news is very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who keeps the population flow small?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The status of most of the territories is: ten days and a half months, no stranger will appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any stranger approaching will attract the attention of local residents. If the ability is not good, someone will follow the clues and come to the door in minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson just wants to inquire about the news, but he is not going to make enemies with his neighbors. This kind of hatred thing is absolutely unacceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply leave it to \"outsiders\" to do it. If it is really exposed, Master Hudson can still say that he doesn't know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He insisted that someone sent a spy to try to provoke everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't believe me, you can look it up, there are definitely problems with the origins of these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of which faction is found, he can be cleared of the suspicion of Master Hudson. Since everyone is a victim, it is natural to aim their hatred at the guy who planted the spy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all experiences gained through **** life lessons. When it comes to the ability to shake the pot, Hudson is now proficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the hidden dangers of the intelligence organization after it grows, it is purely overthinking. Under the existing conditions, Hudson's intelligence organization simply does not have the possibility of development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The servants used by the nobles have served the family for generations, and the children and grandchildren are bound together, and outsiders can't get in at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to play the trick of selling yourself as a slave, then go ahead and be a slave for several generations! Without the hard work of several generations, it is simply impossible to gain the trust of the master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to guarantee the loyalty of decades of dormancy, let alone several generations of dormancy. Such a test of human nature is simply ridiculous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no problem with loyalty, the protracted infiltration mode, before the spies get close to the core of power, Hudson suspects that he will grow grass first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spies can't get in, and it's even harder to buy them. It is estimated that as soon as the terms were negotiated on the front foot, they were reported on the back foot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decades, or even hundreds of years, of enslaving education cannot be shaken by a few words. The interests of slaves were tied to nobles early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the power declines, the servants who follow will also be unable to please. Even if you want to betray, you have to have your master willing to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ultra-low population flow determines that organizations like Jinyiwei have no soil to survive in the continent of Aslant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to buying other people's trusted servants, it is easier to buy nobles under his command. Because of the convergence of interests, these people can also betray because of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the betrayal chips given are large enough, there is no need to worry about everyone not betraying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that if he could afford that price, Hudson himself would have become a great nobleman. Playing the game directly is, why do you need to engage in these tricks that are not on the table?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just watch from a distance, you don't have to get too close. Pay attention to the situation in the two counties and find that I always feel that someone is deliberately provoking conflicts.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is supercilious, it's that the rumors about \"nobility in the North being poisoned\" are too magical. This is a plague of locusts, nothing else.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the territories of the northern nobles were slightly damaged, that was only \"slightly\", and the actual loss was not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no food harvest for a year, and the local nobles could not die of starvation, but for all the northern lands, it was a life-and-death test.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the response is not appropriate, starving to death is inevitable. At that time, not only the property will be lost, but also the hearts of the people in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the nobles of the Northlands, triggering a locust plague is a typical example of \"killing eight hundred enemies and harming oneself three thousand\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the local nobles had a greater motivation to play like this. As local snakes, everyone can completely drag down this group of outsiders by virtue of their material advantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this strength, there are only five or six local nobles who implement this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the lord's personal ability and family investment, there are even fewer ambitions and motivations to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the main suspects, Hudson can exclude himself, so the man behind the scenes is likely to be another beneficiary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a large-scale food shortage breaks out, there are not many families in the entire southeastern province that can provide food to help everyone tide over the crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the Dalton family behind the Baron Cayo has this strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So many coincidences happened to collide together, it's hard not to make Hudson think too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a suspicion, and it involves the Dalton family. Without sufficient evidence, Hudson will not easily express his position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The outside world mistakenly believes that the mountain leaders are strong and strong, but Hudson is very aware of how weak his own strength is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the veterans who have seen blood and have been trained to become real elites, the rest are all appearances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to put up a formation, but if there is a fight, they will kill cattle and sheep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat power is higher than that of ordinary serf soldiers, and how far it is from the real elite can only be known after fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he doesn't continue training for a year or so, Hudson really has no confidence to let his own soldiers go to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, should we let go of such a good opportunity?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Ezekiel asked unwillingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the loser in the last round of battle, Baron Ezekiel gained nothing except gaining some fame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the passage of time, even these false names are slowly fading away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Real nobles, when they encounter problems, the first thing they think of is Baron Cayo and Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fame only brought Ezekiel convenience in interpersonal communication, and when it came to tangible benefits, his opinion was no longer important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The kingdom needs stability, which is the need of the overall situation.

The most important thing for us now is to fight against the locust plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autumn harvest is greatly reduced, and we can still work hard to keep the spring grain for the next season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This plague of locusts is extraordinary. Not only is this year's autumn grain production greatly reduced, but next year's autumn grain harvest will also be difficult to harvest too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food crisis alone is enough for those guys to bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wouldn't it be nice to watch them have bad luck?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why jump out to rescue them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is the lesson from last time not enough? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sneered and mocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to use him as a weapon is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that they are fighting with the northern nobles, they have to work hard. Only if they win, will those guys have food to survive the famine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, in order to reduce food consumption, all the northern nobles are artificially reducing the number of slaves under their command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some ruthless ones ground the locusts into powder and added them to bread making. Many serfs with weak physical resistance also died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to prove how difficult the life of those guys is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Shandi led the way in making locust powder, Hudson only took locusts alone, and he didn't dare to take the locust army that gathered together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if locust powder is made, it is only added in a small amount, accounting for less than one percent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small dose, even toxins can be overcome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. After reducing the supply of rations, the nutritional supply of slaves must be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One grasshopper a day is considered meaty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that no one responded from the nobles, Baron Ezekiel suddenly became embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You just said it well, everyone put pressure on the baron of the mountain region, forcing the boss to take the lead in making trouble with the nobles of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, when the situation came to an end, Hudson made a group of \"temporary allies\" who were not firm stand back back with just a few words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether he was persuaded or unwilling to confront the Mountain Baron, no one can say clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, no one wants to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Baron Ezekiel's eyes asking for help, everyone wandered away, as if they hadn't seen anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Feeling the importance of strength again, Baron Ezekiel is more and more eager to break the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the existing political structure of Wright County, the local nobles are mixed with Hudson, and the northern nobles are mixed with the Baron of Sith. There is no room for display at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in Wyton County next door is similar. Although the northern nobles are divided, most of the local nobles look at the face of Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Birth determined that Baron Ezekiel could not play happily with the nobles of the North, and among the local nobles, Barons Hudson and Cayo were on strict guard against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the small teams formed by each of them, there is no place for Baron Ezekiel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Want to form gangs and be targeted by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neutral aristocrats are not stupid, how could they mix with such an empty-headed guy like him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful his tricks are, it is not enough for everyone to weigh the pros and cons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this pattern continues, it won't be long before the reputation he has accumulated through painstaking efforts will be consumed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dadir City, affected by the changing situation, a group of northern nobles also sat together to discuss countermeasures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the topic they discussed was not who to fight with, but how to raise enough food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Baron Sith, this day is really unbearable, please help to find a way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the plague of locusts, the storage of autumn grain in Boteling was less than one-third of the normal output. Originally, the area sown was small, but it caught up with this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce food consumption, I have ordered all the citizens to stop giving birth and reduced the food supply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including my lord's food standard, they were all lowered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I don't even dare to eat a meal of barbecue, and I change everything to stew, so that my subordinates can get some meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this is still a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current grain stock in the territory, if we persist for another three months at most, the cooking smoke will be cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now the locust plague is still raging, and all the active people in the territory have joined the battle to exterminate the locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the locusts seem to be in a steady stream. After killing one crop, another crop comes again, and they cannot be completely killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, Qiu Geng can't count on it. How to live the next day, I don't know now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Bazel said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the lack of cooking for three months may be exaggerated, the food shortage does exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to deal with the crisis, Bazel really did his best. Now the slaves in the territory have begun to catch and eat locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you know that locusts are poisonous, it is better to be poisoned than to be starved to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on strong physical resistance, some orcs survived, but more orcs were lying on the hospital bed and howling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, these guys lying down are now eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are slaves miserable, but serfs are also miserable. The rations have been greatly reduced, and driven by hunger, many people also eat locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching all this happen, Baron Bazel still turned a blind eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For Botland, reducing the population is the only effective way to deal with the crisis if no new food source can be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Bazel. At least there is a small river in your territory, so you can get some fish supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My territory is miserable, except for the bare land, there is nothing left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those **** locusts, even the wild vegetables will not be spared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this continues, I will have to eat dirt. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Justin Knight teased bitterly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no worst, only worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps in the eyes of the local nobles, the locust plagues suffered by the northern lords were lighter, but the losses suffered by everyone were devastating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the constant complaints from the crowd, Baron Sith only felt his scalp go numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If you want to wear a crown, you must bear its weight; if you want to hold a rose, you must bear its wounds.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enjoy the bonus of being the boss, but also bear the obligation of being the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, the business prosperity of Dadir City before was supported by these younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the little brothers are almost hungry, how could he, the boss, not show it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the Sith Baron was also short of food. Although he snapped up a batch in time, the locust plague could never end!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own territory is reducing ration consumption, so how can I help others?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is facing the same situation. In the final analysis, the biggest problem is the lack of food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The plague of locusts has spread so widely that nobles from all over the country have suspended grain sales. In a short period of time, it is difficult for us to purchase enough food in the southeast province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current plan, we can only organize caravans to go to other human countries to see if we can gain anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The country closest to us is the Kingdom of Hesse. Unfortunately, it is blocked by the Black Stone Mountains, so we have to take a long detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to send people there, but it is a big problem to transport a large amount of food back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the long consumption time, the key is that half of the food will be consumed halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The easiest way is undoubtedly to take the water route. Unfortunately, most of the coastal ports are controlled by the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given Governor Pierce's hostility towards us, the possibility of giving us a way is very slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is an excuse, the vast sea is extremely dangerous. It is not surprising that an entire army was wiped out at sea. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith's words undoubtedly poured cold water on everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the boss doesn't think of a solution, it's that he has exhausted all the solutions, but there is no reliable solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not enough food to be bought internally, but the outside world can buy food, but the problem is that it cannot be shipped back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total population of the territories of the nobles of the North was 70,000 to 80,000 people, and if slaves were included, the population exceeded 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Livestock must also be considered, let alone cattle and sheep, the rations of war horses must not be deducted, right? To solve the food shortage, at least tens of millions of pounds of food must be imported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a huge gap, there is a detour of nearly a thousand miles. Land transportation is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sea transportation, unless you get the support of the Dalton family, no matter how many people go out, the whole army will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, everyone needs to pay attention to the appearance of food and not go too far.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the vast sea, it is too common for a fleet to go missing. Even if Wang Guo wanted to investigate, he didn't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We have no food, but it doesn't mean that other people have no food. Instead of lamenting here, it is better to talk to them directly and honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either sell us food to tide over this difficulty. Either we all leave and go to **** together. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have accumulated too much grievance recently, and I urgently need a channel to vent it. Anyway, deep in the troubles of the July meeting, it is unknown whether he can get out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the people were worried about doing so and causing bad consequences, but Baron Kettley didn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win the bet, you will continue to be a nobleman here; if you lose the bet, you will run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, once the thunder of the July Festival explodes, he will still have to flee to the end of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A little earlier, with so many people accompanying, is not a bad thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The matter did not reach this level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We were also able to turn to the Kingdom for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone mobilize the connections behind them, and work together to put pressure on the Dalton family. Our Governor cannot withstand such great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the time comes, he will naturally choose to compromise. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith hurriedly comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that now is not the time to provoke conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles do have food in their hands, but it doesn't mean that they also store a lot of food in their newly opened territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Neighbors hoard food, I hoard guns.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The premise is that the neighbors have stocked up on food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people don't store much food, even if they win the battle, it will be difficult to get the expected harvest, and it will only cause trouble for the upper body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley suffered continuous setbacks and was about to break the pot. Baron Sith, who still had a bright future, didn't want to be with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Background back to background, Caesar III is not someone to mess with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A guy who can only cause trouble and cannot maintain local stability, why should he be the sheriff of either side?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's the grand duke's illegitimate son, even the grand duke's direct son, if he can't be brought up well, he can only be a rice moth\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A conflict provoked by someone with a heart, was suppressed by the tacit understanding of the two giants in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the real problem of locust plague still needs to be solved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have a relationship can initiate a relationship, and those who have no relationship can only save themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while Hudson became busy, to be exact, Bear Stearns became busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the army of locusts, the efficiency of artificial locust extermination is really too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be much easier to switch to the Earth Bear. Not only can it kill the current locusts, but it can also kill the eggs in the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially locust eggs, that thing is even more stubborn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Traditional methods use manpower and natural resources such as water and fire to kill, not to mention low efficiency, and many fish slip through the net.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the locust eggs are too small to be mixed in the soil, and it is easy to ignore them with the naked eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect of fire is the best, but you can't burn all the land, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect of magic potion on killing insect eggs is also good. Unfortunately, the price of that thing is high, and the output is pitifully low, which is not enough for the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who has the unique skills of exterminating insects, soon came into everyone's sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the shroud of the gravity field, even the locusts couldn't stand it, and naturally the eggs couldn't stand it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are bare areas everywhere, and there is no trouble of accidentally hurting flowers and plants, and the cubs can let them toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that there must be a fee to kill the locusts, and even the eggs will be dealt with, and there will be an extra fee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering a bear who only recognizes money, Hudson is also very helpless. If this continues, the outside world still doesn't know how to arrange him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft caused trouble, and the master has to take the blame!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to facilitate bargaining, Bear Stearns insisted on learning to speak in advance, so that Hudson had no chance to make the difference if he wanted to be a middleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harvest is not without, everyone thought that Master Hudson's bear had grown up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deterrent power of the mountain territory +10086...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to cover up this time. The Earth Bear can only use the common language of the mainland when he is an adult. This is a “truth” recognized by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who was only two years and three months old, now has to announce that he is 230 years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Hudson, he was lucky enough to pick up a soon-to-adult Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether Hudson believes it or not, the outside world believes this statement anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one doubted this time that Bear Stearns was the earth bear captured by the Holy See, and his age was simply not matched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earth Bear, which is approaching adulthood, also has great fighting power, and it is almost impossible to capture it alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this world where the weak prey on the strong, the charm of the strong is unparalleled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who pretends to be Xiongwei, will receive the warmest welcome no matter where he goes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the nobles who complained about the high fees did not say anything anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top powerhouse in the mainland is willing to help exterminate the locusts, and it is too conscientious to only charge one silver coin per mu of land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't want to, there are still people rushing to line up behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not everyone's territory, and the unit is not ten thousand mu, this kind of charging standard is really not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the speed is a little faster, it can only show that the efficiency is high. In any case, Mr. Bear Stearns had to take a stroll over there himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In one day, the troubles of more than a dozen noble families can be solved. Seeing Bear Stearns making a lot of money every day, Hudson suddenly found himself a poor man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, it was Xiong who worked for him. I didn't expect that Feng Shui would take turns. Now it's his turn to work for Xiong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they managed to get a good price, according to the highest appearance fee standard of \"Shen Bow Knight\", 500 gold coins per day and overtime pay will be calculated separately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson was not happy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that the treasury of Bear Stearns must be emptied as soon as possible, otherwise this product would be able to fly to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a deep introspection, Hudson found that he was not dark enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reporting too little for cultivation expenses, anyway, the energy is stored in my own compass. Even Bear Stearns would not know if the magic spar consumption was falsely reported more than ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason: Increased strength requires higher energy purity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing wrong with it, but there must be a loss in energy purification. This is common sense in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just need services, monopoly buying and selling, no room for bargaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leasing of pastures and after-sales service only need a little extra. These visible costs are no longer enough to fool bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps fooling the bear to develop the swamp is also a good choice. As long as Bear Stein is willing to contribute, the development progress will definitely increase greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: Before digging the ditch, use magic to temporarily harden the silt on both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is obviously not a good time to set off a plague of locusts. After raising them for a year to become fat and strong, the effect of releasing them will definitely be better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that for the insect king, it is indeed cruel by a billion points. As a captive wretch, he will spend the next year in the laboratories of magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many ways to artificially ripen Warcraft, most of which have sequelae. If it is a contract monster, these extraordinary methods cannot be used at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it doesn't matter if you use it to deal with the insect king. There is a long way to go from the worm king to the worm king, and the success rate is pitifully low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the worm kings died before they left. With the greatest natural enemy of human beings, the road to the promotion of the insect king cannot be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to cause trouble to the enemy as much as possible, under Caesar III's special instructions, these unlucky bug kings enjoyed special treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Various methods of ripening Warcraft, constantly trying on them. In order to cultivate a stronger insect king, the magicians are also brainstorming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the method was a bit harsher, there was no better choice for the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't inflict heavy damage on the enemy, just bear the loss alone, the gap between the two sides will only be widened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fire was set by the enemy. If others dared to target the Alpha Kingdom so unscrupulously, Caesar III would not mind fighting back with an eye for an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A plan is a plan after all, and the first thing to face is reality. Looking at the statistical loss report in his hand, Caesar III felt a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the influence of the locust plague, several major grain-producing provinces in the south have either drastically reduced production or directly failed to harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss caused by this is completely astronomical. You don't need to think about it to know that the taxes in these provinces this year must be hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, even the boss can't throw stones at the younger brother. No matter how tight your finances are, you can't exhaust your resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the tax gone, but the food and grass that should have supported the front line in northern Xinjiang will also shrink significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only consolation is: Except for a few thick-skinned guys, most of the lords and nobles did not reach out to the kingdom for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to prove that the younger brothers can manage their families diligently and frugally. Even if they encounter natural disasters of this level, they can live on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under such circumstances, the letters of appeal from the noble lords of the northern borders of Wyton and Wright Counties seemed very obtrusive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved once again that one cannot offend the immediate superior. Under normal circumstances, the Governor's Mansion would first withhold such unnutritious distress letters, and report them to the higher authorities after artistic processing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation this time is special. Earl Pierce, who wanted to wear small shoes for them, did not summarize, refine the essence, or artistically process them at all, and directly transferred them to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Falling into the eyes of Caesar III, the resentment will naturally rise. When stationed in the northern border, facing the threat of orcs, he reached out for help every now and then, and he could barely understand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the situation is different now. They all went to the south to enjoy their blessings, and they still love to toss so much. Compared with the performance of other disaster-stricken nobles, this wave of performance is undoubtedly a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that a group of people are not pleasing to the eye, and they will find it pleasing to the eye no matter what they do. The best choice is not to appear, as long as it appears, it is an eyesore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The disaster situation, let the provinces handle it according to their discretion!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with a facial expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a king, you cannot make decisions based on your own likes and dislikes. However, this wave of eye medicine was still in place, which made Caesar III dislike the noble children of the Northland even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of conflict is inevitable. Even if there is no grievance from the ancestors, it is difficult for anyone to have a good impression of a group of people who ask for money, food, and supplies every day, but can't see anything in return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small episode is not worth mentioning to the king who manages everything day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of minor nobles asking for help is also not a big deal to a group of princes and ministers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the families of these people asked someone to intercede, that would not be enough for everyone to reject the king's decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the word \"discretionary\". There are too many answers that can be interpreted, and there is no fault at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is not handled well, it must be the governor below who did not understand the deep meaning of the king. It is definitely not that the great king did not make arrangements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, how do you arrange for the capture of those heroes of the Insect King?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that in the eyes of the prime minister, appeasing these meritorious ministers is more important than dealing with a group of small nobles asking for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, those who can capture the insect king are the top experts in the kingdom, representing the highest combat effectiveness in the southern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"They are the pillars of the country, worldly fame and fortune are hard to tempt them. Then open up some precious resources and let them freely exchange them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are other requirements, as long as they are not too excessive, they can also be discussed. Let the governors of various places do a good job of communication and appeasement, and don't make jokes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said thoughtfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When dealing with the strong, the mainland countries will always win over. There is no one, and there are many domestic masters who dislike it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One or two masters may not be a big deal to a kingdom. But when this number expands to dozens, or even hundreds, it can affect the rise and fall of a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the Alpha Kingdom, which needs to compete with the orcs, the number of top players is even more important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous wars, these people were able to play an important role in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been happily and happily busy for more than half a month, one person and one bear appeared in almost all the hardest-hit areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns has become the richest bear in the continent of Aslante, which is still a long way from the unprecedented bear. The main reason is that the ancestor of the Earth Bear was too powerful, and once \"mastered\" the artifact and fought against the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The value of the artifact is really hard to measure, and it is definitely not something that can be bought with gold coins. Taking a mountain collar, still can't keep up with the value of the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, evil **** weapons like the \"Blood Moon Horn\" don't count. Because of its bad reputation and everyone shouting and beating it, it cannot be used publicly, resulting in a greatly reduced value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, no matter how rich Bear Stearns is, he is still a bear after all, and it is Hudson who attracts the attention of the noble lady.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If before this, he was still a potential stock, but now he has transformed into a high-speed growth stock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that if you don't place your bet quickly, you will miss the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, for many, the opportunity has been missed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While exterminating the locusts, Hudson dropped by his hometown. From what Baron Redman said, the quality of the nobles who intend to marry him has been raised to a higher level on the whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary houses of knights and most of the houses of barons, knowing that there was no hope, all retreated automatically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead, a group of mid-level nobles joined the candidates, and even the collaterals of the big families entered the candidate list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the marriage partner is finalized, the children of nobles serve as backups for each other, which is very common in noble circles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman has a bunch of information on noble girls, and the woman's parents also have a lot of information on noble children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Add it if you think it is suitable, find someone to test it out, and if you think it works, that is the candidate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final decision mainly depends on family interests, personal wishes, and the development of the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter to ordinary children's marriages, even if they mess up, things won't be too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for a child like Hudson whose family placed high hopes on him, not only Baron Redman cared about his marriage, but other parties also paid close attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the least concerned is probably Hudson himself. Even if he is single, how about two elder brothers in front of him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, before deciding on his marriage, the two single dogs must be arranged first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is still young in grade, can continue to wait. After all, many candidates are still little kids. The so-called suitability is just that the family background is suitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Nelson and Evora, who are a few years older, are most likely to be in the last year or two. Anyway, before Hudson's marriage is finalized, they will definitely be arranged first, so as not to make people laugh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the drop in temperature and the desperate hunting and killing of nobles and lords from all walks of life, the vigorous insect plague soon came to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The insect king that everyone shouted and beat disappeared from people's sight early. Whether it was extinct or hid secretly to wait for the right time, no one knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, this catastrophe is over for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the efforts of Bear Stearns, the area with the worst pest infestation in the province also kept the autumn plowing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The neighboring provinces were miserable. Although Hudson didn't mind taking Bear Stearns for a trip, it was still too late for the season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the army of locusts was gone, and Qiu Geng missed it again. Everyone was unwilling to spend the unjust money, so they simply organized an army of serfs to continue to consume the scattered locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows whether this decision is right or wrong. But I have to admit that Bear Stearns does have a talent for doing business, which is better than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Hudson can talk about human feelings, but in front of Uncle Xiong, it doesn't bother to care who is who.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One silver coin and one mu of land, if you can accept it, you can do it;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to play with package price. Bear Stearns is a bear who admits to death, one more silver coin will be accepted, and one less silver coin can overturn the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless to get Hudson down. Uncle Xiong directly said: If you are not afraid of meeting a bear at night, you can get a “50%” discount on the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the shameless bear, none of the nobles dared to ask for a discount in order not to be \"broken\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the poor need credit, it is Hudson who pays in advance. Compared with the money owed to Uncle Xiong, everyone felt that it was better to owe Baron Hudson money, even if they needed to owe favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In line with the principle of rotten meat in his own pot, Hudson did not stop Bear Stearns from throwing money. After all, it is too difficult to get money out of the pockets of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By contrast, entering Bear Stearns' pocket is equivalent to entering his Master Hudson's pocket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gold coins piled up into mountains, even if you want to count them, you can't count them! The left and right are kept by Hudson, and what Bear Stearns owns is just a number on the account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Hudson is providing loans, but in fact, Bear Stearns' money is in the left hand and the right hand. The right to use all the funds is free, and there is no interest for a penny. Naturally, Hudson can exchange favors with ultra-low interest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only a loan, but also an investment. As long as the reputation is not broken, this game can continue to be played.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without experience reference, no matter how smart a bear is, it is impossible to think of such a shameless way of playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bayda City, revisiting the old place again, Hudson feels differently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the treatment was still the same as last time, it was top-notch, but the eyes of everyone looking at him were obviously full of awe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grown-up Earth Bear, who is a real hammer, directly led him to become the number one expert in the southeastern province. At least on the surface, Hudson doesn't know if there are more powerful characters behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from queuing up before entering the Governor's Mansion, this time Earl Pierce came to welcome them as soon as they entered the door, and gave them a lot of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unhappiness between the two of them before seemed as if nothing had happened. For this change, Hudson is still happy to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has secretly decided that for the sake of Earl Pierce being so sensible, he will not go to his grave to play disco in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some polite greetings, Hudson decisively took out a bottle of \"locust attractant potion\" and put it on the table, and said casually: \"Your Excellency, this is the alchemy work of Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the quality, you already have six or seven points of skill. Congratulations to the Dalton family, a new alchemist is about to be born. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alchemist\" is not \"Master Alchemist\", the gap between the two is like a gap. Those with talent leap over, those without talent stay where they are forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce could hear the irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a new master alchemist, it will naturally be a great joy for the Dalton family. But just being a quasi-alchemist is a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't know that if you want an alchemist, you have to throw money into it first. I don't know when the results will come out. Anyway, the way to lose money must be arranged first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, what does this mean?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving face to face does not mean that he is afraid. As the master of the southeast province, just being a bear of the earth is not enough to make him bow his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the owner of this bear is still in the circle of game rules, so the threat he can pose is even smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, don't misunderstand me. I came here with good intentions. If you don't believe me, you will understand when you open the potion.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If before that, Baron Cayo put in the locust-attracting potion, he would decisively choose to rot in his stomach. Even if there is sufficient evidence, he will not come forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it's different now. Hudson, who is pretending to be Xiongwei, has some negotiating capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the talk collapses, the Dalton family will not have the idea of ​​killing people. An adult Earth Bear will run with one unless a dragon is sent to intercept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think the Dalton family has an adult dragon. If there were such a big killer, it would have been known throughout the continent long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment he opened the bottle cap, Earl Pierce's expression changed drastically. With a trembling voice, he said, \"How is this possible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, there must be a misunderstanding here!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson, don't you suspect Kayo...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I misunderstood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know anything, I just stopped by to congratulate the Dalton family, a new alchemist is about to be added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the locust-attracting agent, it is natural that the Governor's Office should send someone to investigate and deal with it. I was just a bystander, and I happened to see some unimportant clues, so I brought them along. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson hinted nakedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was delivered here, naturally in exchange for benefits. If you want to cheat the Dalton family, these things, together with the clues in Hudson's hands, should all be sent to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of hatred thing, once exposed. The Dalton family will no longer want to hang out in the aristocratic circle, and the affected nobles will whip them to death for a lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is righteousness to kill relatives, everyone will not believe it. Maybe the scapegoat for causing the locust plague this time may be pinned on their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the political opponents are more vicious, and by the way label them colluding with the Holy See, the Dalton family can be removed from the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the probability of this situation is not high. After all, it is a long-established aristocrat, and the Dalton family's network background is by no means as simple as it seems on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you deal with it properly and are willing to pay a certain price, it is still possible to suppress the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accusations were not confirmed, it was just some gossip, but they could not shake their foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, it is Hudson's turn to be unlucky. There have been too many incidents in history where people were killed when they failed to file a complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same big force is going to die, Hudson feels that for his own life, it is better not to try it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the current mountain territory is too weak, even if the Dalton family is defeated, there will not be much cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Understanding the meaning behind the words, Earl Pierce's face instantly turned cloudy, and he said with a smile: \"Baron Hudson is right, this is indeed a misunderstanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cayo's talent is limited, he is only an intermediate magician so far, how can he become an alchemist!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency came from afar, but for the reward. You and I have been friends for generations, as long as it can be resolved, I will solve it for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to \"Friendship through the ages\", Hudson almost laughed out loud. To put it bluntly, even now, Earl Pierce may not be able to pronounce his father's name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The level gap between the two sides is too great, and a small family like Koslow simply cannot get into the eyes of Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, the two parties are still people from two worlds. Being able to sit here and talk peacefully is because Earl Pierce is unwilling to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly, Earl Pierce didn't know how deeply Baron Cayo had been mixed up, and whether he had mixed up with people from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the exposure of the matter, the heavy price that needs to be paid. It is obviously much simpler to buy Hudson to seal it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the position of Sheriff of Wright County has not been decided for a long time, which has affected the local development. As a nobleman, I want to get this opportunity to share the worries of the kingdom.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long time, Hudson has not been sure about the Wright County sheriff dispute. The most important reason is that there is no one in the court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't think that the Dalton family will fight for him just because of the local affection of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Hudson, you are too late. In fact, the position of Sheriff was decided in the royal capital long before the division of fiefs last year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called unresolved is actually just a scene deliberately arranged by the Grand Duke in order to train his son. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't want to help, it's just that the dust has settled. Want to overthrow the decision to overthrow the capital again, unless Baron Sith has his own problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Designing a grand duke's son is not so easy to arrange. It's nothing more than a small fight. If he is abolished directly, Grand Duke Kavadia will definitely interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not surprised to get this answer. He has seen a lot of similar weird things, and relatively speaking, this is already considered appetizing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it was just for show, they have gone through all the procedures. If it weren't for Hudson's sudden birth, Baron Sith could have taken the position under everyone's expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical: \"Three points depend on hard work, seven points depend on luck, and the remaining 90 points depend on dad.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The father of a grand duke is enough to erase all the efforts of Hudson. Even if he has become famous now and is considered by countless nobles in the province as the most suitable person to be the Sheriff of Wright County, it will not have any effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I see, thank you Earl for your advice!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What should have been expected, now really happened. Hudson found that he still couldn't face it calmly. After all, his previous life was too smooth, which made him ignore the cruel nature of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no way to be the sheriff, but if you don't want to be inferior to Baron Sith, you can still do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on your achievements in capturing the Insect King before, I can help you run a viscount. I am still somewhat sure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there is no way to increase the fiefdom. It is nothing more than assigning the Salam Mountains you are currently operating and the swamp to you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Just changing the title will not bring substantial benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for others, the gap between the viscount and the baron is an insurmountable gap, which belongs to the leap of class.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the outside world, if you cross this step, even if you have entered the threshold of middle-class nobles, the rest is only time accumulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the dust had not yet settled and the news had not spread, the Koslow family would have a grand celebration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is reckoned that the heads of various branch branches distributed across the country will come to participate in the celebration in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo, who didn't know about the incident, was busy with the official affairs of the territory, so he was summoned to the Governor's Palace by the family knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the group of trusted servants kneeling in the hall, Baron Cayo was dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could react, Earl Pierce's whip had already been drawn. Fortunately, his father died early, otherwise this wave would be doubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pump continued until he was ripped apart and fell to the ground crying, before Earl Pierce managed to suppress his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No need to say anything, Baron Kayo knew that the gang of trash under him must have betrayed him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What he couldn't understand was why his uncle would be so furious over such a trivial matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Asshole, tell me the truth, how much did you get involved in this matter?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing Earl Pierce's questioning, Baron Cayo's head was completely stunned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How much blended\"?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the **** is this?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that apart from putting a few bottles of locust-attracting potions in the two counties of Wright and Wyton, he hasn't done anything else recently?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I still don't admit it, let's see what this is?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, an inconspicuous vial flew out of Earl Pierce's hand and landed steadily in front of Baron Cayo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the familiar vial in front of him, Baron Cayo became even more displeased with the servants. The potion that was used to deceive people actually appeared here intact. Isn't this a blatant betrayal?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder there was no news from the outside world, and he was caught. His feelings were betrayed by an inner ghost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, I'm going to discuss this matter with you. It's just that you were busy organizing manpower to suppress the locust plague at that time, and didn't give me a chance to communicate alone, so...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Baron Cayo could finish his explanation, Earl Pierce became more and more angry, pointed at him and cursed tremblingly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You idiot, this is trying to kill the family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Baron Cayo became more and more confused. Just throwing a few bottles of locust-attracting potion, how could it be involved in killing the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Dalton family were so fragile, they would have been swallowed up long ago, so why would they be so brilliant today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, this is a misunderstanding! How could I...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't explain it, just explain it like this. Earl Pierce's whip was whipped at him again, with that expression of hatred for iron and steel, as if he wanted to eat people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What a misunderstanding!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Colluded with the Holy See to release locust-attracting agents in the southeastern province. You **** dare to do such a lifeless thing. Is there anything else you dare not do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today I don't…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After figuring out what was going on, Baron Cayo wanted to cry without tears. \"Collude with the Holy See\", this hat is deadly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are no explicit regulations in the kingdom's decrees, there has long been an unspoken rule among the nobles - not to associate with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bearing such a crime, not only can't get along in the Alpha Kingdom. In more than 90% of the human race countries, there is no place for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a powerful force like the Dalton family, once the real hammer colludes with the Holy See, there will be no place for them to stand in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, you are wronged!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have nothing to do with the Holy See!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to your instructions, I have always kept a respectful distance from people in the Holy See. He didn't even say a few words, so how could he collude with them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he is really scared. Just throwing locust-attracting potions in the two counties, with their own strength, they can still handle it, but if it involves collusion with the Holy See, it will be the end of the calf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to his nephew's explanation, he realized that Earl Pierce, who had made a misunderstanding, looked much better, but his anger was still hard to calm down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fool!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just such a little thing, I can't do it well. After staying in the capital for so many years, he didn't make any progress at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now someone came to the door with evidence, and I don't know it yet. Why didn't I realize that you kid is such a waste?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a crime to be a black hand, but if someone catches a black hand, it is a serious crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a nobleman, one must have a glamorous appearance. Dark methods can only be placed under the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Baron Cayo was caught, even if he was not charged with colluding with the Holy See, it would still be an indelible stain on his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a quarrel breaks out, not only Baron Cayo will be finished, but the Dalton family will also be ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing his uncle's reprimand, Kayo wanted to cry but had no tears. Obviously he was very careful, in order to hide his identity, he didn't even send his own people to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Afterwards, they even sent people to kill all the unlucky ones they hired. The plan was perfect, but unfortunately it still failed to avoid the incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle, I did this matter very covertly. Except for these few cronies, the other executors were all silenced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logically speaking, it should not be exposed. Where did you get this thing? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cayo asked bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to die, you have to be a ghost. What's more, he couldn't die this time. If he really planned to kill his relatives righteously, Earl Pierce would not bother to teach him a lesson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opinionated stuff!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has been delivered to the door, I don't know who brought it, you are really amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it for yourself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't figure it out, just stay here and don't go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Save yourself from continuing to embarrass yourself and embarrass your family...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nephew who has been painstakingly cultivated is actually this kind of guy, and he doesn't know how to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the life of a nobleman is not smooth sailing. If you don't suffer setbacks in your youth, the beatings you will encounter in the future will only become more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the children of the great nobles have to be sent out to practice, in order to let them suffer setbacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure is not terrible. As long as you can learn lessons and accumulate experience, the nobles will have the capital and teaching fees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Geniuses are a minority after all, and the probability of birthing a genius is even lower if the family bloodline is the inheritance system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of them are middle-aged, slowly honed through acquired education.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Earl Pierce himself, he also came out after experiencing countless setbacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that for Baron Cayo, the reality is too cruel. I am afraid of comparison in everything. If you are surrounded by players of the same level, you will not be discouraged even if you fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What Baron Cocayo faced was obviously not an ordinary player. There are too many talents gathered in the two counties of Wright and Wyton, so he has to be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how cautious you are, you still have to take action. However, this first step has caused him to be severely beaten by the society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After calming down, he reviewed the recent changes in the two counties, and Baron Cayo broke into a cold sweat instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The areas where the locust plague was released were basically devastated, except for the mountainous areas to hide in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought it was the Earth Bear, but now it seems that it is clearly the potion that was supposed to be placed in the mountain territory, but it did not work, but appeared here as evidence against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's too late to regret it, the truth is revealed, and the **** blossoms. Now that the beating is over, I can't beat him back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The annoyed Baron Cayo wanted to give himself two big slaps. Obviously made a decision not to cause trouble before Hudson ran out of energy, but unexpectedly...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson is busy sharing the spoils with Bear Stearns. To operate the title, the kingdom's rewards are probably useless, but the province's rewards are still there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through a series of insider transactions, a total of two million pounds of rye, ten life essences, a pile of magic crystals, and some basic cultivation resources were obtained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the price of food has been soaring in the disaster year, and now there is no market for the price. If it weren't for Bear Stearns' face, it is estimated that they would not be able to exchange so many things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has never been stingy when dealing with great heroes. Putting all the gains directly in front of the cub, he announced domineeringly: \"Bear Stearns, this time you have contributed the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here is magic spar, and the other side is food, life essence, and basic cultivation resources. Anyway, the values ​​of both are similar, so you choose first! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Bear Stearns angrily rolled his eyes, and unceremoniously took the magic spar as his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Multiple Choice?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's an insult to the bear's IQ. Besides magic spar, what else are they?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basic training resources are just right for Hudson to use. Put it on Bear Stearns, not to mention the fart effect, even the appetite can not be satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The raw liquid of life is similar. The little energy contained in it is not as good as the feed pill refined by Hudson to Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food is even worse. For all its appetite, Bear Stearns isn't eating bread every day. Two million pounds of rye, a bear can't finish it until it's moldy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, once the grain is selected, storage fees, care fees, fire protection fees... will all follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bear rancher, what Bear Stearns is most tired of now is all kinds of messy fees. Uncle Xiong gets annoyed when he sees the thick bill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson just smiled slightly at this scene. No matter what you choose, the end result is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic spar could not survive the night in the hands of Bear Stearns either. Compared to slowly absorbing the energy in the magic spar, how can it be more refreshing to open it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong, who is used to a life of luxury, can no longer go back. If he really wanted to go back to the past practice of turtle speed, Uncle Xiong would rather go back and have a good sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the spoils were divided, Hudson was about to leave when he was stopped by the Cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't forget your Viscount, and Ben Xiong's share.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the serious Bear Stearns, Hudson nodded. Repudiating debts is not his style, and the important role played by his own bear must be recognized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Bear Stearns. This kind of thing will definitely not forget your credit. I will add your profile picture on the family crest and let you share the glory...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could finish speaking, Bear Stearns spread his paws and fell to the ground, angrily said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to deceive Ben Xiong!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's obvious that you want to put my face on the family crest to show off your achievements, but you insist on sharing the glory, and those who don't know think I'm taking advantage of you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To tell you the truth, the old man Redman has already prepared the badge. It's just that the carving is too ugly, so I was rejected by Ben Xiong! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft engraved on the family badge is a routine operation. There is a powerful monster, if you don't show it off on the family crest, it will be a shame to the vanity of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many tribesmen who have this idea. It's just that in the past, Bear Stearns' reputation was not obvious, and it couldn't be pretended to be aggressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that his reputation is well-known, Hudson is also planning to do the same, but he didn't expect to be preempted by his own father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay then, our Viscount Bear Stearns. After the title is finalized, you can also enjoy the title of Viscount in the territory.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stengmo said he was called Viscount, even if he called him Earl or King, no one would care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king of the bear clan of the earth, what does it matter to human beings?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever is full enough to support himself should care about who is the king of the Warcraft race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the other Earth Bears will call the door after receiving this news, no one knows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson feels that the probability of this happening is not high. Just looking at Bear Stearns, if it weren't for his master's hard work to help it become more diligent, this guy would be a useless bear waiting to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few races known for their laziness, but few are as lazy as theirs. Even the laziest Pig in the territory is more diligent than Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What about the territory?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As expected of a bear with a high IQ, he immediately discovered the key to the problem. What's the point of having the title of Viscount without own territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, aren't you an idiot?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone has divided us a new territory, how come I don't know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell you to sleep less and dream less, and now the sequelae are coming. Don't bring things in your dreams into real life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory of the Mountain Territory is still as much as before. Not an inch of land has been added, where can I go to give you territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want it, it's not impossible to discuss it. We can open up wasteland together, and the land developed can also be counted as your share. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson encouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest risk this year is to open up wasteland and start a business. The hills of the Salam Mountains are nothing more than that, and finally they can see the rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As slow as this one is, that's the reward. It is estimated that the newly developed land will be able to pay back its capital in the last 18 years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The endless swampland is purely a huge pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How other people develop the swamp, Hudson doesn't know. Anyway, the silt of more than ten meters at every turn brought a hell-level experience to the development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After more than half a year of tossing, it seems that nearly 10,000 mu of land has been developed, and the manpower and material resources that can be invested are also astronomical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the Marsh brand fertilizer, which helped restore some blood, Hudson doubted whether he could persist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Optimistically, if there is no disaster and twenty years of good weather and good harvests, it will probably be able to pay back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual situation will definitely be worse, and this is a bottomless pit in the short term. With the existing productivity, without using supernatural means, it is a series of projects in the lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Huge investment risks, the pressure to go it alone is too great, and Hudson also had to find a partner who took advantage of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who is wealthy and possesses magical construction capabilities, is undoubtedly the best partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic combined with manpower to open up wasteland, perhaps this is the most correct mode of swamp development. Otherwise, this bottomless pit will drag down the mountain sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no need to open up wasteland, as long as I have dozens of hills to graze, I won't care about you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As he spoke, he seemed to think of something. Bear Stearns, who was originally weak, suddenly became alive and kicking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, as long as you pay on time. Anyway, you know the rent. The southeast province lacks mountains, and things are rare and expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that you really don't think about it anymore?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain areas are not ideal pastoral areas. Once the scale of farming expands, various troubles will arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best place to graze is grassland. The Forgotten Swamp is flat, as long as the water is drained, you can plant grass on it, or you can plant your favorite magic bamboo shoots...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lifespan of the Earth Bear family is thousands of years. With your talent, you may be able to break through the limit and live longer than ordinary Earth Bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, you are less than three years old, and you are at the age of struggle. You can't be decadent so early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, own a pasture of your own, raise tens of thousands of cattle and sheep, have endless animal milk, honey, and endless magic bamboo shoots...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this kind of life, wouldn't countless female bears come to your door to open branches and leaves for you. At that time, you can completely establish your own Earth Bear Dynasty and give birth to a bunch of bear cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pursue a higher level, you can also raise meat monsters. It's the hybrid of those monsters and wild beasts. You have eaten them before, and they taste good, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pie, bigger and bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As he spoke, Hudson was almost lost in the beautiful blueprint he had drawn. The corner of Bear Stearns, who was brought into rhythm, couldn't help drooling at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it takes a long time to develop the swampland, and the risks and benefits are not directly proportional, but considering the long lifespan of the Earth Bear, it seems that the long payback period is not a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How to divide?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he asked, Bear Stearns noticed something was wrong. It seems to have been tricked again, just following Hudson's thinking, and it really didn't find any problems with this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course it is allocated according to the amount of effort! Two cooperation models: the first method, everyone contributes money for development, I contribute labor and technology, and we split the final results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second way, the money is paid by everyone, and the labor force and technology are also paid by everyone, and the final result is directly split 50-50.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think it's fair enough?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't take advantage of you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said brazenly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like there is nothing wrong with it, but it is hard to say when it is actually implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention how to calculate the cost, just the labor and technology, that is a huge pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has a large workforce, Bear Stearns does not. As a bear of the earth, its identity as a monster is destined to prevent it from recruiting troops in the human world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't want me to work as a coolie, do you?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Bear Stearns kept shaking his head. It's okay to do it once in a while, but if you spend decades in land reclamation work, it's just killing your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you thinking, Bear Stearns. Do you think you can do as much work as a bear and be worth more than 20,000 slaves?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything requires skill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You only need to release a spell in the past at a critical moment to assist everyone in the construction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I remember some bears said that their hardening technique can cover a mile and last for half a month, so they are not bragging, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson evaded the important point and said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is only one construction team, then it only takes half a month to cast a spell to solidify the silt on both sides of the ditch, and let the slaves dig the rest of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are more construction teams, and there are more places that need bears. What's more, in the development of the swamp, all kinds of strange creatures need to be dealt with, and bears are also required to contribute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to talk too much about these extra jobs for the time being. As long as Bear Stearns nods, its assets will become project investments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Divestment is impossible, and Hudson will turn the funds on the books into means of production as quickly as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either accept the sunk cost of investment failure, or devote yourself to the cause of land reclamation. Anyway, no matter how you choose, Hudson will not lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These things will all be clarified in a written contract. Don't give bears a chance to play tricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the cubs' emotions, Hudson added again: \"Think about it carefully, this kind of large-scale investment must be cautious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the opportunity is rare, if you miss this time, it will be very difficult for you to meet the second time in your life. But opportunities and risks always coexist, and there is no such thing as a guaranteed profit in this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshland development is also full of risks. In the event of an unexpected situation, or some bears bragging, it may cause the project to lose everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't take the risk, just pretend I didn't say anything. After all, it's all your hard-earned money. If you lose it because you are too lazy, you can't rely on me. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    risk warning!\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The reduced ration supply has also returned to normal levels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autumn plowing has been preserved, as long as the next spring begins, new grain will be put into storage, and the grain shortage in the southeastern provinces can be regarded as over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several families are happy and others are sad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky Baron Cayo, as the saddest frustrated person, is still lying on the hospital bed for self-reflection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he came out of the ivory tower, he suffered the most violent beating from society, which plunged him into deep self-doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles in the north are not having a good time. The disaster is over, but there are still few people selling grain on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While watching a group of local nobles throwing a feast to celebrate the locust plague, they were still anxiously waiting for the king to rescue them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the person responsible for carrying out this order is: Earl Pierce, who regards them as a thorn in his side and a thorn in his flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meetings in the provinces about rescuing noble lords in difficulty were held every now and then, but no results were produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time I go to appeal, I am in a meeting to study it. When the results can be obtained, it depends on the integrity of the bureaucrats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the time pass day by day, everyone's granaries are getting bottomed out day by day, and finally the noble lords can't sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who made the bad start, there are suddenly more people doing business without capital in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, we only picked the teams that transported food, but in the later stage, we would grab the caravans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The chaotic social order further pushed up prices. Not only did it make the business travelers miserable, but also a large number of free citizens in the city went bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to rob, but it is difficult to take away a large amount of loot. Such a big movement naturally attracted the attention of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do-it-yourself robbery is too bad a reputation. But these bandits and robbers were wiped out, and the spoils were legal income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the northern nobles were the most active, and they often arrived at the scene immediately after the incident to eliminate these \"bandits and robbers\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter once or twice, but the situation will change if the number of times increases.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attitude of the lords and nobles in various places is getting worse and worse, and they have expressed strong hostility towards their group of \"bandit extermination activists\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Can't do this anymore!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is a fool, if problems happen one after another, people have already suspected you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of bad luck one day, if someone catches you, things will end badly! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said in a stern tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Respect Baron Sith, we are not like you. If we had a choice, we would not want to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is really no way. The Governor's Mansion made it clear that it was just watching our jokes, and it didn't mean relief at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they won't help, we'll have to figure it out ourselves. Although the method is a bit despicable, there is nothing we can do to prevent the citizens from starving. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has a share in the robbery. Baron Sith can restrain his desire, not because of his strong willpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that they got a lot of food because they started early. The number of slaves in the territory was also reduced, barely able to survive the famine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the other noble children of the Northland were different, and the things they grabbed were not enough to fit their teeth. Stop now at this time, what do you want everyone to eat next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fame is really important, but the prerequisite is to have it. It's a pity that the robbery of business travelers by the nobles of the North is now an open secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It didn't cause the Governor's Office to interfere, that's because their eyes were very bright, and they specially selected some people who were not tough in the background to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aware of this, for the purpose of combating competitors. Many big businessmen with strong backgrounds deliberately activated their personal connections to cover them up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as time went by, things got bigger and bigger, and it became more and more difficult to cover things up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't know the close relationship between you, Baron Kettley, and the Mountain Territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Are you still short of food?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as I know, the mountain baron just purchased a batch of food from the outside world not long ago. Judging from the number of carriages alone, it is at least a million pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is just a purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want, the master behind you will be able to raise tens of millions of pounds of food!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you go to the new owner, there is no need to use old people like us as votes, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith taunted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is really angry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, she would never bring this kind of disappearance to the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats have to have some face, even if the situation is like fire and water, they must restrain themselves on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of practice of turning faces without leaving any room and blocking all room for maneuver is completely inconsistent with the aristocratic style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Sith, those who speak must be responsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you say that I am a traitor, please show evidence for everyone to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, I am afraid that everyone will not feel at ease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no one wants to be convicted without evidence. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he didn't want to confront Baron Sith head-on, but now he was forced into a corner, so he could only bite the bullet and fight hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the name of a traitor must never be recited. Otherwise, there would be no place for him in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Sith, this should be a misunderstanding!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship between Kettler and the Mountain Territory is indeed a little closer, but it is not enough to be a traitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows how deep the grievances between us and the nobles of southern Xinjiang are. This kind of hatred cannot be resolved overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think you have also been in contact with the local nobles, and you know what results have been achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nobles in southern Xinjiang are willing to accept us, the situation will definitely not develop to the present stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone is a traitor, it is to defect to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are both barons, even if the mountain leader is stronger, it is not so strong that everyone has to go to the past. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Calvo said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an ally, he must stand up at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Lord Kettley is kicked out, the fragile balance will be disturbed. Small groups that were already at a disadvantage had even lower voice in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Calvo is right. Although the mountain baron is famous, his background is too low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone sitting here, whose family is not stronger than the Koslow family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reduced to be a bereaved dog of a little nobleman, Hudson's toss has reached the limit now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is hailed by the outside world as the most likely person to become the Sheriff, none of us knows that he has no hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Hudson has all kinds of advantages, it's still not as good as the king's capital!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley is well known to everyone, how could he go to a baron whose potential is exhausted? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked connotation seems to have not mentioned Baron Sith, but in fact, every word of Baron Reno is directed at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, he is belittling Hudson, but in fact he is stepping on Baron Sith. As the son of a grand duke, he couldn't hold back the son of a baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    itself is a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he belittled everyone, everyone didn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in their hearts, everyone has a reason to convince themselves - they are afraid of the Felix family, and they don't want to cause trouble for the family, so they are suppressed by Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from ridiculing, only Baron Reno knew it, and he himself was the one who was not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is no one in the king's capital\", it seems to be talking about Hudson, but it is actually talking about himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ever since he learned that the position of sheriff had been decided in advance, Baron Reno became depressed. Now being dragged into the water by allies, there was a total explosion on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make as much trouble as you like, so let's make trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever caused the incident is responsible for it. Don't let something happen at that time, and you want to drag the alliance into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can't afford to bear this kind of reputation-defamation, and we have no obligation to bear it for some ambitious people! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Baron Sith left in a huff. It seemed that he was really **** off, and he didn't even care about the image of the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was just the faint smile on his mouth, revealing his true thoughts. Winning or losing is not announced until the last moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is certain is that things are really messed up now. It is only a matter of time before the Governor's Office intervenes. If it is to end smoothly, someone must come forward and take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the eldest son of a group of northern Xinjiang nobles, Baron Sith must be to blame for following the normal steps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unwilling to take the blame for his subordinates, he naturally has to take action. Even if there is no such fuse, there will be other excuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous region, Hudson was not only not happy when he received the news of the division among the nobles in northern Xinjiang, but was deeply disappointed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the seemingly split, the Sith Baron was greatly affected. But no matter how great the influence is, it is better than taking the blame for allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crime of \"robbing a business traveler\" is not a big crime, as long as you keep your eyes open and don't offend people who shouldn't be offended, it's the same thing for nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't care about your reputation, even if you are caught, you will lose a sum of money, and the nobles will not die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for Baron Sith, who is vying for the position of sheriff, this stain can pull him down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for the king to appoint a master who has a history of robbing business travelers as the head of a county. Even the grand duke's son is useless, the Alpha Kingdom can't afford to lose him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Baron Sith acted too quickly. When Hudson noticed him, he had already washed his hands and quit, and it was too late to get the stolen goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is an ordinary person, you can also find evidence. But when it comes to the grand duke's son, it will probably be nothing if it is revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one blow fails to kill, then the only option is the next best thing. If it weren't for Hudson's joint efforts with a group of local nobles, it would be just a few big merchants, but they would not be able to suppress the big news of \"robbing business travel\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suppressing the news seems to be helping the nobles of the North to cover up the truth, but in fact they are digging holes, waiting for them to make bigger mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, in an inadvertent moment, they will coincidentally **** something that shouldn't be snatched, and then receive a thunderous blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the net is still being set up, and the biggest fish swims away first, leaving only a group of small fish and shrimp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has never been interested in catching small fish. After slipping away from Baron Sith, the following plan is purely tasteless to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having no time to waste time on \"chicken ribs\", Hudson shifted his focus to territory construction again. The tasks in the second half of the year are very heavy, and the progress delayed by the locust plague still needs to be made up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The development of hilly areas is no different from before. For a better life in \"painting cakes\", the citizens are working hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most advanced farm tools + sufficient livestock + sufficient material supply ensured the smooth progress of land reclamation operations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the first half of the year, two-thirds of the plan to \"open up 100,000 acres of wasteland\" was completed. If it weren't for the delay due to the locust plague, it would be easy to overfulfill the task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Master Hudson pretended not to see the sudden situation of the locust plague. The original plan remains the same, and the rewards are also valid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to take it, just continue rolling!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have been working on it for more than half a year. If I give up now, all my efforts will be for naught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the group of Baojia chiefs, no one wants to be the last. If everyone else is working hard, and the team I lead is the bottom, it will be a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The system worked effectively, and Hudson didn't add anything to the snake. Focused on the development of the swamp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The originally slow progress of the swamp development, after the addition of Uncle Xiong, the progress has been directly increased by ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that Bear Stearns is a bit emotional. The agreed ten days and a half months passed by for a stroll, and it turned out to be almost a permanent construction site.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to appease the \"bear\" heart, Hudson, as a spiritual mentor, also followed the daily **** and supervised the work by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether it is to supervise the work of the slaves or the work of the uncle Xiong, this is not important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that you have entered the pit, it is too late to regret. The cruel reality told Bear Stearns that he could only swallow the cow he had blown out, even if he knocked out his front teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the swamp too pit?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Solidification magic can cover several miles at the same time without any problems, but that is only limited to the surface soil. The mud in the swamp is more than ten meters thick, and the range of magic will naturally shrink.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the speed, Bear Stearns usually needs to cast magic to create a crack in the swamp mud to facilitate the digging by orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What was even worse were the more than 20,000 orcs, divided into more than 200 construction teams, all of which had to be assisted by Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of little lives hidden in the swamp also need Bear Stearns to take care of them. Occasionally, when encountering special terrain and needing magic assistance, Bells can only board it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention being busy all day long, anyway, the cub has never been idle most of the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the mana replenishment speed of the Earth Bear is fast enough, and Hudson is on the side to help open the hang, otherwise it really wouldn't be able to withstand such a toss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the cubs are not strong enough. If they can release the forbidden spell, they can directly smash giant pits in the swamp, connect them together, and create a lake, and the progress of land reclamation can be increased by more than ten times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is just Hudson's fantasy. Not to mention the continuous release of forbidden spells, even the least powerful one can knock down an adult Earth Bear, and it is impossible to recover within a few months of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After wanting to divest several times in a row, Hudson rejected the contract text in black and white. Unwilling to invest in Bear Stearns, which was in vain, he could only work cursing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that interests are touching, even a bear is no exception. Looking at the pieces of land that had been divided, and thinking of his \"Bear Fort Project\", Bear Stearns persisted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The peaceful days passed without any waves every day. Hudson, who was working hard, was finally promoted to a senior knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From junior knight to senior knight, Baron Redman, who lacked resource support, took a full fifteen years, while Hudson took less than two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mysterious compass is the main contributor, but the assistance of cultivation resources also plays a vital role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without these resources, if Hudson wants to make a breakthrough, he will have to spend at least the first half of the year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to knight training, the improvement of magic is faster. After all, he only needs to improve his mental strength, cast magic and hang up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this increase is not unlimited. With the continuous improvement of mental power, the auxiliary effect of medicine will become smaller and smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great magician can barely be regarded as a strong man. If Hudson is willing to register with the Kingdom Magician Corps, he can also receive a salary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong always have privileges. The noble mages can't bear the pain of intensive training, and the training of the mage regiment is also different from that of ordinary troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peaceful times, you only need to be on duty for half a year in five years, and the rest of the time is completely free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the strength is further improved, the rotation period can be shortened. The top powerhouses only need to play during the war, and if they come to work during normal times, they will have to pay extra.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the orc slave found a coal mine while digging the mud. Lord Bear Stearns, please go over to discuss the distribution rights of the coal mine?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom whispered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Discussing the ownership of the coal mine with the lord is undoubtedly a very treacherous thing in his opinion. But if the object of the request is the Earth Bear, then everything is another matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"Greedy Bear\" resounds throughout the Alpha Kingdom. So many people suspect that Bear Stearns has the blood of a dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson also helped the Cubs take the blame. Also, many people suspected that he, the master, ordered it, and the Earth Bear was only the executor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest is so big that there are all kinds of birds. There are many monsters, and there are also all kinds of strange beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are both high-level intelligent races. In the continent of Aslante, the mounts of Warcraft are not slaves, and they also have their own style of behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greedy, gambling, lustful, mischievous, liking... In short, all kinds of monsters with strange hobbies are not uncommon on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can cause controversy, mainly because the image of Bear Stearns is greedy for money, which is completely inconsistent with the positioning of the Earth Bears in people's minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the ceiling of lazy people, there has never been a hardworking bear in the Earth Bear family. Wanting them to work and earn money is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The emergence of Bear Stearns completely broke this law. Not only can you work part-time to earn money, but you can also negotiate prices by yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is further developed, not only talking with outsiders, but even with your own people-\"clearly settle accounts\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Understood, I'll go there right away.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"bear children\" raised by themselves can only suffer by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved once again that it is necessary to fight \"bear children\" as early as possible. If it's too late, you can't win!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is undoubtedly a tragedy. He has always belonged to the side that has been suppressed by force, so that when facing Bear Stearns, he can only reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even coaxing and flicking, finally cultivated a hardworking bear. How about this bear...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't mention it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bears travel thousands of miles to eat meat. If you want bears to work, you can't expect bears to eat grass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finding a coal mine is a good thing after all, but I don't know what coal it is. It was found that in the swamp, there is a high probability that steelmaking cannot be expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems, for Master Hudson who started out selling inferior weapons. The quality of the coal is not really important, as long as it is coal is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can only be based on Bear Stearns' dancing gestures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the mined products, they are mainly peat and some lignite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are common associated mines in swamp areas, no miracles happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Steelmaking is hopeless, but it is good to serve as fuel. The production of low-quality iron is not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the book is in use, you will hate it less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coal washing, Hudson has only heard of it, and knows nothing about how to operate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wash the coal in water?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is too much...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never mind, just arrange someone to try it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coking, not to mention. A pure novice, instead of studying that technology, it is better to buy a set of magic smelting equipment from the Mage Association.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that using this equipment, no matter what fuel is used, the highest quality steel can be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    cost…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is an embarrassing question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was cheap, the price of iron products would have been priced at the price of cabbage, and it would not be Hudson's turn to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the discovery of coal mines is also a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main function of peat is agriculture, which can be regarded as an enhanced version of \"Swamp Brand Fertilizer\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many other functions, but Hudson is temporarily unable to develop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Production of building materials, drilling stabilizers and thinners, raw material regulators for the ceramic industry... are not something that can be produced at the level of technology in the mountainous areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The degree of carbonization of lignite is not enough, but it is still possible to substitute charcoal for iron smelting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What currently restricts the production capacity of raw iron in mountainous areas is the insufficient production capacity of charcoal. Although there is a lot of wood this year, it can't afford to squander every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With lignite that can be mined directly, not only can the production capacity be expanded, but the cost of smelting will be further reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While Hudson was falling into blueprint planning, a bear paw appeared in front of his eyes and dangled back and forth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, what are you messing around? Don't you see that I'm thinking about something? To be a bear, you must have quality.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, a bear greeted him with contempt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's almost done, who doesn't know who!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for my reminder, some people's saliva would almost flow out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of so many slaves, you are not ashamed, but I am also ashamed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without further ado, let me declare that the discovery of this coal mine is due to Ben Xiong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the cub with contempt, Hudson said boldly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, I can't do without you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The income of the coal mine will be shared with you in half. That's all right, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, when will you restrain your petty temper?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, now you are not that poor ghost bear with nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bear with more than a thousand cattle and sheep, and an estate that is about to exceed ten thousand mu, you must learn to be tolerant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry about three melons and two dates all day long, otherwise it will make other bears laugh. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sincerity is \"three melons and two dates\", and the mine boss may not be able to lie down and win.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The geographical location of this coal mine determines that it is difficult to make a profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For hundreds of miles, there is only one buyer, Hudson. If you want to make money, dream about it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as a moral owner, Hudson will not let the coal mine lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the annual dividends will definitely allow bears to eat melons and dates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, a group of agents have come outside to visit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that their goods outside have been robbed, and I would like your help to find them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nick said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he didn't take the agent's robbing as a big deal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all a trade of money and goods, without losing the interests of Master Hudson, so there is no need to care about it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that there were a lot of people coming, he would not have reported at this time for fear of losing customers and affecting the business of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is it our iron products that were robbed, or their other business?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is not the Holy Mother. Doing business these days is inherently high-risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Business being robbed is only a small problem, and those who are unlucky will die directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to meddle in your own business, you can't do it anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if the goods to be robbed are iron products produced by the mountain collar, Hudson will not be able to watch the show. This is going to affect business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such shameless things have never happened since the news that the Earth Bear came of age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Both!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson instantly understood what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A shrewd businessman naturally cannot come to him for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern aristocrats are also not stupid. They know that Mr. Hudson is not easy to mess with, but they still do business with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only explanation is that a smart businessman mixed up the goods in an attempt to deter robbers with Hudson's name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or someone is manipulating behind the scenes, trying to provoke a conflict between him and the nobles of the Northland, and deliberately arranges a good show.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the result is, he must come forward to solve it. Otherwise, future transactions will not be possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell them and wait patiently. There will be results soon. In the recent days, don't go out for the time being.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what role these merchants played in it, it certainly wasn't just an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal for a family to be robbed by mistake, but it is ridiculous if a group of people are robbed by mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that these guys pay quickly and never make trouble, he wouldn't even bother to say these words of comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is rare to be confused in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The water in the business field is too clear, but you can't catch fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you go deeper, you will have no partners. To be an honest partner, it is very difficult to survive in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serious people, who is in the arms business!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the matter got to this point, it was obvious that a group of merchants were forced to have no choice but to come up with such a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe not only him, some powerful nobles in other provinces also act as lobbyists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at it from another angle, it means that the time to close the net is approaching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the window paper is pierced, it will not only be the nobles of the two counties who have a stake in it, but also the local nobles in other regions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know if the nobles of the North have grabbed enough food for the winter, or else they will lose a lot in this wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor's Palace, magic photo stones appeared in front of Earl Pierce as evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanying them to watch, there are also a group of bureaucrats in the southeastern province. It's just that the style of painting is a little abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this kind of bad things inside the nobles, everyone who should have become angry from embarrassment, but laughed and talked nonsense, and commented on the acting skills of the nobles in the Northland from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this scene gets out, it may immediately cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emotionally everyone's painstaking planning and game result, in the eyes of these old men, is just a big drama for comment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"These merchants are still willing to spend their money. They even took out the rare picture stones. It seems that they are really being bullied.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tax officer said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a bureaucrat stationed by the king in the southeastern province, Earl Simic is not a local nobleman, and is completely a spectator in this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, as an outsider, he has to collect the full amount of taxes every year. In addition to routinely selling taxation rights to nobles, dealing with merchants is also indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This process is obviously not very beautiful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Few businessmen like to pay taxes, and tax evaders and tax collectors will inevitably have to fight wits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although as a tax officer, he was rich in money, it didn't affect Earl Simic's distaste for these guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, most nobles look down on merchants in their bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ninety-nine percent of the land in the southeastern province was entrusted to noble lords, but the control of some prosperous cities was still in the hands of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the central government is strong, these places are directly under the jurisdiction of the kingdom; when it is weak, they are controlled by local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Undoubtedly, when encountering a powerful monarch like Caesar III, the tax collector still has some say in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is indeed enough for them. But just to teach them a lesson, lest they live too comfortably and comfortably, and make them forget who is the master of this world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little guys below are almost making a fuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the noble children of the Northland were recorded by the photo stone. The winner of this struggle has already been decided, so there is no need to wait any longer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Simic, why don't you hand it over to His Majesty the King? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce said with a complicated expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the children of the local nobles did a good job this time. In addition to helping to suppress the news, the rest is to encourage the businessmen to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the content recorded by these photo stones will be broadcast to the world in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles, that bad reputation will become even more notorious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For many families, the loss of family reputation far exceeds that of a fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This fierce attack also hides itself behind the scenes. The maturity of the political means shown is enough to impress everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no children of the Dalton family appeared in such a wonderful performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a big family, the rise and fall is no longer limited to the gains and losses of one city and one place. What is more important is whether future generations can produce talents in large numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cayo, who has high hopes, shows a really good political vision. Unfortunately, being able to see through does not mean being able to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking clearly and logically, analyzing problems can also hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately, the first time I practiced, I was hit hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe many suffer a few times and grow up in the future, but that is only a possibility after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem of high-sightedness and low-handedness is not so easy to solve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nephew is weak, and the son is too young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the age of thirteen or fourteen, when he was in the second grade, Earl Pierce did not dare to let him out of society so early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the descendants of the direct line, there is actually a talent window period. For a big family, this is not a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, too few births. The previous generation had few heirs, and the only brother died young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this generation, Earl Pierce worked hard to cultivate, and the ending was even more unsatisfactory. Not only did the harvest come late, but the yield was only one seedling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that there are too few sons, he would not work hard to raise nephews.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for collateral descendants, there is no shortage of them. The quality is mostly the capital of the middleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being willing to spend a lot of money, there is still value in cultivation. If you don't want to spend your money to pay tuition, you can only lose sight of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also one of the reasons why the Dalton family pays attention to eating, try to deal with problems within the rules, and avoid making enemies everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population is thin and can't stand the toss. If you play too high, it is easy to go wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the same family, Earl Pierce is unwilling to see the collateral branch grow bigger and the family fortune fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you should handle this kind of matter yourself! As a tax official, I cannot exceed my authority.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Simic waved his hand and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The conflict between the northern and southern feudal nobles, he, the earl of the court, is too weak and has no capital to participate in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to offend people by showing up at this time. In case the nobles of the North land put the account on his head, wouldn't it be wronged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, all the local nobles looked at each other and smiled. Although he doesn't say it, the contempt in his heart is indeed indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with court nobles, the advantages of fief nobles are too great. Even though Earl Simic is in a high position now, all the glory comes from the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless you make great achievements, it is possible to complete your identity turn. However, this change will most likely be downgraded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the early years of the founding of the country, every great noble after the rise must not only have sufficient strength, but also must have the credit for saving the kingdom from danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are far from Count Simic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to looking forward to such a small probability event, it is better to serve the king for generations and enjoy power and wealth with the help of the king's power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least Earl Simic can sit here and chat happily with everyone, no matter what other people think in their hearts, they will never show it on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Simic, you are still so humble. Who doesn't know that you are the king's right-hand man and are most trusted by His Majesty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since your Excellency doesn't like to get involved in these **** things, we won't force it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military officer, the task of catching the murderer is entrusted to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides the boys from the Northland, I arrested all the rest of the robbers who appeared on the photo stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If necessary, local nobles can be recruited to cooperate. If these guys dare to resist, they will be killed on the spot!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for how to deal with these bastards, just wait for the ruling of the kingdom's noble council! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crime of robbing a business traveler is not fatal to nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when it comes to those difficult guys from the Northland, it is even more difficult to beat them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the noble council, there is a high probability that it will still be a joke. The only value is to embarrass the nobles of the North, and then try to reach out to his back garden. This is the best reason for rejection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everyone is in the circle of nobles, and Earl Pierce doesn't want to do anything wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking these guys' subordinates now is not only reducing the strength of the northern nobles in the southeastern province, but also leaving room for the opponent to maneuver.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lost face will definitely not be regained. But if you have a thicker skin, you can still cover it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throwing the blame on these unlucky guys, although unsatisfactory and hard to believe, is better than directly admitting that your own children led the team to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles themselves are a group of hypocritical guys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, even if you know you are deceiving yourself, you still have to act.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If the nobles in the southeastern province hadn't brought the lawsuit to the capital, Caesar III wouldn't have had time to pay attention to such trivial matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I thought that the big thing would be reduced to a small one, and if the small matter was reduced, it would be over if the responsible person was dealt with in a low-key manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current wave of public opinion has directly revealed the matter. The incident has spread from the parties to the entire northern noble group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a political strongman, Caesar III could tell at a glance that someone was deliberately provoking trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"According to the investigation data, these ripped photo stones were all lost from the hands of a businessman named Philip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that our investigators were a step too slow. When they went to find it, the building was already empty, and only a few peripheral miscellaneous fish were caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have collected very little information about Philip. This person seems to have popped up out of nowhere, and there is no other information other than spreading photo stones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the surrounding neighbors, none of them knew this person. We're not even sure if the name is real or not. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland bit the bullet and explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he, the prime minister, didn't work hard, but it happened suddenly. No one expected this scene to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many suspected forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are dozens of domestic and foreign companies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to check, you don't know how to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What did Earl Pierce say?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is venting his anger on others, it's just that the disturbance is not going to end well, and he must come up with a result as soon as possible to suppress the heat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The incident was detonated from the southeast province. Whether he wanted it or not, Earl Pierce was passively involved in the vortex of the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Governor Pierce's opinion is: only deal with the following specific executors, in order to quell public anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the noble children involved in this matter, he suggested not to deal with it directly in order to minimize the impact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If necessary, the southeastern province will announce the results of the investigation to the outside world, claiming that people from the Skull and Bones Society pretend to be these nobles to do evil. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the prime minister's words, Caesar III's anger eased a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of explanation, although it cannot be hidden from those who are interested, is a reliable solution after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just do it according to his opinion. But it can't be called pretending. This kind of rhetoric is too difficult to be convincing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Announced to the outside world that the Skull and Bones used evil methods to control these nobles to do evil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, increase the intensity of the arrest of the Skull and Bones, let the nobles of the Northland find their own way, and come up with substantive evidence that the Skull and Bones did it! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem like this changes the narrative, but the end result is something else entirely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Being pretended to be\" means that this matter has nothing to do with the children of the nobles of the Northland, and there is no need to bear any responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Evil law control\", although it can also escape being held accountable, but with such a hat, the way forward will be cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An aristocrat who has been controlled by a cult organization, no one can guarantee that he will come again, and he is destined to be unable to take on important tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, being able to be controlled by a cult in the continent of Aslante is equated with being weak-willed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It runs counter to the mainstream chivalry and aristocratic spirit. Not only is the development path blocked, but it will also be despised in future life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the changes in the southeastern provinces were mainly caused by the friction of interests between the children of the northern nobles and the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this problem is not resolved, no one can guarantee that similar incidents will occur in the future. Why not just take this opportunity and solve it together! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero proposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Minister of Military Affairs, he remained neutral most of the time to the political struggles within the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is different now. Seeing that the northern land is filled with gunpowder, it is only a matter of time before the orcs invade the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this juncture, the Alpha Kingdom must be united.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, once the war breaks out, it will be the beginning of disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing an enemy like the orcs, there is no room for relaxation. In essence, we are all in the same boat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced in the direction of northern Xinjiang, and after sighing, Caesar III said thoughtfully:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This matter, the prime minister can figure it out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decision of the capital is still on the way, but the two counties of Wyton and Wright exploded first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor's mansion's large-scale acquisition of people, but without keeping it secret, soon caused an uproar in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the misfortune of one family after another of the nobles, the children of the northern nobles who participated in the robbery panicked instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many unlucky people, except for himself, all the troops under his command were arrested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one tried to organize a rebellion, but the fate of the rebels was really miserable. Not only were all his subordinates killed, but even the lord himself was beaten up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army responsible for carrying out the arrest task all brought chaplains with them, who specially treated these restless nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Injuries with missing arms and broken legs can be recovered instantly. As long as you dare to resist, people will dare to do black hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only criterion is—undead nobles on site. They don't care about all the sequelae.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the local aristocrats who cooperated with the past, it is even more revenge and revenge, and the behavior is so bad that it is too difficult to write.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At such a time, Baron Sith, who is the backbone of the nobles of the Northland, unexpectedly announced to thank guests behind closed doors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, are you really missing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Butler Faerun asked hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith stopped early, and no evidence of the stone hammer was found. It is indeed a good choice to protect himself wisely at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are too many northern nobles involved, except for a few lucky ones who escaped the record of the photo stone, most of the participants were unfortunately arrested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's meaningless, the handle has fallen into the hands of the enemy. If the Governor's Mansion wants to take advantage of this opportunity, no one can stop it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We get involved and we don't help anyone but ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I should remind you beforehand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the nobles who were close to us hid in the past. What does the life and death of others have to do with me?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our finishing work is not so neat, no one cares about it. If it is investigated, the situation will also be difficult to clean up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it really mixes too much and angers the Governor's Mansion, it may not be impossible for us to do it together. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most fearful thing in everything is to be true, and the face of my father is not easy to use here. If people don't investigate deeply, it is due to the unspoken rules among the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, every family has younger generations who are not worried. When you encounter some problems, you cling to them to death. Isn't it true that the children of the N generation are not living a good life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people don't pursue it, it doesn't mean that he can die indefinitely. If he sent it to the door by himself and was cleaned up by others, even Grand Duke Kavadia would not be able to say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at his young master, Butler Fei Lun hesitated to speak. This time, what I did was unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, they just sit idly by and watch everyone die, but secretly they are taking the opportunity to eliminate dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the maple leaf collar, Baron Kettley is welcoming the inquiries of the arresting army with an expression of a dead pig not afraid of boiling water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem in wanting to arrest someone, he fully cooperates with the action, but the prerequisite is to produce evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He took the picture stone and compared it over and over again, and was surprised to find that none of the soldiers in the territory could match up with the soldiers who participated in the robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone hadn't seen it, the convoy entered the Maple Leaf collar after the successful robbery, and almost fooled it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Baron Kettley, please tell the truth, where are the rest of your soldiers and the supplies you robbed?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron McNamee asked sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many diehards were planted in his hands. But this time was an exception, the main force of the Maple Leaf Territory was not there at all, and only serf soldiers in armor remained in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who participated in the robbery must not be serf soldiers. Caravans these days are not soft persimmons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, what are you talking about? All the soldiers of my Maple Leaf collar are here, where are the other soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must have read it wrong, maybe some unscrupulous nobleman sent someone to impersonate. You should go look elsewhere, lest the real culprit escape. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately's words of treating people as fools completely angered Baron McNamee, who was on the arrest mission.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the key perpetrators hadn't been caught, Kettley couldn't handle it. He had to let the guy in front of him know that the investigators couldn't be messed with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Your Excellency said so, don't regret it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the governor is magnanimous and intends to give you a lighter sentence, but it will not be so simple later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After uttering a harsh word, Baron McNamee turned around and left with the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The murderer ran away without even finding the stolen goods, so there was no question of conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuing to stay and entangle is meaningless except to increase the jokes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, he wrote down the account first. Once the opportunity arises in the future, he will definitely come to liquidate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After narrowly escaping, Baron Kettley's face showed no joy at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sensing that the limelight was wrong, before the Governor's Office reacted, he asked his subordinates to pretend to be laborers to transport goods to the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the army can hide away for a while by sneaking away, but they can't hide for a lifetime. Once they return to the southeast province, old accounts will still be revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sith, if you really did this. Then we all underestimated you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea of ​​doubt, just born, lingered in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shortly after Baron Sith reminded, the picture stone recording the robbery popped up. It just happened that his cronies escaped, and those who suffered heavy losses were those who did not buy him in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old opponent, Kettley has never really taken the second-generation Baron Sith seriously. But the current situation made him have to re-examine his opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this turmoil, the children of the northern nobles suffered heavy losses, but this fragmented alliance has emerged as a dominant family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The losers are ruined, not only will their future development be frustrated, but even their survival will be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength in their hands has been greatly damaged, and the family behind them is beyond their reach. If they want to keep this foundation in their hands, the only choice left for them is to find a backer to rely on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local aristocrats couldn't integrate into it for a while, and there was no way to join them. Baron Sith naturally became the only choice for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sacrificing the strength of the unstable elements in the alliance in exchange for control of the entire alliance, this deal is obviously a bargain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the principle that whoever benefits is the biggest suspect, Kettley has enough reasons to suspect that this is the work of Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a suspicion, but at the moment he can't do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he doesn't know what the final outcome will be, he can be sure that the northern nobles in the two counties will only be respected by Baron Sith in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to refuse to accept. The strength of the opponents has been severely damaged, and they are no longer able to compete with the Sith for the right to speak in the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in order to survive, many people were forced to seek refuge in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous region, Hudson, who was sitting and watching the situation, no longer looked at the children of the Northland nobles whose strength had been damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting from the network collection plan, the subsequent plot is out of his control. Facts have proved that the thinking of the big shots above is really different from what he expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The robbery incident, which was supposed to be handled lightly, directly ruined the future of half of the northern nobles in the two counties because of an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, for ordinary nobles, this level of social death is not completely unacceptable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Alpha Kingdom where the class is severely solidified, every step forward is full of difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the feudal nobles find it difficult to make a leap to the upper echelon in their lifetime, but it is very easy to slide down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for some ambitious guys, this is the biggest disaster, and you can imagine how much resentment these guys will accumulate in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where this resentment will eventually be vented is unknown for the time being, anyway, hidden dangers are buried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, go back to your hometown and hand over this letter to Baron Redman.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has two sides, and the subordinates show mercy to the northern nobles, so the kingdom must appease the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the spokespersons for the interests of the local nobles, Hudson is undoubtedly able to enjoy this wave of political dividends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to trap Baron Sith, but created an opportunity for him to integrate the nobles of the Northland. Naturally, Hudson did not have the position of Sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, the Dalton family came forward to operate the Viscount position for him, but now there is basically no suspense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The promotion of the title, especially the promotion of the title of the fief nobles, every step is extraordinary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially this symbolic promotion can be called a class leap, and it is of great significance to any family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is no longer a personal matter for Hudson, but has risen to the level of the entire Koslow family. Correspondingly, the preparatory work that needs to be done has also increased a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many messy things, Hudson doesn't want to get himself into it. If you have this spare time, it is better to work hard to improve your strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't want to do it, but someone was willing to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the father of a five-year-old, Baron Redman has long passed the golden period of cultivation, and the ancestral territory has nothing to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this age, the low-level nobles who have not yet climbed up are no longer competing for careers, but for the younger generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the father has a need, the son can only cooperate. There is absolutely nothing wrong with entrusting this kind of showy scene to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify in advance, and prepare the preparations, so as to save time and make jokes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, in recent days, the slaves in the territory have been attrition somewhat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone has sold orc slaves recently, do you want to take the opportunity to purchase a batch at a low price as a supplement? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was Luke who was in charge of the swamp reclamation work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was originally a businessman, but unfortunately he went bankrupt during the previous looting of the nobles of the Northland, so he defected here in order to avoid his creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson, who has a good ability and is seriously lacking in talents, promoted a land reclamation supervisor on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that when it comes to squeezing methods, businessmen are more professional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With one more person in charge, the development progress of the swamp has increased by 40% again, but the corresponding loss of slaves is also increasing day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said bluntly that every mu of developed swamp is full of blood and tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the benevolent Master Hudson who really couldn't see it and intervened, the speed could be even faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kindness is kindness, Luke is still in the position of the person in charge, and has become Master Hudson's right-hand man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Those Northland guys can't hold on so soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, everyone has secretly contacted about the issue of the orc slave trade before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the gap between the expectations of the two sides is too large. Hudson, who is only willing to pay the price of potatoes, cannot satisfy everyone's appetite at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show their indomitability, a group of northern nobles even committed atrocities to artificially reduce the population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these things don't scare Master Hudson. Anyway, the orc slaves who are disposed of are not his property, so there is no need to worry about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, it is said that because of the poor food, the orc slaves led by Tago started a riot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the rebellion was quickly suppressed by the nearby noble lords, the Tigerland still suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a fit of anger, Knight Justin executed all the remaining orc slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after killing someone, he regretted it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luke said gloatingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slave rebellion in Tigerland was no accident. As one of the main participants in the robbery incident, the soldiers in Justin's hands naturally failed to escape the fate of being arrested by the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With no soldiers in hand, the orc slaves who were originally valuable labor force naturally became the biggest security risk in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a fuse is lit, the mine explodes directly. Seeing the unlucky situation of Knight Justin, the other northern nobles naturally felt lingering fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of keeping the mine in your hand, not knowing when it will explode, it is better to sell it as soon as possible, and you can exchange some gold coins to make up for the loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only regret is that there are too few buyers and there is no room for choice. After turning around, I still could only find Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally part of the plan. At this time, Hudson will naturally not be polite to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell them, I'll give you thirty pounds of potatoes for every strong ratman slave, fifty pounds for tauren slaves, kobolds...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cut the original offer in half, and Hudson reported it directly. As for whether the northern nobles accept it, it doesn't really matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The forest is big and there are all kinds of birds. Not every noble in the Northland has the capital of toughness, and there will always be compromises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you can sell some food in exchange for some food. If there is a slave riot, it will be nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The soldiers who participated in the robbery were all sent to the front line in northern Xinjiang, and they were not allowed to be released for life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, this is a result acceptable to all parties. Including Skull and Bones, which has been blamed, did not express any objection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it's because the debts are too high, or maybe it's because the pots are smashed and smashed, anyway, Hudson hasn't heard anything about the Skull and Bones recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one who is not reconciled is probably a group of business travelers who have been robbed. The murderer was caught, and all the lost goods disappeared miraculously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to be unwilling. As the group with the least voice, they have never had a voice in politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really dare to make a fuss, you can find a hundred reasons to take them down if you just check their past transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Profitable merchants\", the two words are not called for nothing. Legally traded, that's pure high-risk hard-earned money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really keep yourself safe, you will never want to make a lot of money in your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing went wrong, it was a transaction of most merchants, and there were nobles behind it supporting them, or they could be related to the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some big merchants have more energy than small and medium nobles. Even in front of the big nobles, he can have some face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if you hang out with the nobles for a long time, and you regard yourself as a nobleman, that is the beginning of disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is an example. Even if a group of merchants mobilized all their energy, they failed to obtain satisfactory results in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The answer given by the governor's office failed to satisfy them, and the answer given by the kingdom was even more nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if there was no such thing, a wanted warrant against Skull and Bones, plus a personnel appointment to add fuel to the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old rebel organization, Skull and Bones' wanted warrants have been hanging in the Alpha Kingdom for hundreds of years, adding another one will not change anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appointment of personnel is not only dissatisfied with the merchants, but also a group of local nobles, including Hudson, who also expressed strong dissatisfaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Baron of Cayo as Sheriff of Wytonshire\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Baron of Sith Succeeded as Sheriff of Wrightshire\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has been fighting for so long, but in the end, the two second generations took away all the fruits of victory. No one would be happy when something like this happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Hudson himself getting a viscount position, which slightly made up for the political loss, the position of spokesperson for the interests of the local aristocracy might not be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't blame everyone for reality, it's just that the world is too cruel. It is too difficult for the little nobles to counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others seem to be complaining for Hudson, but in fact they are more venting their inner unwillingness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of many people, if they were born in Sith or Kayo, with such resource blessings, they could do better than them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the vortex, Hudson can only say: the truth!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the two counties, there are indeed quite a few nobles who are no less capable than the two of them. Unfortunately, some of the gaps can't be made up without hard work the day after tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the two mess up, as long as they make waves, the family behind them will be willing to pay for their tuition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the children of other small and medium nobles are not good. Their lives do not allow any mistakes, and a small mistake can make all their efforts go to waste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's useless not to be reconciled, the noble world doesn't believe in tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, Hudson quickly recovered. There is still a long way to go in life, and temporary gains and losses are nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Misfortune, blessing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the position of sheriff, he seemed to be at a disadvantage in this battle, but it also saved him a lot of trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's appointment is just a matter of righteousness and righteousness. Whether the position of the sheriff can be deserved depends on their methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the situation in Wyton County, if Baron Sith wants to control Wright County, it depends on whether Hudson is willing to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made Baron Sith unlucky?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two viscounts in one county. This kind of thing is nothing new in the Alpha Kingdom, but most of them are empty viscounts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fief viscounts who are not county guards are rare in the entire continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once this happens, the authority of the Sheriff's Office is bound to be seriously challenged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be suppressed depends entirely on the strength of the county guard's family and personal means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith's backstage is naturally strong enough, but the problem is that the fist he met, Master Hudson, is not too weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The father of the Grand Duke who is far away in the north has limited face in the southeastern province, and the power of the Felix family in the southern border is not enough to make Hudson bow his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not because he is greedy for power, but because he is in the aristocratic circle and cannot help himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the spokesperson for the interests of the local nobles in the county, everyone has this appeal for him to fight. How can Hudson back down?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't just enjoy the benefits, but don't want to take responsibility, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An irresponsible boss, why let the younger brothers follow along?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of these people, Hudson would not be where he is today. It seems that his rise was a coincidence and his own struggle. In fact, the local nobles also made great efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, the famous name is made by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there was a shortage of supplies and needed to be exchanged, no local nobles took advantage of the fire to rob them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may seem inconspicuous, but at critical moments, it can play an important role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for these strong supports, why would Hudson dare to take over the orc slaves at this time of failure?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking everyone's interests, it is natural to safeguard everyone's interests. At least until the interests run counter to each other, this kind of cooperation will not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he failed to seize the position of Sheriff, the celebration will continue. The more you lose, the more confident you have to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific celebration ceremony does not need Hudson to worry about. After receiving his letter, Baron Redman rushed over to make arrangements without stopping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other branches in the province have also sent people to help one after another, and people from outside the province are also on the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the enthusiastic faces of the clansmen, Hudson suspected that this celebration was not for himself, but for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passion is always better than no passion. Although the Koslow family has declined, after all, the ancestors still had a glorious time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time to reflect the background. There are many hidden things. Looking through the database of each branch can still provide some references.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that there was no ability. Now, Hudson has to do something to contribute to the development of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, it is unrealistic to integrate the Koslow family. Each branch has been separated for hundreds of years, and has already formed its own system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the ancestral land can be regained, there is the righteousness of rejuvenating the family, and the agreement reached by each branch, otherwise it is impossible for each branch to be a younger brother willingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it is still possible to further consolidate the internal relationship of this family-style alliance, gather knowledge and materials accumulated by various branches, and increase internal communication activities among family members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Introduction, this thing is not only reflected in strength, but also in the accumulation of knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when everyone exchanged knowledge, they could only exchange knowledge on a small scale. Concentrating the knowledge reserves of each branch and sharing knowledge achievements is even more unthinkable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't know the benefits of doing this, but because of their own strength, no one can afford the risk of causing prying eyes from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation is different now. The heritage of the Koslow family is not enough for the nobles to **** it regardless of their face. I don't know how much they have piled up in their warehouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prying eyes of small and medium nobles are no longer a problem for the mountain territories. One Earth Bear + two elite infantry regiments are enough to scare them off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is an additional platform for exchange and learning. In the future, adult children of all branches will inevitably come and learn more knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as people come over, Hudson doesn't worry about not being able to carry private work. As long as the next generation is recovered, the thoughts of the old men above are actually not important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Direct children can take their time. Hudson has a lot of patience. In a short time, he can start with collateral children first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for a group of distant disciples who lack cultivation resources, a piece of life essence can be exchanged for them to come and work for ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson has a dark heart. In fact, if this kind of treatment is spread, some people from the outside world will rush in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Knights\" of the major forces were formed in this way. Many people have signed harsh and unequal treaties for a piece of life essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, there are still many people who can't grab it. For many big forces, instead of raising too many cannon fodder knights, it is better to cultivate cheaper \"warriors\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One part is incomplete, only the fighting qi cultivation method in the front part is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivation resources do not matter, and no one teaches the specific process of cultivation. How many qualified fighters can be born depends purely on their luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cast a wide net and there will always be a harvest. You don't need to cultivate your grudge very well, as long as the base is large enough, you can cultivate an army with extraordinary strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also following suit, but unfortunately the harvest has not been ideal. Even if the base is expanded, there are still very few geniuses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is also the reason why the extraordinary army is scarce. Even if the great nobles can gather an extraordinary army of thousands of people, it has a deep foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does not dare to hope to form an extraordinary army now, but it is still necessary to make the army under his command more elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are qualified soldiers, and now there are only qualified officers. Serf soldiers who have not learned any knowledge can manage a hundred and eighty people well, which is almost the limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they have experienced hundreds of battles and experienced the test of life and death on the battlefield, it is too embarrassing to expect them to lead troops to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not just about talent, it's mainly about acquired education, which makes them used to listening to the lord, and they don't want to use their brains when encountering things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talent is rare. Most of the family children who came over last time stayed, and were tricked by Hudson into the army to hone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ability levels of the children of the family are also uneven, but after all, they are much stronger than serfs, and their upper limit of development potential is much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he knows that the army of disciples is a double-edged sword, and the large-scale use of family disciples can easily form a closed faction, Hudson doesn't care so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The troubles of inbreeding and grouping of interests are things of the future. If we don't strengthen our military strength first, if the orc empire comes over, we might not even see the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aftermath will not be discussed until later, anyway, Hudson now needs an army with high loyalty and strong combat effectiveness to cope with the next changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, the invitations are all ready. Take a look and see what else you can invite, and don't miss some important people.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman exhorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Status determines the circle. When he was just a fledgling, he was with the lowest-level knights with Hudson, and it was very difficult to make friends with a few barons occasionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By now, Hudson has half a foot into the \"high society\" of the southeastern province. Although he doesn't have much contact with nobles of the same level, he knows a lot of strong people!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last battle against locusts, Hudson was not in vain. The group of strong men who participated in the operation basically have a familiar face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, this kind of friendship was nothing, but Bear Stearns' \"adulthood\" made him once again have an impressive capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not sure about the others. Even if I don't come in person after sending out the invitation, the representative will definitely send one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, almost all the influential forces in the province were included.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this ostentatious display of connections must have political significance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's goal is very clear, that is to create an illusion to the outside world that all the powerful factions in the southeastern province are supporting him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in this way, the younger brothers who follow him will have enough confidence to keep going. It's unlikely that one day the Felix family will directly persuade them to go back after making a statement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scanning the invitation quickly, Hudson smiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry, father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These invitations have invited all the large and medium-sized forces in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are still omissions, it must be that this force is too weak and lacks a sense of presence. It doesn't hurt to miss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will personally receive the important guests on the list. Leave the rest to Nelson and Evora, and there will be no trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly from the family side, the people who came this time may be a bit complicated, so you need to pay more attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many declining branches, and now there is not even a knight. At that time, it will be easy to be ignored in the reception arrangement. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson looks down on people, it's that the continent of Aslante is strictly hierarchical. If guests of different identities are arranged together, everyone will feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reception work is doomed to be divided into grades. At this time, the benefits of a thriving population can be reflected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the principle of reciprocity, Hudson will greet the most distinguished guests in person. The rest of the guests can be left to the brothers to be responsible for receiving them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are people from the family, and Baron Redman is there to catch up with them. Even the female relatives who refer to the celebration have their married sisters rushing back to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the cheap stepmother, there is no chance to show up on this occasion. It's all determined by status, no matter how unwilling you are, you can only stay in your hometown and hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pillow wind is useless. Baron Redman dare not be negligent in this important matter involving the face of the entire Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with Baron Redman's emphasis, Hudson is more relaxed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was due to the confidence brought about by his strength, he didn't have much thought about this special celebration banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet is only on the surface. In essence, everyone's ability to come to support is still a value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson dared to send out invitations like this a year ago, he guessed that people could use them directly as a match.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson had followed Hudson's idea and held it directly in the temporary lord's mansion, the celebration banquet would have started long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay until now is mainly due to Baron Redman's insistence that he can't make do with it so casually, and must make a grade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, the temporary lord's mansion with several cabins is obviously out of reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the construction progress of the castle was not as good as expected. Even if it was a temporary rush period, the celebration time was forced to be delayed by one month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is Hudson's fault. He does not pay enough attention to castle construction on weekdays, and gives priority to investing labor in mines and land reclamation that can create wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it was time to use it, I realized that the construction of the castle, which had been under construction for a year, hadn't even finished the main project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't until Baron Redman arrived in the Mountain Territory that Hudson was persuaded, and a large amount of labor was allocated to the construction of the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to meet the deadline, Hudson even fooled Bear Stearns over. The price paid was that in the planning of the Lord's Mansion, a bear castle had to be built according to the will of the cub.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These years of construction are all based on local materials. The cost is mainly labor, but this one is mainly eating and drinking, and a small amount of rewards for the artisans who host the project.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, it is still negligible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson agreed so readily, the main reason is that Bear Stearns is a wood turtle who has never seen big scenes. The so-called castle is a big hole with the unique aesthetics of bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the aesthetics and practicality, the key is the low cost. A pile of rocks and wood, and you're done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The decorative carving, which should be the most costly, was directly ignored by Bear Stearns because of its different aesthetics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bears in the family don't care, so Hudson will naturally not add to the snake. The simple bear castle is good, if you are not satisfied, you can continue to modify it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that when the time comes, it's all Bear Stearns' own business, and he doesn't need to pay for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing in the direction of Dardir City, he threw away the invitation, and Hudson shook his head disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the invitation card is here, isn't it a demonstration?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Baron Sith does have the capital to win now. After going through so many twists and turns, he finally defeated all the competitors and won the victory of the county guard. It really needs to be celebrated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the world of nobility, everyone only looks at the result, the process is not important.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the proud Sith Baron, the current Hudson is a complete loser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you get the position of Viscount. Compared with the real shortage of the sheriff, Hudson's viscount position is purely a title, and the actual benefits are not seen at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Call back to Viscount Sith, I will attend his celebration banquet on time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The celebration banquet for Kayo and Sith was held on the same day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is worrying for the nobles of the neutral camp. No matter which party they attend, they will offend the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, everyone can only choose to pretend to be sick, and play out of courtesy until no one can be seen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson also fell ill together. Although he said before that he would participate, it was just a polite remark, so how could he take it seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Running to see competitors pretending to be aggressive, to cause trouble for himself for no reason, and his mind is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the invitation is just to be polite, and they don't necessarily want Hudson to come and join him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is meaningless to do things. It's not a life-and-death enmity, why bother to disturb other people's celebration banquet?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles must have tolerance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you stab each other secretly, there is no need to turn your face on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if you mess up my banquet today and I mess up your ceremony, wouldn't all the banquets be turned into farces?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prepared two gifts and sent them to them respectively, Hudson turned his attention back to the construction of his castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No new tricks were played. Except for the modification of the details, the overall castle design still follows the local architectural style, which is somewhat Gothic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the location of the castle, you can tell that it stands on Salam Peak, the highest peak in the southeastern province, obviously putting defense first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is Hudson's planning, which is much larger than ordinary castles, and the main building covers an area of ​​1 hectare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the surrounding ancillary buildings, it is a city. The area enclosed by the city wall is 3.8 square kilometers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all the projects are completed, it will be a war fortress that can accommodate tens of thousands of people, and it will compete with Fort Ethel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a baron wants to build a war fortress before this, it will definitely cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it would be much more normal to switch to a fief viscount. Almost all fief viscounts will build their own cities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Dadir City, where the Viscount Sith is located, is the result of the former noble lords' own management.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom will only allocate funds to build cities in the northern border to resist the orc invasion, and ignore other areas at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no human country will invade the Alpha Kingdom. This is a tacit understanding among countries on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by financial resources and manpower, generally speaking, the construction of noble castles takes a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three to five years is the norm, and ten to eight years is not surprising. It is also possible to plan grandly and continue to build for generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has been working on it for a year, and the Lord's Mansion has not been completed, which is also within the normal level of everyone's perception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of Bear Stearns, the speed of all this has become faster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is more difficult for ordinary people to transport huge boulders weighing several tons or tens of tons than moving forward with snails.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be placed on Bear Stearns, and it is almost like playing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Boulders weighing several tons or tens of tons are toys in the hands of the cubs. For a while, I played a game of tossing the ball, and for a while, I spun around my head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One piece is not addictive, and several boulders can be connected in series to play together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns acrobatic performance is also a unique landscape in the mountainous area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman, who was looking at it, was terrified, lest the Earth Bear would get too excited and hit people with boulders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this situation did not last long. The number of boulders is limited, and the highly efficient Bear Stearns completed the delivery of the boulders in less than a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The stones are all prepared in advance, which has to make people think carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Xiong didn't say anything, so the others naturally wouldn't talk too much. It is impossible for Hudson or Bear Stearns to talk about the transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A decent person + a decent bear = tacit confidentiality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of everyone's glorious image, everything that involves interests must be kept secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one made trouble, and the celebration banquets on both sides were very successful, but there were fewer guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, a celebration banquet is similar to a wedding. Except for the parties concerned, everyone only pays attention to it superficially.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the parties involved do not necessarily pay attention, such as Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being dragged down by the construction of the castle, his celebration banquet has not yet started, and the season for spring grain storage has already arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing the locust plague last year, the harvest of spring grain this season is extremely important for the two counties of Wright and Wyton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless territories are waiting to be fed, just waiting for the food to go into the pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, some northern aristocratic territories even used green wheat to satisfy their hunger in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the variety of food is too single, all of which are within the scope of the locust's diet, and it is pale and powerless in the face of the locust plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is ready to play diversified agriculture, and poultry must be raised to suppress the flood of locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no market for chickens and ducks these days, large-scale breeding cannot sell them, but this does not affect their own food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aquaculture can also be arranged on. The ditches and rivers dug out of the swamp are natural breeding grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, these days, there is no pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and everything is original.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to demand extravagant output, no matter how much you harvest, you can earn money. Increasing the supply of meat is also a powerful measure to solve the shortage of food production capacity in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the army, adequate nutrition is the key to a strong army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't even fill your stomach, so what combat power do you expect?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The messy plans are all in the preparation stage, and the most important thing right now is the harvest of spring grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has already shifted his position, and the preparations for the celebration banquet have been left to Baron Redman. Fortunately, there are a group of people from his own clan who came to help him, otherwise he might not be able to handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mainly the poor and the poor in the mountainous areas, in name they held a celebration banquet, but in fact their main job was to supervise the construction of the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main structure is okay, but the key is the interior decoration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sculptors, painters, designers... All kinds of art jobs are hired from the provincial capital with a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't have any artistic cells, but I can't keep up with the thinking rhythm of these people. If these guys are allowed to improvise, the possibility of shock is definitely greater than surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the harvested carts of grain, Hudson didn't feel anything yet, but the others were really taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who spread the rumor that the grain production in the mountains is low?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The yield per mu of the mountainous area is almost the same as that of the plains outside. You must know that this is a wasteland that has just been reclaimed and is in the stage of land cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson had the foresight to plant oil crops in these areas, not the mainstream rye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is that the soil quality is suitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't specialize in soil quality research, so it's hard to tell what kind of crops the soil quality is suitable for planting at a glance. It just so happens that in the continent of Aslant, there is no profession that specializes in soil quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surprise is surprise, envy and jealousy are unnecessary. Everyone's territory is a plain, and almost all the grains planted have high yields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The joy of the harvest did not last long. Hudson was surprised to find that the food shortage in his own territory had not decreased but increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area of ​​newly reclaimed land is indeed quite a lot, adding 110,000 mu of mountainous land and 68,000 mu of paddy fields, another year in which the task was overfulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the rate of increase in land has not caught up with the rate of population growth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no entertainment facilities, and people are created after dark. The serfs who let go of restrictions are more active in the cause of human creation than Hudson expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the statement of one child per year is a bit exaggerated, it is actually not much different. Both men and women of the right age are fully fired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson was too kind to cause trouble. It was stipulated that pregnant women were not allowed to engage in heavy physical labor, and milk and goat milk were distributed to infants and young children, so that everyone would have no worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The natural population growth rate has exceeded 6%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this set of data is not scientific, and the capture statistics period is too short, so the infant mortality rate cannot be accurately included in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Children are easy to feed these days, and adding a group of newborns will not add much to the cost of childcare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really caused the food problem was the orc slaves bought at low prices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soaring number of slaves not only broke the population structure of the territory, but also increased the food shortage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of serfs is only over 28,000, and the orc slaves are about to break through the 60,000 mark. This unhealthy population structure is definitely a threat to the long-term development of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good news is that the total food deficit is increasing, but the food self-sufficiency rate is constantly improving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current speed of land reclamation, it is still very promising to achieve basic food self-sufficiency in two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this news gets out, it will definitely cause a big stir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically achieving self-sufficiency in food means that the bottomless pit of land reclamation in mountainous areas has turned around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is certain to continue to lose money, but the deficit will start to decrease year by year from the current tens of thousands of gold coins per year, and finally turn from negative to positive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to outside estimates, the time of this turning point should be more than ten years later, not in the last two or three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, no matter how optimistic people can imagine, the scene of the earth bear going to the construction site is really too anti-\"bear\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there is only one Earth Bear, and Hudson doesn't dare to squeeze the potential of Bear Stearns. He can only work in a flicker, otherwise this efficiency can be further increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The area of ​​land plowed in spring this year has increased significantly, and your tasks are very heavy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the newly opened paddy fields, we will introduce foreign rice this year, so you should pay more attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beastman slaves are not suitable for fine work, and the spring plowing is still entirely in the charge of the leaders. It is still the old rule, with Baojia as the unit, and tasks are assigned according to the number of laborers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rewards I promised to the people earlier must be fulfilled now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last year, the land reclamation plan for the territory was 100,000 mu, but 110,897 mu of wasteland was actually reclaimed, an overfulfillment of 10,897 mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to one-third of the excess reward settlement, 3632.3 mu of land will be used as public land, which will be distributed by a group of people who have participated in land reclamation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Record it, starting from the next season, the income from this part of the land will be extracted and distributed to each of the people who participated in the land reclamation according to their contribution. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said proudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He really doesn't care about the income of a few thousand acres of land. As long as everyone is willing to work hard, Master Hudson will not be stingy with rewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, these incentives can only be used on serfs. A larger number of slaves can still only rely on forced labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The language barrier made Master Hudson, who is good at drawing big cakes, feel powerless for the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the best ones will eat meat, the worst ones will eat soil, and the worst ones will eat feed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, sir!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone replied in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone is in a good mood. Following a generous lord is obviously more promising than following a stingy lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are clear rewards and punishments for serfs, let alone the management of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For entrepreneurs, reputation is crucial. Especially when facing one's own people, any breach of contract may cause the team to lose heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to lose reputation, but it is extremely difficult to restore it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson continued:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have also prepared your share, and Tom will take it to your residence later.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although many people in Hudson's entrepreneurial team belong to the kind of owners whose origins are unknown and whose loyalty is yet to be tested, the rewards should be given.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These can only be given by Hudson at his own discretion, and no one can help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, there is no Chinese New Year, so there is no way to talk about year-end bonuses, and there is even no clear standard for salary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other way, it is their honor to serve the noble lords these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of treatment are you talking about?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if these people may have been nobles in their ancestors, but in their generation, the titles have long since disappeared, so they are nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ones who can inherit titles are landed nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other honorary nobles are lifelong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The son of an honorable nobleman can also claim to be a son of a nobleman. After all, his father is a real nobleman, and he is nothing to his grandchildren.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the middle generation does not work hard, the younger generation may become civilians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guys who are now following Hudson are all civilians. Claiming to the outside world that the nobles have declined is just a means of self-promotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all come here for wealth and status, and they will definitely not be rich. If other rewards cannot be given, Hudson will not be stingy with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that monetary incentives are still very effective. Nothing has been obtained, and everyone's mood has improved by more than one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there are elements of acting, but life is like a play, who is not an actor?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, last year's plan is completed, what do you think of this year's territory development plan?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Luke asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he was born as a businessman, and he has acquired the ability to observe words and demeanor. At a glance, he saw Hudson's intention to buy people's hearts, and immediately cooperated with it with practical actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The coal that restricts the production of mines has been resolved, and the production capacity of the mines will be doubled this year. The relevant business networks must be spread to neighboring provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is the general trend to replace bronze ware with iron ware, and this is our opportunity. Taking advantage of the opportunity that others are still focusing on weapons orders, go and grab the daily necessities market first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When necessary, the price of exports outside the province can be reduced, and the cost caused by the increase in mid-way freight can also be offset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land reclamation plan, because the adult labor force has increased a bit, the development of mountainous areas has increased to 105,000 mu.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swamp land reclamation plan is tentatively set at 250,000 mu, and it is estimated that 50,000 slaves will be invested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aquaculture…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Coupled with the embellishment of lanterns and festoons, it looks like a kingdom of gods on earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Lord's Mansion, the main building, has been completed, and its first appearance is the beginning of glory, as if telling the birth of a legend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guests who came and went talked and laughed lively, and the lively atmosphere pushed the emotions of the scene to a climax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Oran is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Nicholas is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Simic is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Romwell is here\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of every big person will cause a sensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats who appeared in front of the stage are okay. Even if everyone didn't have a chance to make friends, they still met each other and got acquainted with each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The powerhouses who appeared later were different. Although these cultivators seldom show up, their popularity in the aristocratic circle has never been low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worshiping the strong is human instinct. Facing a group of top strong men, even nobles have to address them as \"Master\" to show their respect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these people will not lack noble titles on their heads. In order to win over these strong men, the title of honorary nobleman was arranged early on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The viscount is just starting out, and he has made several contributions to the kingdom. It is not surprising that he is given the title of earl or marquis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are willing to devote yourself to the kingdom and die, then it goes without saying that it is possible to get the title of Grand Duke. A bit of royal blood, a title of prince, that's all right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of honorary noble is worthless, especially when it comes to wooing the strong, the kingdom has never been stingy with titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because there is no need to pay a salary, when countries in the mainland like to win over the strong, they like to give a series of false titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of a group of powerhouses in the province raised the standard of the banquet suddenly, making all the guests who attended the banquet dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the previous two high-profile banquets, this banquet has completely opened up the grade. The terrifying network resources displayed by Hudson made all the little nobles have to reconsider the issue of standing in line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the nobles in Wright County, who were planning to move closer to the Viscount Sith, instantly woke up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a grand duke whose father is really awesome, but this is the southeastern province. What decides everyone's life and death is still a group of local powerful factions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they don't know how much they support the Mountain Territory, they finally showed their attitude. This means that the forces behind Viscount Sith want to exert political pressure, which cannot be effective here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five giants in the Northland are indeed powerful, but they are only one of them. It is purely a dream to want all the powerful factions in the southeastern province to bow their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If core interests are really involved, even if the five companies add up, everyone will not make concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the northern Xinjiang region is heavily dependent on the southern Xinjiang provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is slightly weaker than the southeast province of the Northland, the large amount of money and food supported every year gives everyone enough voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the reactions of all the guests, it can be seen that the purpose of shocking people's hearts has obviously been achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern Xinjiang nobles who came to make up the numbers are nothing more than their backgrounds determine their positions, and coming to the banquet is just a courtesy congratulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles in the county were really frightened. Many people are secretly glad that they are not in a hurry to accept Viscount Sith's solicitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guy who leaned over first and wanted to speculate is now even more impatient, and wants to cut off with Viscount Sith immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel reality tells them that birth determines position!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to lean over like a wall, you have to ask the local bigwigs first if they will agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County's knockout round of the weak and the strong has only entered the midfield at this moment, and it is far from the time to decide the winner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The position of the county guard just means that the supporters behind them have a stronger voice in the capital. Now here is the statement of the various forces in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    True true false false false false true true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The asymmetry of information allowed a group of minor nobles to directly draw the conclusion based on what they saw with their own eyes: All local forces \"all\" support Hudson's conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone told them, this banquet meant nothing. It's just an ordinary show of mutual favor and icing on the cake, no one will believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of face, how does the Koslow family compare with the Dalton family?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo's celebration banquet had a much lower standard than this. Not to mention a group of strong people, even many middle-level nobles just prepared a congratulatory gift, and they couldn't see anyone at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two sides rushed to get together, and the nobles who were not in the camps of both parties and did not want to offend others, naturally had to be absent at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was originally just a sequela of the banquet time bumping together. Now it has been over-interpreted by many people as: the political stance of various forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of misunderstanding is exactly what Hudson wants to see. He never had too many younger brothers, even younger brothers who had their own ulterior motives, could still shout a few times along with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It works well, but it can also be used to bluff people. Hudson is experienced in playing bluff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many seemingly accidental, but in fact inevitable. This grand banquet was no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many people here, it is because the personal connections are mutual. Today someone came over to support the show, and if someone needs it someday, Hudson will also have to run over to help the platform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocratic network resources are terrifying, and it is essentially a big show of mutual flattery. The ability to continue acting is because the actors are too involved in the play, and they take it seriously when they are acting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you are strong, this kind of thinking is not wrong. Everyone is happy to do the icing on the cake, and can fully enjoy the dividends brought by network resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the power declines, that's another story. Generally speaking, it is definitely better to have many friends than to have no friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the protagonist of the banquet, Hudson is like a hardworking bee, constantly shuttling in the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Important guests should be received with emphasis, and ordinary guests who come to join us should not be neglected either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After talking about unnutritious words over and over again, my throat was about to smoke before I met all the guests face to face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Character settings cannot be lost!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrogance is destined not to belong to the middle and small nobles. If you want to get ahead, you must be courteous and corporal, and show a friendly attitude to everyone as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to Hudson's secret complaints, Baron Redman, who was also wandering around at the banquet, was elated, which made him sigh the strength of his spiritual power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's normal to think about it. After spending most of my life standing still, I finally relied on my son to cross the class. If I can show it off, it will naturally be full of energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wandering around, and returning to the team of strong men, the style of painting became bold and unrestrained again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the banquet was divided into two parts, otherwise the scene of people cooking with monsters would be seen by outsiders, and they would have to applaud while breaking down inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all the bad start of Bear Stearns. The last time he messed around in the Governor's Mansion, he has now received retribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is simply that Hudson has already prepared and prepared the World of Warcraft package in advance. Although the specifications are not as high as the banquet in the Governor's Mansion, it is better to have a large quantity to satisfy your needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Roasted sheep and roasted cows are served whole-headed, and animal milk and honey are served pot by pot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that not all monsters are good at this. Except for the monsters in the bear, other monsters are mainly interested in meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm afraid the mainland is going to be in chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs in the north began to be restless again. There are many signs that they are preparing their horses and fighting hard, and the battle to invade the south is imminent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is not sure is where they will focus their attack. Let's hope it's not the Alpha Kingdom, or we'll be in trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's even more damning is that at this moment of crisis, the Holy See is still restless. Not long ago, it ended its conflict with us, and recently it has confronted the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shamelessly claiming that their king is illegal, do you really think they are still ruling the mainland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Say what, what is it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just wait, as the most powerful country on the mainland, the Kingdom of Franks will not save them face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one day I wake up and a bunch of new Dawn Holy See suddenly appear, I will not be surprised at all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on which country is willing to take the lead. Anyway, our Alpha Kingdom will most likely follow suit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Longwell said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an earth knight, he has personally trained on the orc battlefield. It's just that it was just a medium-scale southward plunder, and only two of the five orc royal courts came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, the Alpha Kingdom suffered heavy losses. It took 200,000 troops and 500,000 civilian casualties before the orcs were driven out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Longwell's view, rather than driving the orcs out, it is better to rely on the defense line of the fortress, dragging down the logistics of the orc empire and being forced to withdraw.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether to be cowardly or not. No one really wants to face such a difficult guy like the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the orc invasion to the south was enough trouble. But the Holy See is still not at ease now, and keeps doing things on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time they supported the Skull and Bones to cause chaos, they accidentally exposed the existence of the \"Blood Moon Horn\", and the Alpha Kingdom found them on their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time with the replacement of the Franconian throne, the selected supporters had a little accident, and they accidentally got caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the Holy See's investment must have failed, and it lost everything. If it weren't for this, the pope wouldn't have declared the new king illegitimate in anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this doesn't make any sense. The nobles vote directly with their feet, and the support of the Holy See's opposition is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Illegal, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the Holy See announced this decision, they were still waiting to see the situation, and the human nations that did not immediately recognize the new king of the Frankish Kingdom expressed their positions—recognizing its legitimacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the absence of the pope to participate in the coronation ceremony, it is also very simple, just downgrade and hold it. If there is no pope to preside over it, just pick a bishop at random to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this is nothing new. Like the Alpha Kingdom, the king appoints an archbishop, and the archbishop presides over the coronation ceremony of the king's succession.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the Frankish Kingdom is the most powerful country in the human race, its cards are bigger. Every time there is a change of throne, the Pope personally presides over it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the two sides have completely fallen out, then play on your own. Anyway, when it comes to military strength, the Frankish Kingdom is almost the same as the Holy See, so I don't hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not only these, it is said that the South Coast Kingdom has recently clashed with the Ash Dwarves, and the Hesse Kingdom has also had conflicts with the Mountain Dwarves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom of Dante in the east seems to be in conflict with the kingdom of elves because of the issue of slavery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar skirmishes are numerous. It feels like overnight, the human race has become the enemy of the whole world. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Antar Magister said with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Antal, you are making too much fuss. Since becoming the overlord of the mainland, when has my human race not been the enemy of the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of which race becomes the overlord of the continent, they will all enjoy this kind of treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they were peace-loving elves, when they ruled the mainland hundreds of thousands of years ago, they were also enemies of the world?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the overlord of the mainland, how can he be afraid of these conspiracies and tricks. If you want to come, come, all of them are in trouble, and it happens to be resolved at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the nations of the human race do not fight among themselves, even if they are added together, it is not enough for us to fight. What's there to be afraid of?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we withstand the invasion of the orcs, other battlefields have nothing to do with us. Even if it wanted to control it, the Alpha Kingdom didn't have the strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today is different from the past. With the power of the Three Kingdoms, we may not be able to severely damage the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can hurt the vitality of the orcs, we can not only regain the lost ground, but also push the front line northward by thousands of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come here three or five times over and over again, you can also turn the orc empire into history, and completely solve this great enemy that threatens the survival of our human race! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magister Claude said domineeringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hawks among magicians are rare to see. Most magicians are known for their rationality, and only a very small number of other magicians are full of passion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Claude magister in front of him is undoubtedly an alternative among the alternatives. As far as Hudson knew, this man not only clamored for war, but also studied various war weapons by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that these weapons of war are inseparable from magic. No one knows the specific results, but this spirit is definitely worth admiring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the human magicians come up with more big killers, maybe the northern battlefield will not always be passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the heated discussion among the powerful, Hudson could only be a silent audience. The lack of sources of information made him lose his right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the entire continent, even the Koslow family received the news of the changes that occurred within the Alpha Kingdom, and it was a step slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of receiving messages is slow, and the speed of delivering messages is even slower. Unless it may involve their own interests, everyone did not pass this idea to each other at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by poverty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the branches take the initiative to collect information and exchange information in a timely manner, at least thousands of gold coins will be added to the annual cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of branches, large and small, seem to be amortized, but it seems that there are not many. But the problem is that there are many branches in the middle, which are really poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some even failed to keep their aristocratic family status, and became civilians directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Hudson's initiative to invite and become a branch of civilians, he would never have participated in this event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe something to do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it is replaced by civilians who want to counterattack, they will have to bear even more criticism and pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He did everything he could, and Hudson didn't dare to hope that everyone would like him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are on the same path, they will be drawn over; the neutral camp, plant another seed while stabilizing; the hostile camp, shake the opponent's determination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the goal has been achieved. The younger brothers who originally supported him became more determined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The swaying grasshoppers were preparing to stand in line to support Viscount Sith, and now the balance has tilted again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the nobles of the North who are clearly hostile, their confidence in Sith is not as strong as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong dragon does not overwhelm the local snake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This principle, they have personally experienced it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impact on the outside world is second, and the Koslow family is the most affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's time to bet again. Now Hudson is no longer a potential stock, but a high-growth stock that has completed its transformation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if you have a branch of the foundation. You can't move the fief, so you have to think carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the declining branch of the industry, there is nothing to hesitate. They have all been reduced to the point of dawdling with civilians, so there is nothing to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to hang out with your own family than to wander and struggle outside. At the very least, Hudson is willing to pay for the basic training resources of the younger generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow and continue, maybe you won't get the fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the most basic decency of the nobility can be maintained. Wearing the same family badge, they can calmly call themselves the children of nobility when they go out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many collateral descendants of the Koslow family are there?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a muddled account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong fertility has created large and small branches, and it is not even clear how many branches there are, let alone how many tribes there are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this will not trouble Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslant, which pays attention to the inheritance of blood, there are many ways to identify blood, and it is impossible to get away with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone who is willing to come will be accepted, and then a blood test will be done. It just so happens that Hudson has this magic in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talents are always better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how miserable the nobles are, the upper limit of their cultivation potential is still much higher than that of ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family has fallen, but there is still a lot of knowledge, which has been passed down through word of mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have close blood relatives who are well-connected, you can also foster your children in the homes of noble relatives, and get educational resources together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These children all have a certain foundation, as long as they are cultivated a little, they will be good management talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the current mountainous territory, basic talents are enough. Higher-level talents can be screened out slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, these younger generations are entrusted to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are not required to train them all to become talents, at least you cannot let them live worse than they are now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were many family elders present, because of their status, only Baron Redman was qualified to say this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be for Hudson, but also for a group of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The implication is very clear, there must be care, but there are too many children in the family, it is impossible to take care of everyone, limited resources can only be tilted to the truly capable juniors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was a bit cruel to the descendants of the family, but who made the Koslow family too prosperous?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were hundreds of teenagers present alone, and I don't know how many there are if they didn't come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All focus on training, even the great nobles can't do it, let alone Hudson, a new Viscount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't show a certain potential, but no one wants to spend resources on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, father!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have rich experience in leading soldiers, and I won't let my pearls get dusted!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unique geographical location of the Alpha Kingdom determines that the nobles of the kingdom are full of martial spirit. Quite a bit of everything is low-grade, only the \"strong\" is high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is undoubtedly a place to hone the strong. It just so happened that the Mountain Territory was also famous for its \"strong soldiers\" in the southeastern provinces. Everyone knew that Hudson was not only good at fighting by himself, but also good at training soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other places, the army is undoubtedly the easiest to stand out. Even if it's just a small officer, it's still a potential stock, with a higher status than ordinary stewards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all from their own family. After making contributions, it is not too much to get a life essence, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one has passed the age at which knights can practice best, as long as one can become a knight, it will be a renaissance for many fallen branches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Hudson directly said that these people should be used as ordinary management talents, I am afraid that all the clansmen present would faint with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are small problems, and the army also has a elimination rate. If one's talent is insufficient and one is eliminated during training, no one can say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, being in the army can go to the battlefield at any time. It is irresponsible to everyone to send unqualified children to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being eliminated, he will train in the direction of basic management talents, that is, his master Hudson cares about his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the joy of the guests and the host, the Koslow family completed the first reunion in a century. There are three main results:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    1. Make a copy of all the knowledge in each vein and store it in the mountain area to enrich the accumulation of family heritage. Children of all families can come and learn for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second, people from all sectors contribute their efforts to jointly promote the development of mountainous areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    3. Strengthen exchanges and cooperation, especially intelligence and military linkages, to prepare for the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more specific implementation details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, it is to strengthen the family's strength as much as possible to cope with the next major changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of branches with fiefdoms, even assigned the task of expanding the army according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, once this military expansion plan is completed, the total force that the entire Koslow family can mobilize will exceed 12,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On paper, this military strength ranks among the top five among the middle-level nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson is not so optimistic. The plan is always just a plan, and the specifics still depend on the implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family can't afford to support so many standing troops, so this huge army is still mostly serf soldiers in essence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the busy farming season, people must go to the fields to work. Only in the slack season will the lord organize regular training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specifically, whether to practice once a day, or once every three days, or once every ten days and half a month, depends on your specific execution ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there are some lazy guys whose training intensity can't keep up with the reserves in the mountain territory. At least Master Hudson trained the reserve team every ten days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is certain is that a trained army is stronger than an untrained army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the chance of seeing blood is limited to hunting with the lord, it is more effective than a serf who has just put down his hoe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all forced out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who keeps everyone obsessed with recovering the ancestral land, and insists on Hudson coming up with a feasible plan?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, the most feasible way is to strengthen its own military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Koslow family has tens of thousands of elites on hand after the next orc invasion, they can easily regain their ancestral land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this is an almost impossible task. There are no tens of thousands of troops now, let alone after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called plan to recover the ancestral land is actually a moon in the water, a flower in the mirror.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But dreams are always necessary. If there is no dream, how can Hudson make cakes for everyone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a reason for being tall, why should the various branches send their children to support the development of the mountain territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to family glory, there are many things that have no choice at all. Even though everyone is equally skeptical about Hudson's plan, it is still the most feasible in theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally returning to the ranks of middle-class nobles, if the Koslow family does not take some practical actions to recover their ancestral land, how can they have the nerve to hang out in the noble circle?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Can't do it and don't do it, those are two concepts. The former is a question of ability, while the latter is a question of attitude.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really thought that everyone was doing well in the south, and you still want to jump into the tiankeng in the north?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps the older generation, who are deeply influenced by the glory of the family, indeed regard it as a lifelong wish to regain their ancestral land; but most of the younger generation, including Hudson, have no love for the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not wanting to and not doing it are two different concepts. Even Caesar III still shouted slogans every day, wanting to regain the kingdom's homeland?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king cannot break away from the rules of the game, let alone the small Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that her status as a concubine is also limited. If it weren't for the contribution of offering the water of life, it is still unknown whether she is still here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since becoming the Crown Prince, Alex has had more fun. Now this is fairly normal, it is only exaggerated when holding a banquet, and directly bring the concubine to play and exchange with the guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a nightmare for all the concubines in the mansion. As long as they are required to participate, it means that their good days are over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happens next depends entirely on Crown Prince Alex's mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to this desperate way of tossing, the probability of Crown Prince Alex walking ahead of Emperor Beamon is almost ninety-nine percent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a large initial investment, I don't know if the Holy See can bear the sunk cost. Anyway, Xiandel, who came undercover, can't afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persuasion is meaningless, and the high probability of the ending of the opening is that I will lie under that guy and have fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's obviously disgusting, but she has to pretend to enjoy it, Xiandale really can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, she would like to kill the guy in front of her immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that people in the Holy See can't help themselves, they can't let their tempers go, and they must prioritize tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Control Alex and influence the decision-making of the Orc Empire?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chandal very much doubts whether the high level of the Holy See who made this decision has lost his mind. With the performance of this guy in front of him, even if he succeeds to the Beamon throne, his fate will be ostracized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe a coup d'état occurred after the first foot was ascended to the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The concept of respecting the strong has long penetrated into every corner of the orc empire. Violence is written in their bones, they cannot accept a waste emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Go down, I'm going to rest!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the habit of Crown Prince Alex. No matter how happy he is, he will not leave a group of concubines when he sleeps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After watching everyone leave, Crown Prince Alex, who was originally full of lust, seemed to have changed suddenly, and his whole person became gloomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After quickly putting on the clothes, a secret door suddenly opened, and a swaying shadow appeared in the hall full of desire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, please take care of yourself, if this goes on...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Shadow could finish speaking, Alex interrupted with a wave:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Yinmei.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to repeat such meaningless words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I know how my body is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This romantic drama has been going on for decades, how can it stop at the last moment. What's more, it's not like I can stop now if I want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old guy didn't have a good life for a few years. If he wanted to maintain the current father's kindness and filial piety, this scene must continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secrets cannot be hidden in this mansion, and it is full of eyeliners from various forces. In order to monitor my every move, they sent over the elites who spent a lot of money to cultivate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the kindness is hard to turn down, why should I refuse their kindness?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How are your preparations going?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Estimating that old guy's patience, I am afraid that he is about to run out. The pitiful father-son relationship, after so many years of consumption, who knows how much is left? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Alex couldn't help but burst into tears. For so many years, he seemed to be singing and dancing every day, and indulged in joy, but in fact he couldn't tell the pain in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, he would rather not know that secret, and spend his life in a daze like the previous brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there was no other way. An accidental break-in found that the coffin of his deceased brother was empty, which aroused his curiosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this investigation, he discovered the shocking truth, which directly changed his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original hard-working Alex no longer exists, replaced by Alex who is greedy for money, lust, and indulges in fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that I could indulge myself and spend my life mediocrely despite the infamy from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, the unwillingness deep in his heart still failed to make him lie down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to gain a chance of life, and to ask for an explanation from the person closest to him before, Alex decided to rebel against the established fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After years of planning, it is finally time to close the net, but Alex is still suffering in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is both the fear of imminent events and the inseparable family affection. Apart from that unspeakable matter, Emperor Bimeng was really impeccable towards their brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Especially for a sad king like him who is a neighbor of orcs, the pressure he endures every day is far more than that of his peers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the first twelve kings of the Alpha Kingdom, none of them lived long, which is enough to explain everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relatively speaking, Caesar III has already lived a long life. Thanks to the old age of Emperor Bimon, in his more than 30 years of kingship, the orc empire has not been able to invade the south with all its strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there is still a tradition in the Alpha Kingdom. A king who has not experienced the full-scale invasion of orcs, his life is incomplete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous twelve generations of emperors all fought **** battles with the Orc Empire. Although Caesar III also led troops to fight against the orc empire, but the last time he invaded was only the second of the five orc royal families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom tried its best, but the Orc Empire was just playing. It is said that it is going south to plunder, but it is actually consuming the surplus population in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply calculating the exchange ratio between the two sides, the Alpha Kingdom even achieved a good result of one to two, which is a big victory over the enemy in terms of statistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the orcs who were wiped out are mostly piggies, ratmen, goblins, kobolds... and other low-level races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a race with a little combat power appears on the battlefield, the battle loss ratio of the two sides will be reversed instantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The good-looking data is mainly to whitewash the record and inspire people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in northern Xinjiang is becoming increasingly tense. As the king, Caesar III is also under great pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he intends to clean up those restless guys in the north, the prerequisite is that the safety of northern Xinjiang must be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the overall situation, the old grievances in the past are not important at all. If the situation really collapses, no one on the same boat will be able to please anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the threat of orcs was troublesome enough, but the situation on the mainland was still unstable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only are there constant disputes between the human race and the alien race, but even the human race is full of gunpowder. If the big bosses from all sides hadn't sensed the breath of conspiracy and forcibly suppressed the conflict from escalating, it would have been a mess of eight treasure porridge by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can tell how long this strong suppression will last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, there are still conflicts of interest that already existed, and now they have been taken from under the table to the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no major conflict of conflicting interests between the parties. No matter how much the black hands behind the scenes can provoke, it is impossible to provoke so many disputes so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One back to life and two back to acquaintance, based on past experience and lessons, Caesar III naturally came to the conclusion that the orcs were about to invade the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you sent them all that special gift?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was these guys who caused the Alpha Kingdom to suffer from the plague of locusts last year, and now they have the opportunity to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the resulting consequences, Caesar III was already mentally prepared. Since war is unavoidable, then simply take the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What worries him is the situation on the mainland. The chaotic continent has restrained the energy of many human nations, and the support of the countries on the continent for the Alpha Kingdom is likely to be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It has been delivered secretly. For safety reasons, we have also erased the memory of the insect king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone finds out, there is no evidence that we did it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that many things don't need evidence. The locust plague was discovered in the Kingdom last year, and we may still be suspected. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland solemnly reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following a monarch who is too capable is not necessarily a good thing. He was very clear about Caesar III's ambitions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When I was young, it was my duty to defeat the orc empire and regain the lost land every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting older, people become more mature, and rationality gradually gains the upper hand, so they change their attitudes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But creatures like emperors can never just look at the surface. His intuition told the Grand Duke of Newfoundland that his king's hostility towards the orc empire had surged again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that they want to take advantage of the internal changes in the orc empire to take advantage of the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Alex became the crown prince, the Beamon royal court has not been peaceful. The voices of the opposition to this lustful crown prince are getting louder and louder, and it is all suppressed by the old Bimon Emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long this suppression can last, no one can tell. Perhaps only one fuse is needed to trigger a coup.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the five imperial courts of the Orc Empire, if there is a problem with the Bimon Imperial Court, it is undoubtedly the best opportunity to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pulling the other two countries together to make trouble, coupled with the support of the nations of the human race, theoretically speaking, the odds of winning are not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Caesar III was old. If I miss this opportunity, I am afraid that it will be difficult to meet a better opportunity in my lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is inevitable to be suspected. It's just that the false and the real are mixed together, and it will be difficult for the enemy to determine who succeeded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the enemies of those two families are all over the mainland. It is reasonable for someone to pretend to be us and deliberately stir up disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those old guys are the most suspicious, let them guess slowly! Whether they find out or not, the end result is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That idiot Pius VII has offended the Frankish Kingdom to death. The matter is not so easy to end, and there will inevitably be disputes in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the orc empire in the north, isn't it already confirmed that they are preparing to invade the south? Anyway, war is inevitable, and it doesn't hurt to add a reason for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order, and the new round of nobility canonization ceremony will be held ahead of the end of the year! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said with confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidence comes from strength. Compared with the previous war, the overall national strength of the Alpha Kingdom has increased too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, all major forces in the country have been secretly expanding their military. In particular, the growing military strength of the nobles in southern Xinjiang is narrowing the gap with the nobles in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the short term, this seems to be a good thing, and it is more conducive to the internal balance of the kingdom. But Caesar III was not short-sighted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the northern nobles who were under the orc soldiers, the southern nobles who were not threatened by foreign enemies would be the real trouble once they became bigger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mergers within the nobility have never stopped. It seems that the number of noble lords in the kingdom is not expected to change much, but the number of nobles holding multiple positions is increasing every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those big aristocrats, every three to five years will do a wave of things, and annex one or two territories by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The movement range is not large, each time it is only one or two knight collars, and winning a baronet collar is considered a big move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all a little action, obviously playing with borrowing a knife to kill someone, but hiding himself tightly. Every merger is planned years or even decades in advance before taking action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The whitewashing is so good that the small and medium nobles below don't feel much. If it wasn't for looking at the time period, Caesar III would have almost ignored the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past hundred years, the territorial area of ​​the big families in the country has increased by more than one tenth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation does not change, the balance will inevitably be broken. The group of big-tailed guys in the north alone is worrying enough, and Caesar III doesn't want to see a few more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the increasingly acute internal conflicts are also one of the reasons why the Alpha Kingdom must start a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things also happened in the Orc Empire. It's just that compared to the \"rules\" of the internal struggles of the Alpha Kingdom, the Orc Empire is much more brutal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't agree on an agreement, you will fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The struggle among the internal tribes is no less cruel than foreign wars. Sometimes battles are lost and genocide can even ensue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have reasons to start a war. It can be said that the war is on the way, and it depends on when the last layer of window paper is pierced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These problems, Caesar III can see. All the big forces in the country can also be analyzed. As long as those in power are not stupid, they know that war will inevitably break out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding the nobility canonization ceremony in advance is undoubtedly a clear political signal. Almost every time the kingdom enshrines nobles in advance, a war will break out in the following year or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you meet more by chance, it becomes inevitable. So much so that the canonization of nobles in advance has become a weather vane to inform everyone to prepare for the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Mountain Territory, Hudson, who had just been fully staffed, was confused by the order from the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Premature canonization\", in theory, must be a good thing for the nobles themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after accepting the king's personal canonization, can the title of nobility be considered legal in the true sense, and can have a seat in the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike now, although he has the title of nobility, he is actually a \"quasi-noble\" status. In the event of an accident, there is a possibility of deprivation of identity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he didn't know the history of the Alpha Kingdom, Hudson might be as happy as a bunch of little nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too bad he knows too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the union, he heard the news from a group of \"friends\", and his reason told him that big trouble was coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory, which is in the development stage, is not yet ready for war, especially the all-out war against the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, every time in a war of this level, the big nobles will decline, and the small and medium nobles will reshuffle even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people were shrouded in horse leather and died in battle;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, this is an era of major reshuffle. Full of all hope on the battlefield, it is also accompanied by endless despair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time a war breaks out, the Alpha Kingdom will suffer heavy losses. Countless powerful families will fall in the war, and new forces will rise to replace them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it should be regarded as a further step forward of the established forces. To be able to replace a big force, one's own background accumulation is destined not to be low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by the social background. In addition to the kingdom's standing army, the main force participating in the war is the private army of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take your own troops to the battlefield and want to make great achievements in battle. How can you do it without any strength?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a class transition, no one has jumped from a commoner to a great aristocrat. Even if the king is willing to canonize it, the actual situation has to be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the battlefield, personal abilities are limited after all. The main force of the battle is still the army, even if it is the top powerhouse in the mainland, it is inconspicuous in the vast crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at Beijiang, Hudson sighed helplessly. I originally thought that the mountainous territory had developed well, and as long as I devoted myself to farming for a few decades, I would be able to create a great foundation of my own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan has not changed quickly, and the mountainous territory has not yet been developed, but the pace of war is approaching one step ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire continent, the mountain collar is still too weak. Even compared with the mid-level nobles in the kingdom, the mountain leaders are all behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have only a dozen knights and thousands of miscellaneous soldiers are not counted as those who are at the bottom of the middle nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When encountering such a thing, some powerful little nobles can slap the table with them and stare. In addition to the good name, the actual right to speak is almost zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real middle-class nobles not only own a large number of fiefdoms, but also have their own elite teachers. The best among them have the ability to fight against the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the mountainous territory has not yet developed to its full extent. Although with the addition of other branches, the strength of the Koslow family is not weak on paper, but what is false is ultimately false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you brag about it in normal times, but if you take it seriously, you'll be a fool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, Hudson immediately strengthened the training of the family's children. Regardless of whether they are related households or not, at this time, he would never recognize them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the short term, it is unrealistic to improve the overall strength of the territory. The only thing that can be done is to increase military strength first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for other shortcomings, put them on hold first, and then find ways to make up for them after the situation stabilizes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, inform Master Riha to increase the production capacity of the mine, especially the production capacity of weapons and equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, the weapons produced in the territory should not only pay attention to the quantity, but also improve the quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to do it specifically, let them find out by themselves. In short, the military production capacity of the mine must be doubled within half a year. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without a doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For arms dealers, any major war is an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson didn't want to make this kind of war fortune, but the opportunities were all presented to him, and it was really unreasonable to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking from another angle, increasing military production capacity is also contributing to the fight against orcs and the great cause of protecting mankind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the human race, justice is 100%. As for the orcs, Hudson, who has a straight ass, doesn't think about the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, sir!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't know what happened, but what my master ordered, I just do it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were so many knight attendants who came out together at the beginning, the most important thing for him to be able to follow Hudson all the time was to have winks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is a lack of ability to go out and take charge of one's own work, the execution ability has never been compromised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All orders to Hudson have only one thought—execution. As for why it should be executed, that is not his concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, but what happened?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the person in charge of arms sales, Nick is very aware that the military production capacity of the Mountain Territory has long been in a state of excess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the easing of the situation, the junk weapons in the mountain territories have become increasingly difficult to sell. Many craftsmen who make weapons have to work part-time to make agricultural tools and other daily necessities for production and daily life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the military production capacity is suddenly doubled. If there is no change, he will not be able to sell the extra weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs in the north are restless. Maybe one day they will come. I just plan ahead and prepare first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to keep this kind of news secret. Even if the group of people under his command have spies placed by other forces, it cannot be from the side of the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, he was a humble little nobleman. At most, it is well-known in the southeast province, and the name cannot be spread to the orc empire at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other forces may have various purposes, but when it comes to fighting the orc invasion, everyone is still on the same front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to do something, it is at the end of the war and the human race has won a big victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long time to come, all major forces will have to join forces to fight against the orc invasion.

Even if he succeeded in getting the position of sheriff, he still couldn't let go of his worries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly received an edict to confer a title in advance, Sith's mood became even heavier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the second generation want to live a comfortable life, relying on fighting father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the war broke out in northern Xinjiang, the Felix family would be overwhelmed. Would Grand Duke Kavadia still care about his illegitimate son?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to even fight, as long as the situation in the north is tense enough, we can't care about this side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of the Grand Duke's father, his life as an outsider will be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that seizing the position of sheriff would be able to gather a group of fools and establish rule over Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ideal is full, but the reality is very skinny.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of bigwigs among the local aristocrats just went to the mountains to show their faces, and the grasshoppers distanced themselves from him one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not enough support from younger brothers, just a group of noble children from the north, obviously not enough in the troubled times that follow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, don't worry too much. So many years have passed, and this time the family will definitely be able to carry it through...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Responding to Butler Faerun's persuasion, Sith shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is no time to worry about the family, how can an illegitimate child get the family solidarity, he is worried about himself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Conferring the title in advance also means fulfilling obligations to the kingdom in advance. If a war starts in northern Xinjiang, as a noble lord, he also needs to lead his troops to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, nobles' private armies go to the battlefield in a mixed region, and the county guard often commands the entire county's army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a full-scale war broke out, a large county like Wright County would form an army of ten thousand people in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like a large number, but in fact, in a war of this scale, it is impossible to rely on the outside world for logistical supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if you fight on your own land, there is no place to grab it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to guarantee the logistics supply, the number of auxiliary troops is often more than that of the main combat troops, usually accounting for 50% to 60%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the battle line is too long, the auxiliary army may account for 70% to 80%. If fighting along the coast or along the river, it is possible for the auxiliary troops to be reduced to 20 to 30%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as the leader of an army, even on the battlefield in northern Xinjiang, Sith can be counted as middle and upper-level officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But that is only in theory, the premise of being able to form an army is that the minor nobles below are willing to form a team with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the survival rate on the battlefield, the Kingdom encourages grouping together. The kind of nobles who are full of contradictions and know that they will stab each other at a glance will never appear on the same battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a common phenomenon in the kingdom to form legions based on family relatives and neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the northern front, the Alpha Kingdom has always been at a disadvantage. In order to survive, everyone must be as united as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current situation in Wright County, Sith doesn't think Hudson will team up with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the participation of local nobles, it is a miracle that the children of northern Xinjiang nobles who have been severely injured can gather 3,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It sounds like this number is quite a lot. If there are 3,000 elites, it will not be bad on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the nobles of the Northland suffered heavy losses not long ago, and the elite soldiers brought over were exiled to the front line in advance because they participated in the robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to gather an army, there are only two choices left for him: either return to the northern Xinjiang army with the team; or mix with the army of a small local county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can go back, Sith will not have to worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The feudal nobles are responsible for guarding the land. If you want to make a strategic move, go ahead and dream!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the army of the nobles of the northern border fiefs, it's okay when you win a battle. If you lose a battle, others can't run away. Can you let him leave with the team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mixed with other small county troops, it is also not a good life. At the very least, it is impossible for him to take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Sith has rich combat experience, it is useless. Governor Pierce will not let the nobles of the Northland get ahead under his own hands. This is a matter of principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that these can be tolerated. The key is that the combat effectiveness of this kind of troops with inconsistent command is often very impressive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not careful, the whole army will be defeated. If you are lucky, you can save a life. If you are not lucky, you will be killed on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom has a strict system. Unless the order is executed and the military exploits are suffered heavy losses in the process, you can go back to reorganize the army first, and then come back after a rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, even if the army is wiped out, don't even think about leaving the battlefield to recuperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Paddle on the battlefield does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have any soldiers in your hands, then organize them into other armies to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every knight is the main force on the battlefield, and it is difficult to leave easily before the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were not these restrictions, the casualty rate of nobles would not have remained high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now let's see how high the status of these northern nobles is in their own family. Can you get family investment again in the case of previous failures?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the time is too close. If it takes three to five years and everyone recovers, he doesn't have to worry so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, he envied Hudson. Although he came from a small noble family, he climbed fast!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly became the pillar of the family, once the war broke out, each branch would come over and form a group by itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My own family alone can gather an army, plus the younger brothers who follow the trend, the grasshoppers who follow the trend, and some relatives and friends who are willing to come and form a group, maybe two armies can be gathered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the combat effectiveness of this patchwork of troops is worrying, as reinforcements to support the front line, most of the time they perform the task of defending the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher-ups of the kingdom are not stupid. It is definitely out of their minds to use a team assembled by small and medium-sized nobles to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the densely packed castles and fortresses in the Northland, we can see that the Alpha Kingdom is mainly defensive in the face of the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In some important fortresses, there are usually enough water and food stored for the defenders to consume for three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really challenged the orc army was the kingdom's standing army and the elite of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “With great power comes great responsibility.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not kidding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the Alpha Kingdom could unite and unite to the outside world every time it came to a critical moment, it would have been wiped out ten times by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Collar, Baron Kettley, who received the message, looked even more gloomy and terrifying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he has encountered a curse, but since he went south, everything went wrong for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several times of planning, they all ended in failure. Although losses were avoided by virtue of super emergency response capabilities, failure was ultimately failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, among the territories in the two counties, the development of Maple Leaf Territory is not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't stand it and I'm afraid of comparison in everything. Compared with the mountain collar next door, the development of Maple Leaf collar is simply impossible to see.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is in a peaceful age, it is not a problem to develop slowly. Kettley has figured it out a long time ago, and now he is no longer compared with his good neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the Lord of Dawn is not blessed, and the increasingly tense situation in the North has shattered Baron Kettley's fantasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, do you think I should accept Sith's solicitation now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no eternal enemy among the nobles. With the settlement of the position of sheriff, Kettler is no longer a competitor of the Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after the strength of the opposition faction was hit hard, now the two sides are not at the same level at all, and they don't even have the qualifications to become competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being not a competitor, Baron Kettley has the value of being wooed. The elite soldier in your hand is the best bargaining chip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it can only be placed outside and cannot be returned to the territory for a short period of time, once a war breaks out, all this will no longer be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, this question can only be judged by yourself. In terms of strategic vision, no one in the younger generation of the family can match you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Asking this sentence should be based on the current situation, and you are not optimistic about the development prospects of Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that our identities are too embarrassing. If we return to the family, we will go back to the old way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang is not a place to wait for a long time, which is left by the divination of the ancestors in the past. No accident for so many years does not mean that there will be no accidents in the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the younger generation are now mostly arranged outside. Obviously, the family is also aware of the danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My identity is not enough, and the information I know is limited. Perhaps there is a greater danger, which is inconvenient to disclose. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman thought for a while and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the nobles in southern Xinjiang were soft persimmons, and they could quickly gain a foothold when they went south. However, their luck was really bad, as soon as they came here, they encountered strong neighbors, forcing them to keep their own place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, you misunderstood. I finally jumped out of the vortex of the Northland, how could I send myself back again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that the Sith are not having a good time now, and the biggest force in Wright County is next door to us. How strong the mountain collar is, you can feel it if you think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accumulation of the Koslow family can support a middle-class nobleman, and Hudson's personal ability is even more unmatched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that the Sith will be squeezed out if the battle in northern Xinjiang comes together. After all, it is much easier to annex ready-made cultivated land than to open up wasteland. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The county guard not only enjoys bonuses, but also bears corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside other things, whether the tax can be collected is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are people in the king, it is beyond reach. The Governor's Palace will only put pressure on Sith, and it is impossible to personally send someone to help him collect taxes from the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can't be done, the Governor's Mansion will hand over the errand to someone who can handle it. Kettler had no doubt that Hudson could persuade the provincial high-level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of taxation power is equivalent to the loss of fiscal power. The Kingdom does not pay salaries to county officials, and all income depends on sharing profits from taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only financial power, the outbreak of war requires the formation of an army, and if the local nobles play by themselves, most of the military power Sith will lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sheriff who lost both financial power and military power is a rubber stamp. Not only can't take care of the younger brothers, but they may also be targeted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You want to defect to the past?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for Baron Kettley to answer, he added another sentence:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The mountain viscount, what price did you offer?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing in line has never been a problem for nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they were born in the Northland, it was only a loose alliance. It can be born because of interests, and it can also be dispersed because of interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is not a vassal of the Sith, and has never surrendered before, so naturally he cannot be said to be betrayed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the interests are suitable to switch camps, Holman does not think there is a problem. Just like the grass on the wall among the local nobles deliberately moved closer to Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If he bids, I won't worry about it. From the beginning to the end, that person only expressed goodwill in secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should be the pressure from the local aristocratic camp, which made that person not make up his mind. Perhaps after the outbreak of the war, the environment will be more relaxed for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only me, most of the northern nobles have received hints. Now there is no Sith action, I don't know if he really doesn't know, or he is pretending to be confused. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most tangled part is here, just showing kindness is not talking about treatment. This kind of wooing is the most annoying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Promise, I am afraid that the treatment will not keep up, and I will become cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reject it, and worry that other nobles of the same camp will defect, and finally become the unlucky ones who are excluded together with Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bayda City\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stepping into this familiar place again, Hudson's identity is quite different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imperial edict of the royal capital also caused an uproar among the high-level officials in the province. In response to the following changes, Earl Pierce initiated this high-level meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a representative of Wright County, Hudson was also honored to be invited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much friction there is at home, once they appear on the battlefield in northern Xinjiang, everyone is still the best ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Team up with people who are familiar with each other, at least you can understand a little bit, and you can roughly judge the lower limit of the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats like Hudson who have a good reputation and never betray their teammates have always been the most popular with their teammates. It can be seen from the smiles in the eyes of everyone that he is very welcome to join.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scanning the participants, Hudson found that, except for himself representing Wright County, who replaced the Viscount of Sith, the rest were all county sheriffs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the Viscount Cayo, seven of the 15 counties in the southeastern province belong to the Dalton family. The name of the first family in the province is completely well deserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the information collected by the Governor's Office. You can circulate it to each other, but it is forbidden to disclose any information in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This confidentiality contract was written by a master alchemist. Before the official opening of the meeting, please sign the agreement first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trust does not exist. Compared with everyone's integrity, Governor Pierce obviously believes in the power of magical contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps this is also the reason why everyone can cooperate closely on the battlefield. There is a magic contract, and breaking the agreement will cost a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bigger the person is, the more he cherishes his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is absolutely necessary, very few people are willing to lose their own lives for breach of contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that the contract was limited to keeping the content of the conversation permanently secret, and there were no other pitfalls, Hudson also signed his name.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, he felt a kind of **** on himself. It's just that this feeling is fleeting, obviously this is the power of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not violate the agreement, so naturally this mysterious power would not be triggered. What if the agreement is violated, Hudson has not lived enough, and he is not ready to die for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all these treasures were taken out, Hudson became more and more interested in the next conversation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just after reading the materials circulated, Hudson was not calm at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The various forces in a mess seemed to have made an appointment, and they jumped out together to make troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom can be peaceful because of the big boss of the Orc Empire, who is about to kill him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the major forces of the human race, goalkeepers are still necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the Holy See who wants to make trouble, it just wants to stir up disputes and benefit from it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one is foolish enough to really want the Alpha Kingdom to end immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this powerful goalkeeper, the orcs would drive straight in and kill them, which would threaten the dominance of the Terran Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For alien races, human race is not a good thing, but being unable to stand up to orcs is even more abhorrent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The many races in the Orc Empire did not come together naturally, but the result of the five rogue races forming an alliance and conquering them everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human beings were able to seize the overlordship of the continent, to a large extent, thanks to the killing of the orcs back then, which severely injured the vitality of all the alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two dogs fight, play off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race is the one who picks up the cheap ones. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the boss of the orcs, they unite with other races to give them a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Changed the human race to be the masters, and the essence has not changed. The only difference is that human beings have stronger political methods and have learned to cover up and frame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they are not as cruel as the orcs. Most of the time they like to attack secretly, and they like to whitewash the peace on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how you can hide it, there will be a day when you can't help it. Even if you didn't realize it at the time when you suffered a loss, you will slowly recollect it later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no accident, and soon it was the turn of the human race to become the public enemy of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is all for the better survival of the race, not to mention justice and evil. Whichever side the **** sits on is the side of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the human race, Hudson naturally would not complain about the alien race. There is destined to be only one overlord of the mainland, and there will be no power without contention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting down the information in his hand, Hudson took a breath, and he admitted that he had increased his knowledge again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the situation of the countries on the mainland, anyway, it has nothing to do with him for a while, the key is that the orc empire has begun to prepare for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just these things would trouble him at most, but definitely wouldn't surprise him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    South invasion is as simple as eating and sleeping for orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost all the higher races of orcs will participate in the southern invasion. It would not be complete without the animal life that invaded the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem is that this military expansion and preparation for war was first initiated from the Bimon Royal Court. The old Beamon Emperor unexpectedly did not object this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, it was a compromise to the main combat faction in order to push Prince Alex to the throne, but Hudson knew that this explanation was pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A crown prince who eats, drinks and has fun, if you want him to succeed to the throne safely, the best way is to do nothing instead of running to start a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bimeng Emperor is not young, and has already exceeded the normal limit of Bimeng.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If during the war, Emperor Beamon suddenly lost his foot, how could Crown Prince Alex rely on to stabilize the situation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, there must be a demon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know what Emperor Beamon wants to play this time, but the pace of war is approaching. If a coquettish old man who is near the end of his lifespan goes crazy, no one knows what will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this weird situation, it is inevitable for the kingdom to actively respond. Every time the orcs invade in an all-round way, it is a test for the Alpha Kingdom, and if you are not careful, the country will be destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You have all read the information. There must be something wrong behind Bimon's sudden change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know exactly what it is, but once the orc invasion breaks out this time, it will definitely not be a trivial matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are two more allies to share the pressure, once the orcs become the main direction of attack, the pressure to bear is still not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is the kingdom's rear area. Once a war breaks out, we will not only provide money and food, but also send troops to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone must do a good job of preparations. In case of a sudden war, the task of sending troops to our southeastern province should be between 150,000 and 250,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although these troops were not sent out all at once, the number of the first batch of expeditionary troops would not be less than 80,000 at least.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the front line is tense during the war, it is normal for the amount of conscription to double.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last full-scale war, after the front line was defeated, the kingdom was at its most critical moment, but it was forced to draw one out of three.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sending the serf who has just put down his **** to the battlefield is simply sending the enemy's head. It is completely taking human life and delaying the attack speed of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same mistake, we must not make it a second time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inviting everyone here today is to hope that you will expand your armaments as much as possible and train as many elite troops as possible before the outbreak of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the standing army, even ordinary serfs now have to participate in military training. Prepare for the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His Majesty's secret order, from now on the kingdom will enter the state of all the soldiers, and welcome this orc invasion with the strongest posture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After you go back, not only must you prepare for war with all your strength, but you must also urge the lords below to expand their armies and prepare for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The secret order cannot be leaked, I don't care how it is implemented, anyway, once the war breaks out, you have to provide me with an army capable of fighting tough battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a race war, and there is no possibility of any conditions. The continent of Aslant follows the law of the jungle, and losers are not qualified to live on this continent! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's words made everyone tremble. Everyone's expressions became serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the people are soldiers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What a crazy idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that it is just a secret order of Caesar III, but it can actually be taken here, which means that the major forces in the kingdom have discussed it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not clear what exactly happened, but Hudson knew that something was going wrong. Obviously, these big forces are aware of the danger, so they made such a big commotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether this plan can be realized in the end. Just making this political gesture is very scary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that if there is a big defeat on the front line, the Alpha Kingdom will really enter the state of all the people. No matter whether they can complete the training or not, the young and strong will be armed and sent to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson finally didn't speak. Racial wars have always been the cruelest, either you die or you die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation on the mainland is turbulent. If after the outbreak of the Great War, all the countries of the human race are caught up in various messy things, the situation may really deteriorate to that point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Preparing for the worst in advance, and pulling all the serfs out for training, is better than being unprepared when the enemy hits the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the king's secret order, we will naturally implement it. But the problem is that it takes a lot of money to bring the whole people into the scope of training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our families can basically afford this expense, and we can get through it by gritting our teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question is what about the little nobles below?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Last year, we just suffered from the locust plague, and everyone's grain reserves have dropped a lot. Some small nobles who are not wealthy may find it difficult to bear this burden. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the front line of the entry of the locust army, the loss of Arbor County directly ranked the highest in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was the food in the fields gone, but even many wooden houses were eaten by locusts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The granaries of some unlucky nobles were broken into by the army of locusts, and they were directly ransacked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good boss, he naturally has to give consideration to the younger brothers. It would be very hurtful to ignore the actual situation and follow orders mechanically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson found himself connoted, and he was the poorest present. \"Basically able to afford it\", in other words: the Koslow family can't afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are pros and cons to everything, so many people have to train, weapons and equipment are always indispensable, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats are all good people. Seeing that the big aristocrats have begun to expand their armies and prepare for war, and they have been organized for large-scale military training, and they still don't feel the danger, then don't mess around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In times of crisis, it is natural to strengthen the strength. No matter how low-quality iron weapons are, they are more lethal than holding a wooden stick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the business gets better, it will naturally be a lot of money. At that time, he, Master Hudson, will also not be short of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Viscount Oran is right. The impact of the locust plague last year has not yet completely passed. It is still uncertain how the summer crop will be harvested this season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in some hard-hit counties, food is the first big problem to be solved if serfs are to be included in the training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to come to His Majesty's order, and it's not just for the southeastern province. When all the provinces in the kingdom will be trained, the increased food consumption will definitely not be a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Domestic food prices are likely to be pushed up. Aristocrats who are not wealthy may find it difficult to afford this expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better fulfill His Majesty's order, I suggest that the Governor's Office purchase a batch of grain from overseas to stabilize the price of grain in the province. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson followed up with the proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he glanced at Viscount Kayo, signaling to follow quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the 15 counties in the southeastern province, Wright and Wyton counties are the most economically difficult. Even Arbor County, which was hit hardest by the disaster, is much better off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food prices skyrocketed, and it was true that the northern nobles suffered the most, but the local nobles also felt bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking Hudson himself as an example, he purchases a large amount of food every year. If you don't want to pay a high price, you have to owe favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss can't bear it, and the life of the younger brothers is even more difficult. Now that this kind of thing is encountered again, I have to fight for one or two for the younger brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson has long wanted to purchase food from overseas. Persevering, not only has no port, but also no fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the overseas trade in the southeastern province is in the hands of the Dalton family, and several other middle-class nobles have followed suit to get a share of the pie, but there is no Koslow family who has just returned to the ranks of middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't finish it by yourself, you can only pin your hopes on the Governor's Palace. Only when the price of grain in the province stabilizes, the mountainous areas will have the opportunity to purchase and stockpile in large quantities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe aware of his hint, Viscount Cayo frowned, hesitated for a while, and said bravely: \"Your Excellency, Viscount Hudson's proposal is good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Food security is critical. Although my southeast province is not short of food, there are too few nobles who are willing to sell food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stabilize food prices, I propose that the Governor's Mansion provide a limited amount of affordable food in units of counties, and then everyone present will take it back and distribute it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Cayo didn't want to make this suggestion. If the matter is not put on the table and the Dalton family controls the grain trade, the benefits he can gain will only be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, based on his understanding of his uncle, in front of everyone, it is impossible for Earl Pierce to refuse such a proposal that is conducive to the fulfillment of the king's secret order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Political correctness\", this is the rule that big shots must follow. Especially at this moment when unity is needed, we should not do anything that would harm unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since this is the case, Viscount Cayo naturally wants to show himself. Wighton County is not completely controlled by him, and this batch of cheap food is undoubtedly a sharp weapon to win people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is proposed to distribute the supply of cheap food to everyone present, and by the way, it can be sold to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the position ranking, you can know the status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is the governor's nephew, he can only add to the end. Hudson, who is also a rookie, was placed in the fifth-to-last position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is definitely not the error of the reception official, but the final ranking based on the comprehensive strength of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since it is a manifestation of strength, the order of positions can also reflect the level of speaking power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most vulnerable existence, if you want to gain a foothold in it, you can't go wrong by selling everyone first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe there is also the meaning of showing Earl Pierce. Tell my uncle with practical actions that Kayo's political wisdom is not low, and he has the value of focusing on training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing at everyone, Earl Pierce said with a blank expression: \"Well, I will arrange for someone to implement this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the overseas food prices are still unclear. After adding the shipping fee, the price of the food shipped back may not be lower than the current market price, so you have to be prepared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are short of food, there is still a batch of fish at the port. The price is relatively cheap, you can send people to purchase. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fish, except for special species, most of the wild fish are difficult to be refined in the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The market for marine fish is even smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats who can afford it are not interested in this stuff. Serfs and commoners who are willing to eat these fish have no money in their pockets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except during the war period, when you need to store dried fish and use it as military rations, most of the time fish products are not popular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that fresh fish is inconvenient to transport, and it is easy to pickle and store dried fish. The problem is that the price of salt is too expensive, which directly leads to the fact that all pickled products are not cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Dalton family, which monopolizes the salt trade, these are naturally not a problem. However, the dried fish produced is still not easy to sell in the market except for their own consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce proposed now, naturally not to sell dried fish. Such a small amount of money is not worth thinking about by the princes on his side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real purpose is to warn everyone to keep quiet. In case of a food crisis, he, the boss, will lend a helping hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you can't buy food overseas, the Dalton family is capable of helping to solve everyone's food shortage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fish goods\" may also be \"surplus goods\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Relatively cheap\" clearly means that if you are safe, you can buy cheap goods; if you are restless, you can't buy supplies even if you have money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The almost naked hint, if you can't hear the implication, Hudson is too embarrassed to sit here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't take care of so much. At this juncture, being able to buy enough food is the most important thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price issue, he was already prepared to be slaughtered. As long as the price does not soar to the sky, Hudson is ready to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you really go to the port foolishly, you are really foolish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Price, don't mention it. Anyway, it can't be cheap, but it's not expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of high food prices, the price of meat products is a little bit more expensive, and Hudson can accept it, not to mention that it has been salted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How does it taste? Anyway, Bear Stearns looks disgusted, and it is even more impossible for Hudson to be this \"dried fish eating\" warrior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this also reminds me that it is necessary to reserve a batch of dried meat in advance as military rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an emergency, these highly nutritious foods can also support the army for a longer period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All rely on the kingdom's supplies, and Hudson doesn't think that's a reliable thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that I'm worried about bureaucrats messing up things, the main reason is that the battlefield is changing rapidly, and many accidents are unpredictable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a normal military transfer is not possible, the troops and the food transportation team will pass by. When we meet again, it depends on whether the Lord of Dawn will bless you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Plan ahead, there is still time. The trouble is how to organize everyone to engage in military training for the whole people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from all the county guards, just organize everyone to hold a meeting, do ideological work, and issue orders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, the freshly-baked Wright County military officer, is nominally subject to the restraint of the sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Viscount Sith can be disregarded, after all, the name is not justified. If there is a trouble, it will be a troublesome thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson glanced at the direction of Northern Xinjiang and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, in the name of the county military officer, I am posting to everyone, inviting all the nobles in Wright County to come and participate in the \"Comprehensive Combat against Skull and Bones Security Conference\" in three days.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Excuses are necessary after all, and the news of comprehensive preparations for war cannot be leaked, so the Skeleton Society can only bear everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a cult organization, it is their responsibility to take the blame. Any problems that cannot be solved can be blamed on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The effect has always been very good, and it has gradually become a practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nature of politics is like this. Even though it knows that the national preparations for war are aimed at the orcs, the Alpha Kingdom still cannot admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The responsibility for instigating the war can only be borne by the orcs. Although it seems to have no substantive effect, the moral high ground must still be occupied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"After such a long time, haven't you found out any useful information?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man's question made Karliss very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I think that when he was in the Holy See, he was also an elite figure, and he was straightforward in handling things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After joining the Anti-Catholic organization in the vest of Skull and Bones, the situation changed. From the moment he took over the task of finding the \"Blood Moon Horn\", everything went wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, I checked all the nobles who were most likely to come into contact with the Horn of the Blood Moon that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is only the last one left, and the one who is most suspected...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Karlis finished speaking, the masked man waved his hand and said, \"Since the target has been locked, why hesitate, go and check directly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just finished speaking, the masked man suddenly realized something was wrong, and added:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The closest to the place where Iman died is the Fifth Army. The suspect you are talking about is not that **** Hudson?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis nodded without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't work hard, it's that the mountain leader is too unfriendly to this kind of strange visitor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Going deep into the most basic Baojia system, it is impossible to keep his whereabouts secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only do hotels have to register and report, but even visits to serfs' houses as guests are recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several times I tried to go deep, but I was questioned by patrolling soldiers. After a lot of experience, Karliss also realized that someone had tipped off the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to startle the enemy, Karlis was forced to pretend to be a merchant going to purchase, and purchased a bunch of messy iron products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, he can only operate on the periphery. It is impossible to get close to the Lord's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secret sneaking does not exist, and Karlis doesn't think that his stealth skills have been practiced to the point where he can hide from the earth bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are unlucky and get slapped to death by Xiong Zizi just after passing by, then you will lose a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Getting the exact news, the masked man also had a headache. He also couldn't stand the grown-up Earth Bear in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, it's someone else's territory. Once his identity is revealed, he will be besieged by the army immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pause the action, that **** Hudson is too mysterious. Maybe it is the reincarnation of a fallen evil god, so it is not appropriate to fight him head-on.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the masked man speaks very carefully, there is always a sense of disobedience when the words come out of his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader of the cult formed, and suspected that the enemy is an evil god, which is a bit funny no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the masked man really thinks so. Others don't know what's going on with the Earth Bear, but he knows it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not so easy to directly ripen a young Earth Bear without any side effects causing the bear to rebound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the Holy See, with its deep foundation, can't do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his cognition, only the power of the gods can achieve this step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the words of his granddaughter that day, the masked man quickly connected Hudson with the gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the reincarnated gods, the energy carried in their bodies, could pose a threat to a top powerhouse like him in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The older the rivers and lakes, the less courageous they are.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man really didn't want to provoke someone who was suspected to be the reincarnation of a god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then don't we look for the Horn of the Blood Moon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this \"evil weapon\", the Skull and Bones Society spent all their money. Letting go suddenly is completely inconsistent with the style of a cult organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the rush, we're not the only ones looking for the Horn of the Blood Moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Release the news that the Blood Moon Horn is in the mountains, and the guys from the Holy See will naturally go to find the way for us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one who knows oneself best is always the enemy, especially the enemy composed of internal traitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the masked people who have been in the Holy See are very clear about the style of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if she no longer has the power of the peak period, the innate arrogance is still inherited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Acting style is basically how domineering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous territory is not enough to make the Holy See fearful. After receiving the news, it will definitely come to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Lord, once the Holy See intervenes, don't we have no chance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom agreed, but if they didn't get anything, it might be difficult to pay…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Karliss said rather apprehensively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doing the cause of anti-Holy See is already full of crises. If they offend other big forces, their life will be difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, this is the Alpha Kingdom. At most, the Holy See will quietly send a few experts over to investigate. Once the real identity is revealed, their treatment will not be much better than ours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have experienced how strict the security of the Mountain Territory is. It is not easy to steal the Blood Moon Horn from here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they grab it by force, even if they can get the Blood Moon Horn, they don't even think about taking it out safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main purpose of the Frankish Kingdom is to create trouble for the Holy See. The specific process, the blood moon horn is just a medium.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this stuff doesn't mean much to them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The masked man said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the number one religion in the mainland, the Holy See of Dawn should be respected by the world, but one day it was reduced to the same level as a cult organization, enjoying the treatment of everyone screaming and beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to say that this is a great irony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the identity is really revealed, the Alpha Kingdom is estimated to be more enthusiastic about hunting down members of the Holy See than arresting the Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Alpha Kingdom, but also many countries on the continent of Aslante, are not friendly to the trouble-loving Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the execution of Caesar III's secret order, the war machine of the Alpha Kingdom was soon activated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the urging of all kinds of strange reasons, vigorous military training was held in various places. There are not enough weapons, even if you hold a wooden stick, you have to make a few gestures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, military training is also a kind of technical work. Some nobles train well, but most nobles' military training is like a farce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality of the nobles at the bottom is really not flattering. Not every family has a profound background, and only a few have passed down military knowledge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the soldiers all the way to inspect the progress of the military training of the nobles in the county, Hudson's face was almost green with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I often see a few people holding knives, guns and sticks, practicing gestures there, and the rest are clapping and applauding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is this considered military training?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When thinking of taking such an army to the battlefield, Hudson recalled the rabble coalition army that put down the Skull and Bones rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that this time the enemy is a ferocious orc, unlike the last time, it is enough to compare them directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the Orc Empire, the Alpha Kingdom is the weaker side, and Hudson doesn't have the same mind of paddling and waiting for victory that day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the whole nest, how can there be any eggs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Hudson also has a family and a business, not the poor and white knight of the day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the orc invasion, the little knight who has nothing can sneak away, but as a noble lord, there is no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vital interests are involved, and Hudson has to worry about these \"allies\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are no top students. For example, those guys in the Northland have trained soldiers who look good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the forces behind those guys are too complicated, and there are too many people who have offended billions of points. Hudson doesn't want to get too close to them and cause trouble for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, he would have gone to dig Sith's corner long ago. The so-called Northland camp alliance can't stop his hoe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the case for this military training. He just said hello to those guys, and he didn't bother to pay attention to whether he wanted to execute it or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, the guy who left it alone, on the contrary, overfulfilled the task and pulled all the young and strong out for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles who are highly valued by Hudson appear frequently. It's not that everyone doesn't cooperate, but that their abilities are really limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No way, no way. In the inheritance of most nobles, how to cultivate a small number of elite guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom was forced to fully mobilize in the last all-out war, Hudson knew from the few words in the history book that the result was not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering how miserable the last war was, most of the nobles who participated in the war never returned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are gone, and the experience accumulated on the battlefield, needless to say, will be buried forever underground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, is this how you train soldiers?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought that Baron Cheers, who had been on the battlefield and commanded the Fifth Army, should have learned a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turns out that Hudson is simply thinking too much. The way this guy in front of him trains soldiers is to teach soldiers how to practice fighting spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is meat every day, and some high-energy Warcraft meat is added from time to time, this training method is not too bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the serfs gnaw on the black and hard black bread, which can be used as a wooden stick to smash people, and they have to match it with wild vegetable soup to barely get enough water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the treatment that can only be enjoyed during military training or during busy farming seasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, if you can have a full meal, it is the conscience of the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the nutrition cannot keep up, if you teach the method of cultivation, it is purely killing your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, noble gentlemen also cherish talents. As long as the practice is well-known, the salary can immediately rise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft meat can't be counted on, but it's definitely okay to have a full meal. You can have some meat every day, and you can also have a meal of meat every now and then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that there are only a few people who are talented after all, especially without the assistance of any cultivation resources, even fewer people can cultivate to become famous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few hundred people in Nuo Da's mountainous area who have cultivated Dou Qi so far, and there are many family children among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before suffering from lack of life essence, unable to walk the knightly path, he was forced to switch to fighting qi, which is easy to hurt the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the younger generation is now back on the road of knight training. Everyone looked at Hudson eagerly, counting on him to solve this problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What, is there a problem?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I followed what you said, to train as many elites as possible in the shortest possible time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cheers said as a matter of course.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An army composed of practitioners is definitely the elite of the elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the number is too small, they mix together every day on weekdays, and the tacit understanding cultivated is the best cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of equal strength, the combat effectiveness of this small group of guards obviously surpassed that of ordinary elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the problem is that the number of people is too small to form a scale effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe a big noble like Dalton can form an army of thousands of pure practitioners, but only the small and medium nobles below will definitely not be able to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The problem is big!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What we need is troops that can be trained quickly and have a certain combat effectiveness. The most important thing is to form a scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's like the army I trained in the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Chells, it seems that you also took away a lot of veterans last time, so it's not likely that you will be tossed away so quickly, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's words, Cheers was embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that harvesting a group of veterans would be able to replicate Hudson's military training method, but it turned out that the group of serfs with a single-minded mind learned two words-obedience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The intermittent dictation of the military training process was directly ignored by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all the fault of the northern nobles. When they first came to conflict the year before last, I brought someone to help my friend...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the indignant Baron Cheers, Hudson only felt a toothache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I suddenly understand why the local nobles fought back and forth with the northern Xinjiang nobles at that time. The feeling is that the veterans who have seen blood were also sent to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, I reacted quickly back then and decisively rejected all the invitations, otherwise I didn't know what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers who have undergone rigorous training and won consecutive victories on the battlefield will soon become elites, at least they will consider themselves elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a major defeat is encountered, the commander will not appease the morale of the army in time, and the anger will soon be vented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't hold on to it, you are a veteran. In a downwind battle, one is worth two. Once the front line loses, these guys are also the fastest runners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not even as good as a serf who has just put down his hoe, and can fight hard with the noble lord for a longer time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is also possible that the serfs wanted to run, but they didn't know how to run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, without enough experience, I accidentally rushed to the front with the noble lord, and there was someone blocking the way behind me if I wanted to run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, tell me the truth. If you are so anxious to ask everyone to train the army, is something wrong on the front line in northern Xinjiang?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Cheers asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are not fools. At the beginning, everyone suspected that Hudson was planning to make trouble and waited for an opportunity to squeeze out the Sith Sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as the news spread, after all the nearby counties issued similar orders, everyone guessed that something happened on the front line of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was because of this terrible guess that everyone actively organized serfs for training. Otherwise, the order of the military officer in the county will not work well in front of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Cheers, don't ask me this, because if you ask, the skeleton will make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other things, you can guess for yourself, anyway, I will not admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I guess you have heard it too. After the meeting held by the Governor's Mansion, the entire southeastern province has moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the southeastern province, but the entire Alpha Kingdom is the same now. In order to crack down on the cult organization, the Kingdom is going all out this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The content of the meeting cannot be disclosed, but it does not mean that the facts cannot be stated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Alpha Kingdom is indeed in motion. As for which cult organization is being attacked, it depends on Cheers himself to understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having received a definite answer, Baron Cheers' complexion suddenly turned ugly. The last illusion is shattered and disaster is imminent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Baron Cheers said again: \"It seems that the matter has come to this point, it really cannot be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All previous wars were mixed based on regions, but we also have strong autonomy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County will definitely send troops when the Northern Frontier War begins. Presumably, most of the local nobles will choose to join your subordinates to go out together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone is about to go to the battlefield together, you should work hard and simply gather everyone's troops for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is allowed to play freely, and finally bring a group of mobs to the battlefield, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

More people must make similar requests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Help in military training, but it can't be done in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't have to accept goods, but when a war breaks out, you must first clarify which side you want to join.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no time to train for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not your own soldiers, don't follow yourself to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who is full to do such a thankless thing?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the news that should be released have been released. Anyone with a little brain knows that something is probably going to happen in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs invaded the south and took a group of mobs to the battlefield, which was purely irresponsible for their own lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats may not care about the life and death of the serfs, but there are very few who can not care about their own life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the extremely high death rate on the northern battlefield in the past, if you plunge into it without hugging a thigh, the probability of being able to come back alive is simply slim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, among the thighs, Hudson belongs to the most inconspicuous one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength is mediocre, far inferior to the big nobles, and even among the middle nobles, they are at the middle and lower levels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any background to rely on, even on the battlefield, it is difficult to get a good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of disadvantages, but there are also many advantages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has a good reputation, is good at training and fighting, he will not betray his teammates if he is loyal, and the most important thing is good luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Luck\" is very metaphysical, but I have to believe it. Following a lucky boss, the probability of survival is definitely higher than following an unlucky boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This point was actually reflected when the Skull and Bones rebellion was suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of the Fifth Army was miserable, but the private army of the family who had been with Hudson had participated in the most battles, but had the lowest casualty rate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Hudson took over all the serf soldiers, the casualty rate also plummeted. The most important thing is - never lost a battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for Hudson himself to tell the outside world about paddling for fish. Just judging from the final result, he is definitely a lucky star.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to deliberately announcing this aspect, everyone is envious and jealous of Master Hudson's super good luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern border battlefield is full of various risks, and even the great nobles may be wiped out. In the history of the Alpha Kingdom, there were not just one or two great nobles who declined because of resisting the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Decline does not mean demise. As heroes of the kingdom, as long as these families are not too unlucky, the blood can still continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Viscount Oran that Hudson is most familiar with, his ancestors were a great nobleman in the kingdom, and he was once the well-known \"King of the Southeast\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that with the heavy losses on the battlefield, I had to abandon a large number of sites and retreat to the ancestral land to cultivate and live.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many similar nobles, and those who can be passed down are considered lucky. The unlucky ones who were really unlucky all disappeared into the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss is so miserable, one can imagine the younger brothers who follow along. One's own death is nothing, but the destruction of one's family is the worst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, choosing who to fight with is a gamble on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as the boss can come back alive, the younger brothers who hang out with him can continue the family inheritance even if they die in battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobles, no matter how fierce the infighting is, there is still a fig leaf. Taking care of the family members of Paoze in the past is also the right thing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The premise is: there is no crime of conceived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the interests involved are too great, and it is only for the face of the noble lord, then it is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no need to worry, the fiefdom in the hands of the minor nobles will most likely not be enough for the \"crime of pregnant jade\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After each major reshuffle, a large number of unclaimed lands will emerge, waiting for everyone to carve up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What you should be most worried about is not the lack of fiefs, but your own limited strength and inability to occupy more fiefs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many lessons learned from the past, unless there is a reason to choose. Otherwise, it would be impossible for everyone to leave his \"chosen son\"'s thigh and run to follow the guy with uncertain luck to win a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It took two years to manage the reputation, and now it is finally time to realize it, and Hudson has become more rational.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy for everyone to follow his script and hand over the power to train and command the army. But it is not so easy to integrate the team and train an elite division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difficulty of real training lies not with the serf soldiers, but with the nobles and gentlemen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little brother needs training, and the officer also needs training. Letting the noble gentlemen put down their airs and go to the training ground together is more uncomfortable than killing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything has exceptions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, this kind of thing must not have been discussed, but it may not be the case now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment of life and death, many seemingly important bottom lines can be broken down infinitely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's embarrassing to stand alone with the soldiers for training, but when a group of people keep up with them, it becomes “as it should be”.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules always serve the makers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a big deal to modify the rules of the game because of the interests of the makers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it cannot represent all the nobles, within the small circle, it is already possible to play like that.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone doesn't tell these things, it will be a forever dusty secret that has been sealed in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sacred Mountain of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by a piece of shocking news, it came from the Alpha Kingdom, and the top officials of the Holy See immediately exploded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The blood moon horn has appeared!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It even appeared in the Alpha Kingdom. It seems to have fallen into the hands of the mountain lord—Viscount Hudson.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information is too detailed, it is hard not to make people suspect that this is someone who is secretly planning to do something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the \"Blood Moon Horn\" involved too much. As a religious organization, even if everyone knows that the Holy See has connections with cult organizations, the Holy See cannot admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it would be a big trouble for believers to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See of Chenxi has attracted so much hatred, but it can still exist and live a comfortable life. A large part of the reason is that it has a huge group of believers on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it can't fool the big nobles, it still has a lot of influence in the minds of the people at the bottom and some small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries are constantly making small moves, but they have never taken action to destroy the Holy See. Apart from being afraid of the gods, they are also worried about the reaction of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the reputation of the Holy See can be completely defeated, the Holy See of Dawn can be labeled as a cult organization, and the foundation of the Holy See can be completely broken, all countries will not give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Twice if it doesn't work once, and three, four, five, six, seven or eight times if it doesn't work twice, everyone will do it whenever there is a chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chenxi Vatican has a lot of black history, and if it increases over time, it will eventually lead to the collapse of the basic market one day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blake, what do you think of this matter?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is increasingly dissatisfied with the performance of the Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disaster was caused by the Knights of Judgment. Even if the relevant responsible persons were dealt with, the aftermath work was still a mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the Knights of Judgment's actions in the Orc Empire had begun to bear fruit, and that they were about to invade the Alpha Kingdom southward, I'm afraid Pius VII's face would have been even more ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the group, Blake's mood at the moment is more complicated than that of Pius VII. Because of the \"Blood Moon Horn\", he has long been exhausted physically and mentally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether you want to investigate, but after falling out with the Alpha Kingdom, their people basically never return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very difficult for people to get out of the body, and the aftermath work will naturally not be completed. Even the Beastman Empire was purely a coincidence, which seemed to provoke a dispute between the two countries, but in fact it had nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce my responsibility, I bit the bullet and took the credit. It's just that the fake ones are fake after all, and the situation in the Orc Empire is not under his control at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the goal of the orc empire's southward invasion is not the Alpha Kingdom, but to find a breakthrough from the other two countries' weak links, Blake doesn't know how to end it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of troubles were mixed together, which was enough for him to have a headache, but now the message of \"Blood Moon Horn\" suddenly appeared, he simply didn't want to let people live.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the news of the Blood Moon Horn came out too suddenly. Evil weapons are not easy to control. For nobles who cherish their reputation, this thing is a tasteless thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a little viscount, if he has this kind of thing in his hand, what he should do is turn it over to the Alpha Kingdom instead of holding it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is really in the hands of this person, the news will be strictly sealed. Now there is a sudden news that someone is probably leading us there on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, the mountain lord is not an ordinary person. Not only the elite division with two infantry regiments, but also an adult Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of any big forces. From the moment Hudson stepped out of the house, he became a viscount from an unknown little knight in less than two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends not on ability, but on that terrifying luck. It is said that no matter what happens to this person, it will become...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this guy is tough. Guys who conflict with him will encounter all kinds of unexpected accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the son of a grand duke, they were all suppressed to death by this person. Even before Hudson did anything, the development of the situation automatically pushed him up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we are in conflict with the Frankish Kingdom, it is not appropriate to provoke new enemies until the matter is over. The Alpha Kingdom has its own orcs to clean up, so there is absolutely no need for us to do it ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the matter of the Blood Moon Horn, it is enough to send someone to secretly investigate first. It is not appropriate to act with great fanfare, so as not to cause a strong reaction from the Alpha Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the Horn of the Blood Moon from the Alpha Kingdom is full of too many uncertainties. Especially in the case of leaking news, they can hear the news, and how could the snakes know nothing about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a game deliberately set up by the enemy, it would be a tragedy to wait for them to send it to your door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of failures, Blake's confidence has long been gone. In order to mitigate the impact of failure, simply tout the \"goal\" first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal for you to be unable to win when you meet a \"son of luck\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where are the countless classic cases in history, where anyone who meets a particularly lucky guy will die in an ugly way in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was the Holy See in its heyday, it would still be fearless. No matter how powerful the enemy is, they can find a way to grind it to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the current Holy See can't do it. If he was tossing around unscrupulously, the vitality he had just recovered would be exhausted soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just flattering the enemy, Blake didn't think it was enough, and by the way, he dragged the Frankish Kingdom into the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most powerful country in the mainland, no one can ignore it. In fact, after declaring the Frankish king illegitimate, Pius VII was quick to regret it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is not like that. It's refreshing to turn your face directly, but the final result is a bit touching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they overestimated the influence of the Holy See. They thought that without their recognition, the other party would not be able to secure the throne, and finally had to compromise with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never would have thought that without him, the pope, to be crowned, people actually put on the crown by themselves, completely trampling the majesty of the Holy See under their feet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, arrange for an archbishop to make sense of it. Even if the archbishop is appointed by the king, Pius VII can grit his teeth and admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that none of these are available. The arrogant Franks don't play with such nonsense at all. He didn't even bother to leave the last fig leaf for the Holy See, and told the world directly: The replacement of the throne does not require the approval of the Church.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without a doubt, this definitely opened Pandora's box. The Frankish Kingdom cannot be suppressed, and the status of the Holy See must plummet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Blake fiercely, Pius VII turned his head and asked everyone, \"What's your opinion?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See, which has a serious bureaucratic atmosphere, has long since degenerated to \"who proposes, who is responsible\". In this uncertain situation, no one among a group of old foxes is willing to plunge themselves into it rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the matter of the Horn of the Blood Moon has always been in charge of the Judgment Knights. The relevant information is in their hands, let them continue to be responsible!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority right now is the Frankish Kingdom. The intention of the newly succeeded King of France to be hostile to us is too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that they are still plotting to establish a new pope. If we let him go on, I'm afraid it will be very bad for us. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei on the side opened his mouth and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old enemy, at this critical moment, how can he, the head of the Judgment Knights, not make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more the Knights of Judgment do not want to take over this mess, the more they want to tie them together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the incident of the Horn of the Blood Moon, the life of the Judgment Knights has been much easier in the past year or so.

Train Officers First\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is not the only one that has entered the battle preparation mode. After receiving the news of the changes in the Orc Empire, the Kingdom of Warhammer and the Principality of Moxi also raised their combat readiness levels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For orcs, the Three Kingdoms are all human nations, and robbing anyone is robbing. Once there is a fight in the north, none of the three families will be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there was no grievance in the first place, after being patronized by orcs one after another, the hatred accumulated over time made them regard the orcs as their mortal enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the Kingdom of Warhammer and the Principality of Moxi have only experienced small-scale invasions, and have not yet experienced the horror of a full-scale orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past all-out wars, the Alpha Kingdom was at the forefront, and when the war spread to their doorstep, it was all in the middle and late stages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the middle and late stages, the countries of the human race have almost reacted. The reinforcements from all corners of the country came together, and the fight could not be said to be smooth, at least it was not a one-sided beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't have coping experience, you can only learn from your neighbors. Seeing the Alpha Kingdom mobilize the whole country, the two countries were also very frightened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are the orcs really going to launch a full-scale invasion?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX asked with a gloomy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both are \"gatekeepers\", so there are strengths and weaknesses. If we say that among the Three Kingdoms, the Alpha Kingdom, which has been fighting against the orcs for a long time, is the strongest, then the Principality of Moxi, which is in the narrow gap, is at the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though the Principality of Moxi once had the reputation of \"the first principality in the mainland\" and its military strength is stronger than some weaker kingdoms, it is a pity that it is still not enough in front of the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The usual small-scale harassment made them tired of coping. Now that he was suddenly told that the Orc Empire was going to invade in an all-round way, it was hard for Chris IX to accept it without slowing down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the orcs are about to launch a full-scale invasion, this is news from the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have fought with orcs for hundreds of years, and they have a deep understanding of the orc empire. This judgment should not be wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, judging from the information we have received from the Orc Empire, the five imperial courts of the Orcs are all preparing for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is not a total war, this war is far from comparable to the past. It is always right to prepare for the worst in advance so as not to be caught off guard when you get hit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg replied with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs invaded in an all-round way. Although the three unlucky guys were beaten together, the most dangerous one was the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the weakest existence among the three kingdoms, it is very likely to become a breakthrough for the orc army to invade the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are dense fortresses on the border, Herceg still has no idea whether the Principality of Moxi can block the attack of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both are \"bad brothers\", the Alpha Kingdom and the Warhammer Kingdom must be hopeless. According to the experience of previous conflicts, the orcs' main attack in one direction will not pull down the other two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happened that the military strength of the Orc Empire was higher than that of the Three Kingdoms, so even if the three were caught and beaten together, there would not be much pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's prepare for the battle with all our strength! The Alpha Kingdom doesn't even let go of the pitiful fighting power of the serfs, and we must keep up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chris IX said with gritted teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It won't work if you don't follow up with all your strength. As the weakest existence among the three kingdoms, the Principality of Moxi is likely to suffer the worst beating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case of failure to block the front of the orc army, the country will be ruined and the family will be destroyed in an instant. Even if Chris IX can personally go into exile abroad, it is very difficult for the destroyed country to get it back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the orc army is too ruthless. Although the land we passed was not to the point where not a single blade of grass grew, it was inevitable that ten rooms would be empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nationals are gone, and the restoration of the country is naturally a joke. When it comes to competition for the survival space of races, it is purely extravagant to expect the opponent to be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Emerald Palace, the chariot of war started to turn, but Caesar III was idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is in the service of the war, and the trivial things disappear from his sight. The nobles who are full of conflicts are no longer tossing at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a life-and-death enmity, the hatred must be suppressed now. Everyone has only one purpose to concentrate their strength - to survive this catastrophe of life and death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of hatred, it depends on whether the opponent can survive the ensuing war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, the probability of the opponent dying on the battlefield is much higher than the success rate of killing the opponent by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things suddenly became less. While relaxing, Caesar III was still a little unaccustomed to it. Of course, it's more that I don't know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He clamored fiercely, wanting to avenge the orcs and regain lost ground. In fact, he panicked a lot in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the changes in the orc empire first, he was sure that this war was inevitable, so he didn't want to go to war with the orcs at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there are signs of locust plagues in the Orc Empire and the Quecinian Peninsula at the same time. It is only a matter of time before a large-scale outbreak occurs. Our first step plan has succeeded.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said in a deep voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that this was playing with fire. Simultaneously, the two major forces are under attack, and the blood is licked properly. A little carelessness will be a big accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what is even more cruel is that no matter whether the Alpha Kingdom takes action or not, the fact that they are hostile to each other cannot be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Relax, my prime minister. Things are not that bad, the Holy See has just offended the Frankish Kingdom to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one will act as a peacemaker for them this time. The troubles that the First Kingdom on the mainland can cause them are not so easy to solve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Orc Empire, they are all preparing to invade, so why hesitate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as their war potential can be weakened, it is worthwhile to go to war now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was flustered in my heart, but I had to show enough calmness to appease the hearts of my subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland also said similar words to his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows it's just soothing words, but they still want to hear it. When people have no bottom in their hearts, they need approval the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if this kind of recognition has no substantive meaning, it can still obtain spiritual comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III, who is good at playing politics, will naturally not disappoint his subordinates in this regard. If the boss has no confidence, wouldn't the subordinates be even more panicked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of large-scale war involving the survival of the race not only needs to be taken seriously by the Alpha Kingdom, but also by the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just fighting with the three border countries of the human race is really nothing to the orcs, but the human race has dozens of countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    how to spell?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When will you play?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To what extent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are all knowledge, in case of careless operation, the whole human race will be offended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the ruthless overlord of the mainland can destroy an orc empire at all costs, he can still do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So every time the orcs invaded, they mainly robbed. When it comes to seizing territory, they are quite restrained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this restraint is passive. In the later stages of previous wars, almost all of them ended with the allied forces of the human race regaining the lost territory. The war will not end without relinquishing the captured lands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last great war was an exception, and this exception was based on the background of the human race fighting on all sides. The orc empire, which took advantage of it, also paid a heavy price, that is, it threw off its allies and made an early truce with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar betrayals and alliances are very common among races. If all the alien races were united, the human race's position as the overlord of the mainland would have been pulled down long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The upcoming southward invasion seems to be an accidental event, but in fact, it is unknown how many political games have been experienced behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after weighing the pros and cons many times and feeling that war is more beneficial to him, did the orc court make the decision to launch a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the missions sent by the Principality of Moxie and the Kingdom of Warhammer have already set off and are expected to arrive at the capital in half a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They came here this time, mostly to discuss joint operations. This matter involves a lot, and you need to come up with the charter yourself. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Alpha Kingdom, most of the time he has nothing to do, except during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the previous Minister of Foreign Affairs, Earl Francis's task is even heavier. This time, there are two more allies who need to coordinate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lips are cold and the teeth are dead. Now the three countries are all \"brothers\" in the trenches. If anyone falls, the other two countries will become more dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as we can, we still need to take care of each other when we are on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, if the orc army breaks through any country, they can turn to the rear to launch an attack, thus avoiding the densely packed fortresses on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the Ministry of Military Affairs coordinate with them, and cooperate with them if they can, but everything must be based on the safety of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, let the frontier provinces be more vigilant, and use the noble castle as a hub to secretly build a line of defense. In the event of an accident, we must buy enough time for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister, you are responsible for leading the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Government Affairs, and the Noble Council to jointly form an inspection team to supervise the combat readiness of each province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell them, which province has the slowest combat readiness and the worst army training, let the army of that province take the lead! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar III said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autonomy of the fiefdom nobles is indeed high, but it does not mean that the king has nothing to do with them. Especially in this war period, wearing small shoes is even easier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and the war was about to break out. If you don't work hard now, even if you want to work hard later, you will have no chance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are two more unlucky guys to share the pressure, it also increases uncontrollable factors. In case the two allies can't stand it, the Alpha Kingdom's originally shortened battle line will be lengthened again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the nobles are responsible for guarding the land these days, and they are not afraid that the fief lords in the frontier provinces will not work hard, otherwise it will be difficult to improvise a line of defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County, since Hudson took over the military training of a group of \"allies\", the scene has become grand in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the premise of not including the noble territories of the Northland, there are 50,000 young men in Wright County. Just hearing this number really shocked Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon he calmed down, it was all the good work of the former Fifth Army colleagues. Not only did they bring over the young men from the Wright County territory, but they also brought over the young men from their original hometown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the halo is that powerful. Although Hudson's reputation was made by them together, everyone recognized Hudson's luck and training ability from the bottom of their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, you have to bring your own dry food training team, so naturally you need to find a capable person to help with training. The more elite the soldiers are trained, the higher the survival rate of everyone on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"50,000 young and strong\" is only defined in terms of age. Naturally, it is impossible for all of them to be suitable for military service, and it is necessary to screen them once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the whole country is prepared to serve as soldiers, it is impossible for the kingdom to send all the young and strong to the battlefield. Most of them are playing the role of emergency reserve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's estimate, the Kingdom's call-up order will draw at most 7,000 to 10,000 people from here, and there is a high probability that they will not be sent to the front line at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these people, the various branches of the Koslow family in the province also brought young and strong people to refer to the training. Some family friends and relatives who were preparing to form a team also brought people over to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are more people who want to rely on relationships and come to military training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing an increasingly large team, Hudson was so frightened that he stopped immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really limited in ability, even if you send a regiment of your own to be an instructor, there are not enough manpower. If there is more, then there is really no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the kind of great master who recruits hundreds of thousands of recruits at one time and directly trains them into an army, Hudson only has Mobike.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he has a foundation, throwing hundreds of thousands of young men in front of him now, he still has a look of bewilderment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, most of the serf soldiers only need to think about it and have a certain foundation. He only needs to select 10,000 to 20,000 people for key training as an army for future expeditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the area of ​​non-cultivated land in the mountainous area is also large enough. A military camp can be placed on each mountain, and people can be dispersed without feeling crowded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for building roads and leveling the land, it's not that Master Hudson wants to take advantage of it, it's entirely for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the mountainous territory, who would be willing to use such a large piece of land as a training ground for young adults?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without roads, grain cannot be transported in. The field is uneven, so it is inconvenient to train!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the weapons in the hands of the young and strong, they were not promoted by Hudson, but everyone followed the example after seeing the serfs in the mountain collar holding one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from selling only low-quality weapons in the past, this wave of Hudson has mixed and matched many high-quality weapons according to the ratio of five to one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only disadvantage is that they are still out of stock. Only the most valued \"future elites\" get iron weapons, and the rest can only use wooden sticks to fill up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large-scale military purchases are also a heavy burden for small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for Hudson's generous expression: his own people can pay on credit, or they can charge the account in kind. It is estimated that most of the nobles will passively give up because of their lack of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stand still!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stand firm for me. Now that you're here, be prepared to suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't worry about embarrassment, we all have the same training, no one will laugh at you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are all aristocrats, so you have to show the appearance of aristocrats. If you can't even compare to serfs, wouldn't you be afraid of shame if you spread the word?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, in the next month, everyone must cheer up and follow the study seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One month later, we will go back to train the serfs. They are also being trained. If they can't even compare with serfs, they can just wipe their necks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's still too late to quit now, once the training starts, it's too late to regret it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let me get to know you first, the one on my shoulder is Mr. Bear Stearns, the great earth bear. Next, your training will be supervised by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This Mr. Bear Stearns has a bad temper, so you'd better not make him angry. Although there are priests in the barracks, I can't guarantee whether the treatment will be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Train soldiers first and train officers first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to take everyone to the battlefield, you can't do it without some real skills. If his subordinates are full of useless materials, it is easy to kill him, the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about being stolen by others. These basic training methods can at best train low-level officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles can learn it in a short period of time, because they have cultural background and have mastered more knowledge than ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has personally experienced the training of a poor and white serf officer. It took a full two years to barely meet his requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to take care of everyone's face, Hudson also specially set up a noble training camp, and all the participants are noble children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elderly nobleman couldn't bear to accept training, so he pushed his sons out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Exit\" is just a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities to learn military knowledge are rare. If anyone dares to quit halfway, Hudson doesn't need to do anything, and the old father will hand them over to them after death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the oversight of Bear Stearns, that was just plain scary. Even if the cubs are willing to come out to work for free, Hudson is afraid of problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Xiong, who is neither serious nor serious, even Hudson himself is afraid once he starts to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case Uncle Xiong slaps down and accidentally kills a few, Hudson has no way to explain it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just Uncle Xiong's hoarse grinning, eager expression, which is really a bit irritating...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After all, Hudson is also famous for being able to play in the southeastern province. The key is that no one informed him from the beginning to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's clear that the local nobles don't want to take him to play. There is no excuse for wanting to make a fuss. The Governor's Mansion held a military meeting, and it made sense for military officers to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the military officer in the county, Hudson organized the fiefdom lords to conduct military training, which also complied with the regulations in terms of procedures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that other county guards are more powerful and have a strong say in the military. They often crowd out the power of military officers, and even directly take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others can do it, but it doesn't mean Sith can do it too. In the three-acre area of ​​Wright County, the strongest military force is the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neither the two infantry regiments nor the cute bear is something he can fight against.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to ask your hometown for help, the Felix family has no shortage of troops and strong men, but these have nothing to do with his illegitimate son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Grand Duke Kavadia has great face, he has no way to assign the top powerhouse of the family to his illegitimate son. Especially at this moment when the orcs could come over at any time, it would be more likely to cause criticism if they were to withdraw their strength and leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to stop it in terms of rules and procedures, and unable to suppress it in terms of strength, Viscount Sith could only watch helplessly as the mountain leader practiced his troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only Viscount Sith who is worried, but all the noble children of the Northland are very troubled by this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles in the county sent 50,000 young and strong at a time. Even with just a little training, the balance of military strength between the two sides will be out of balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, with the rise of the Mountain Territory, the balance of military strength in Wright County has long been reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles, who were originally at a disadvantage, overtook them. Forced to do so, everyone can only work hard to train serfs, trying not to let this gap continue to widen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without counting the mountain territory, the areas controlled by the two sides are almost the same, but there is an obvious gap in the number of young and strong owned by the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, my hometown is still too far away. Although everyone tried every means to increase the population, they still couldn't keep up with the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Viscount Sith, please think of a way! If the current situation continues, we will be kicked out sooner or later!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Justin Knight said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a down-to-earth unlucky guy, he has been unlucky these days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, they suffered heavy losses during the locust plague, and then they were caught while robbing the caravan. Before he recovered, another slave rebellion broke out in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dilapidated territory did not break him down, but the attitude of the neighbors made him terrified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serf soldiers taunted him before they were trained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that the June debt must be repaid quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no gratuitous hatred, these ridicules all stem from previous conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the strength is not good, you can only endure it; the strength comparison has changed, so you will not be so polite!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they didn't come over to do something, it was because the local nobles were not ready, and by the way, they also took care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the serf soldiers form an army, can the local nobles continue to exercise restraint?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This question already has an answer in everyone's mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Justin Knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now what we should worry about is not the little conflict with the nobles in the county, but to take a long-term view.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in northern Xinjiang is tense, you must have heard about it. Almost certain - the war has entered the countdown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a fight breaks out in the north, everyone will inevitably go to the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have all fought against orcs, and everyone knows how powerful the enemy is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In every all-out war, our Alpha Kingdom will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the joy of the local nobles, they will suffer in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of grievances, even if there is a liquidation, it will have to wait until after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current strength gap is large, but it does not mean that the future strength gap will also be large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the local nobles who know almost nothing about orcs, our survival rate in the war is much higher. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith tried his best to appease him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The imbalance of military strength has become a reality. The local aristocrats didn't call back to find a place, they were all taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they take the initiative to do something, they are looking for a beating. The beating was in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to make him appear incompetent as the boss, Sith can only ask everyone to take a longer view and shift their attention to the upcoming war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War is the best way to turn things around. With the horrible casualty rate of previous wars, big forces are likely to overthrow, let alone a bunch of small nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everyone present is a smart person. This kind of reassuring words obviously can't make everyone feel relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the battlefield, the local nobles will certainly suffer heavy casualties, but that doesn't mean they will be able to retreat unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To survive in a war of this level, one has to fight for strength or luck. For most people with insufficient strength, luck comes first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Sith, according to past practice, most of the kingdom's conscripts are based on regions to form troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this situation, the local nobles will definitely not act with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just with us alone, even if the nobles from the two counties are added together, I am afraid that they will not be able to make up a legion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Contradictions belong to contradictions. At this time, we still need to help each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least until the local nobles accept him, the alliance of children of the northern nobles cannot collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one huddled together to keep warm, and became a little lord without roots, but it was difficult to survive on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The window paper was punctured, and the matter was put on the bright side. Viscount Sith, who was originally taboo about this matter, had to come out to face it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, deep down in his heart, he still has some regrets. If he had known earlier that the situation in northern Xinjiang would take a turn for the worse, he would not have designed to weaken the \"allies\" in order to compete for dominance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you can't make up a legion, you have to make it up. The military establishment during the war is not static.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A small army can have only a few thousand people, but a large army can have tens of thousands of people. There are no strict requirements in itself, but the most commonly used establishment is 10,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles in the southeastern province have too much prejudice against us, and it is difficult to change in a short time. If you don't want to be cannon fodder on the battlefield, you must strive for as much autonomy as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Sith said firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the decision he finally made after careful consideration. Rather than mixing with other people, it is better to do it alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the strength of the northern nobles has been weakened, there are still more than 2,000 elites. With a few thousand serf soldiers, they can also form an independent army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of combat effectiveness, it may indeed be a little bit worse, but at least a certain degree of autonomy can be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle lines between the Alpha Kingdom and the Orc Empire stretched for thousands of miles, and it was very difficult to unify the command. According to the actual situation, sub-regional operations are inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least a few legions, as many as dozens of legions, is a war zone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The head of the legion is already considered a middle-level leader on the battlefield. At the very least, hold an important military meeting, where you can get a place in it and express your opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves the right to speak in the war, and the Sith is bound to win the position of legion commander, and it is absolutely impossible to make any concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To achieve this, it is inseparable from the full support of the children of the northern nobles. The local aristocrats gathered for training in the mountainous area, which of course brought him pressure, but it was also an opportunity for Sith to consolidate his basic base.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside Beida City, a special convoy just entered the city, and was warmly welcomed by the people in the city, including some noble children.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone in the convoy has long been familiar with this scene. As the most well-known singer group in the mainland, the idol in the entertainment industry is the overlord, the ceiling of the idol world, this scene has been seen too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of lack of entertainment, music and stage performances are the most popular entertainment methods at present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an idol group that travels around the mainland, Rainbow Moon Divas has gained countless fans since their debut.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to roam the mainland for a long time without being disturbed by the outside world, the background of the Rainbow Moon Singer Group is naturally not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the founders are several top powerhouses in the mainland. Some singers in the singer group also have unclear relationships with many great nobles on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pornographic news surrounding Diva Group has never stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many big names involved, and the number of singers who dare to provoke them naturally becomes less.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although beautiful women cannot be said to be everywhere, there is no need to cause unnecessary trouble for a few women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss, it seems that you are very popular here? Many noble talents are calling your name outside.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the maid said, Isabel in the luxurious carriage rolled her eyes directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the top names of Rainbow Moon Divas, Isabel naturally has no shortage of fans. Similar scenes appear almost everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's so exciting! After all, they are not from the same world. No matter how obsessed they are, they just want to have fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Windsor, don't take these men's words seriously. The love they are clamoring for now is just lip service. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the trace of unwillingness between the brows, but it still betrays the true thoughts in the heart. The hierarchy in the continent of Aslante is too strict, and the status of the most popular singer is not very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention marrying into a wealthy family, even if it is a core child of a middle-class nobleman, it is impossible to marry a singer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not discrimination by origin, the key is that there is no \"marriage\" value. Just some popularity is worthless to the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The down-and-out nobles are willing to marry them, but very few succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are people who get together, it is not because of love, but more because of the needs of interests. The main reason is to please the big shots, commonly known as the Pan Xia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any popular singer who is used to seeing the big world is very confused about her future. Wealthy families can't get in, and being a lover is not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This \"unreconciled heart\" made Isabel secretly join a mysterious organization. Entering the Alpha Kingdom Xunyou performance this time is to carry out the order of the organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, she didn't want to take on this difficult task, but the people behind gave it too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Money, Isabel is not short of. As cash cows, top singers like them have a very high status in Rainbow Moon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only is the usual high degree of freedom, but every time you perform on stage, you can also participate in revenue sharing. Ticket revenue alone is a lot of money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are willing to pick up customers privately, the benefits will be even more lucrative. Even if it's just drinking tea and chatting, there are many people who are taken advantage of to pay the bill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What can tempt Isabel is the precious training resources provided by the organization behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, in addition to the nobles, there is also a special group of high-status—the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When a person's strength is strong enough, the restrictions on his birth will no longer exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world estimated that it would never have been imagined in their dreams, but the delicate Miss Isabel is actually a not weak knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this news gets out, it is estimated that her reputation can go a step further, and she may even become the number one singer in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these are not what Isabel wants. What she wants most is to be able to control her own destiny, instead of only being attached to the diva group as she is now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the weak, beauty is the original sin. \"A beautiful girl with a bad life\" is the best way to explain it. Without the protection of Rainbow Moon, she would be reduced to someone else's meat in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are lucky, you will be included in the house by a certain big shot; if you are not lucky, it will be unpredictable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The carriage was driving slowly on the street, and Isabel seemed not to hear the shouts from the outside world, and did not respond from the beginning to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrival of the Rainbow Moon singer group added a lot of chatter for the nobles in the southeastern province, but it did not affect everyone's war preparations at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His Majesty the King let go of his words: Whichever province has the worst combat readiness, let the army of that province take the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good student, Governor Pierce directly revised it, and issued an order to the counties based on what he learned and used: whichever county's combat readiness is not active, let the army of that county go first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dares to take this naked threat lightly. Except for some fanatics who ran out to watch the excitement, most of the nobles were still training the army honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, suppressed step by step. Except for Wright County, which organizes everyone's training in a unified manner, almost all counties have similar orders-whose army is not active in combat preparations, let the army of that family go to the battlefield first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't want to go, then don't join the army in the county. You don't need teammates who are holding you back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible to change jobs, and they are all rejected by the army in their own county, and the big forces outside don't collect junk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although when it comes to the battlefield, the more troops the better; but everyone would rather not have bad teammates who can only hinder their legs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a month of initial running-in, Hudson's officer corps finally performed in style. Judging from the momentum of the queue alone, it is definitely a first-class elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially most of these people are knights, and their personal combat power is not weak, which increases the gold content of the \"elite\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the chief instructor, Hudson's feelings are also quite complicated. Compared with the officers I trained before, the performance of the guys in front of me is really much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are aristocratic, under the supervision of Uncle Bear Stearns, each of them has completed all the training without compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one has tried to die, but the result is a bit miserable, and they are still lying on the hospital bed crying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After training every day, everyone will be organized to visit the unlucky ones on the hospital bed in the name of unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson is cruel, signaling to Uncle Xiong to do something wrong, it's just that the guy is too timid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he deserted during training, Bear Stearns gave him a hard look, turned around and ran away in fright, and accidentally plunged into the cesspit and broke his limbs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for why it is such a coincidence, it is definitely because of luck. After all, everyone watched him plunge into the cesspit, and it had nothing to do with Uncle Xiong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the long-term future of the wounded, Hudson felt that there was no need to die for this kind of injury that did not involve the vitals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, pastors are busy too. In training, all kinds of accidents are always inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a hundred days of injury, the unlucky guy who quit training due to the injury can only lie down on the hospital bed and cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the knight's vitality is strong, the bones have been connected, and a layer of magic potion has been applied, and it will be enough to raise it slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Protests do not exist. Every time the training is completed, Uncle Xiong will give a speech in person to motivate people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific content of the speech is too vulgar and violent, which is not conducive to harmony, so it is inconvenient to disclose. Anyway, after every speech, everyone seems to have been beaten with \"chicken blood\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the neatly arranged officer corps, Hudson gave a passionate speech: \"The one-month assault training is now over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a very few laggards, everyone has completed the basic training very well, but this is just the beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, everyone will go deep into their respective family private armies, and pass on to them what you have learned in this month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are all watching how to train soldiers. If you can't learn it, it can only prove that you are too stupid, and you are destined not to be a general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enough nonsense, the next month is the time to test your learning results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The serfs also received certain training, but the ones who trained them were also serfs. You are nobles, no matter how trash you are, you are better than a bunch of serfs, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then you can figure it out, and we will test the results in a month. What kind of soldiers are trained, what level are you yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The autumn harvest is less than two months away. After the inspection is completed, you have to take the soldiers back to complete the autumn harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military training that follows will be implemented by you yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't waste this critical month. Now that you find a problem, you can still ask for advice. It will not be so easy to learn later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Remember one sentence: If you want to make achievements on the battlefield, you have to sweat a lot!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Money, beauty and power are always the objects of pursuit of the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past half a month, under the deliberate publicity of the opera house, the news of the arrival of the Rainbow Moon has already spread throughout the southeastern province. Almost all interested nobles showed up in Beida City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As usual, she completed the formulaic performance amidst the madness of the fans. Isabel didn't feel the slightest sense of accomplishment, but felt disgusted instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, her desire for strength emerged again. Reason told her that only by becoming a strong person can she be qualified to leave here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Doesn't the target appear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A mysterious voice sounded, pulling Isabel back from her thoughts. Glancing at the shadow man who suddenly appeared, he said angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No! I don't know if there is something wrong with that guy, but he has been training soldiers in the territory all the time, and he doesn't understand the slightest style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shadow Killer, please inform me in advance when you come next time, in case someone finds out...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, I have observed before coming here, no one is watching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the diva group, everyone knows your Isabel's habits, and no one will come here to make fun of themselves at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if someone does come, I can still leave quietly. Unless someone comes from a top-notch powerhouse, they won't be able to keep me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now your task is to get rid of that mountain lord as soon as possible, and make sure whether the Blood Moon Horn is in his hands, so that we can decide whether to take the next step. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the beginning to the end, Yingsha didn't feel any disturbance in his heart, as if the beauty in front of him didn't exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blockhead!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After complaining in a low voice, Isabel said slowly: \"Don't worry, I haven't spent these days in vain, and all the information about this mountain lord is here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strange thing is that none of the nobles in the southeastern province have heard the news that the Blood Moon Horn is in the mountain area. I clicked from the side, but they denied it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little probing, they actually told me that the Horn of the Blood Moon fell into the hands of the Holy See after the last war. He also vaguely mentioned that the king's special envoy was killed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to arouse their suspicion, I have no way to continue asking. Just two very different answers, there must be a problem behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, I would like to remind you, don't think that because your stealth skills are good, you can be invincible in the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territory is not as simple as you make it out to be. Even the information I have investigated is completely two extremes with what you gave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that you are not sure whether the Blood Moon Horn is in the mountain territory. Even if it is confirmed, I don't think you can bring things out in an army of hundreds of thousands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind reminder is not that Isabel is soft-hearted. It seems to join a mysterious organization, but in fact the relationship between them is still mainly trading.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The connection is entirely based on interests, and I don't know much about the mysterious organization. From the limited information in hand, I can't directly infer who the \"owner\" behind the scenes is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, there is naturally no sense of belonging. At this moment, I reminded Yingsha, mainly because I was worried that this guy would rush over and expose her by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A diva is a diva after all. Once her hidden identity is exposed, trouble will come to her. Rainbow Moon will not stand out for a \"twenty-five boy\" diva.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hundreds of thousands of troops?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isabel, what are you kidding?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountainous region doesn't even have a population of more than a hundred thousand, so how come there are hundreds of thousands of troops?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that, like some idiot singers in your group, they are being flattered to be stupid, and they even lose their own judgment! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shadow Killer said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he doesn't have enough xinxing cultivation. As an assassin, the most important basic skill is to have a calm mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This news is really too shocking. If the Dalton family has assembled hundreds of thousands of troops, it is estimated that everyone may still believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unknown whether there are 10,000 young and strong in a mountainous territory. How to become an army of hundreds of thousands?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your intelligence is too lagging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just a mountain leader, naturally there are not so many young and strong, but with the power of other small nobles, it is hard to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, they are only secretly guessing the specific number of young adults who have received military training. The Mountain Territory has not released the data to the public, anyway, the number of people must be indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you don't take these serf soldiers to heart, besides serfs, there are also a large number of noble children who received military training together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number is still uncertain. According to these nobles, there are as many as hundreds of noble children receiving training in the mountain area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of knights came out, and behind them was an army of serfs ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Are you sure you can forcibly take away the Horn of the Blood Moon from their hands? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Isabel's explanation, Shadow Killer was numb. Originally a nightmare-level task, this wave directly rose to the hell-level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military strength of the Mountain Territory is strong, but the heads of various departments within the Holy See almost quarreled for this task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps everyone felt that it was unreliable to **** it by force. In the end, this hot potato unfortunately fell to the \"sacred hand\" of the intelligence organization, and they were going to take \"hands-on\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to carry out the mission smoothly, Pius VII even went to the ascetic camp and invited several strong ones of the ascetics to cooperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that no matter how strong the ascetic monk is, facing a huge army, he can only run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if you are doing things on the enemy's territory, once you reveal your identity, you may be attacked by the local strongmen of the Alpha Kingdom at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one chance to make a move. Regardless of success or failure, you must run away immediately after making a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, the Holy See did not hesitate to use the important dark son Isabel. Trying to use beauty tricks to help achieve the goal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the result is destined to disappoint them. The cabaret show Hudson has seen a lot in his previous life, so he doesn't have much attraction at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave the business in hand and travel hundreds of miles just to watch a dispensable performance. Hudson's brain has not yet convulsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isabel, you know men best. Is there a way to get close to that mountain viscount, or find a way to lure him out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I mean to get rid of that earth bear, find a chance to be alone with him, and wait for the opportunity...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Yingsha finished speaking, Isabel rolled her eyes: \"Things, how can you say it so simply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our publicity is so obvious, that guy can nest in the territory to train troops, obviously a person with strong willpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the past legendary stories of this mountain collar viscount, there is no scandal at all, maybe he has never tasted the fun of men and women.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't want to come out of the territory, so I can't let me go to the mountains to play sex, and teach him how to get better, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very easy for you to get close to this person. If you place a huge military purchase order, you may meet him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the situation is a bit special now, and preparations are being made everywhere. Orders from the Mountain Territory are soft, even if you place an order, they may not accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want me to say that you don't bother to bother, just send someone over to negotiate the price. The Horn of the Blood Moon has no real meaning to this person, and is not an item that cannot be transferred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this kind of ambitious man, as long as the bid is high enough, there is nothing that cannot be discussed. The prerequisite is: the Horn of the Blood Moon is really in his hands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, Isabel did not forget to throw a wink. It's a pity that Yingsha's heart has long been as still as water, and he has no interest in this smiling beauty in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will report the information you have collected truthfully! If the superior agrees, your reward will be indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reminder, don't play with fire. Beauty is a woman's most powerful weapon, but it is also the source of her disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not every noble is so disciplined. The organization has solved a lot of troubles for you, otherwise the rainbow moon alone would not be able to protect you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a few ordinary nobles' children, but if a big noble is really fascinated, it may be the beginning of disaster for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the warning, Shadow Killer disappeared into the room without leaving any trace, as if no one had ever been there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isabel, who stayed in the room, was secretly worried. Sometimes being too attractive is a sin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of noble children poured into the city to eat, drink and have fun, naturally jealousy. There were many conflicts and conflicts, and the Governor's Mansion was soon alarmed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's going on? Why don't you train your troops at home and go to Beida City to make trouble? Did the heads of these nobles get flooded?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked angrily at the sheriff.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is a critical period, and all provinces are preparing for war. Whoever stops will be beaten by the society!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He, the boss, was so anxious that his younger brother dared not take it seriously, which was simply adding fuel to the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Rainbow Moon Singers have caused trouble, since they arrived in Beda City, the city has not been peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats from all over the country frantically poured in, and most of the children of nobles who fought in the city were jealous. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guccioni said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the sheriff in the city, his life has been difficult recently. A group of aristocratic children know how to make troubles when they are full all day long and have nothing to do, which greatly increases the pressure on public security in the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Trash!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count the noble children who came to the city to eat, drink and play, and send the list to the counties, so that their families can come and lead them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, remind them that once the war in northern Xinjiang breaks out, these people must be included in the list of the first batch of officers and soldiers to participate in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Absence for any reason will be punished as desertion. Even if he died, he could not be buried until the Governor's Mansion sent someone to verify his body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let all the county guards pay attention to it. If you don't know how to restrain your subordinates, you can learn from Viscount Hudson and gather the noble children to practice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said almost roaring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more information you know, the more pressure you will be under. The increasingly tense situation on the mainland is very unfavorable to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The energies of the major powers of the human race have been restrained for various reasons. This means that after the outbreak of the war, the support that the nations of the human race can provide is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a critical juncture, Earl Pierce didn't even care about suppressing dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, there were still a group of aristocratic children who didn't want to make progress, and ran to him to compete and be jealous, completely looking for excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that the boss is not exciting. Then came a ruthless one, directly including the thrill-seeking guy into the first batch of reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you get tired of the work, you can continue to put it badly. Anyway, my life is my own, so just toss about it casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the mountainous area, Hudson, who didn't know how to be a role model, is busy every day like a hardworking bee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The typical \"007\" work system is arranged by myself, and I don't know how to talk about it if I want to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    became a role model again, and Hudson naturally didn't know it. After all, the time is too short, how can one month train qualified officers?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most people have only learned a little superficially, and they have not recognized the essence of things at all. It's okay to be a grassroots military instructor, but I want to command the army...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to discuss this issue. Hudson himself does not have the ability to command large corps to fight. Not to mention the younger brothers who studied with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a small number of famous generals with different talents, the military command ability of most generals is slowly honed in the process of leading troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, now, organizing a large number of young and strong training is a major breakthrough in the ability to lead troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were many problems during the period, they were finally resolved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this kind of experience, I am afraid that Hudson would never have dreamed that one day he would be able to command so many soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, the logistics supplies are about to bottom out. In recent days, the training intensity has been too high, and the consumption of supplies has exceeded expectations. Do you think...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Tom could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"The application for logistics supplies was signed by these noble officers, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers and horses have not moved, but the food and grass go first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Logistics is always the top priority of war, especially during expeditions, the test of logistics is even more severe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is just a simulation of the kingdom's logistics supply. As a result, there was no \"accident\" by accident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, this is an on-site training, and it is just an overrun of supplies. If it is on the march, it is estimated that more accidents will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an officer who escorted logistics supplies, Hudson is well aware of the complexity of logistics. The troubles encountered during the delivery of logistical supplies during the last time when the Skeleton Society was suppressed caused a lot of headaches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Signed! All procedures will be strictly implemented according to your regulations.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom replied in the affirmative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once upon a time, Hudson hated procedures the most. But after he assumed the position, he had to set up a set of procedures for his subordinates to execute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that I'm worried about whether human nature can stand the test, it's simply that the ability of the people under my command is limited. Without setting up a strict set of procedures for them to follow, they can mess things up in minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Flexibility\" is based on the premise that bureaucrats have certain qualities and can make some flexible judgments independently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that Hudson obviously does not have so many high-quality talents. Give them authorization to be flexible, and I am afraid that they will become completely different soon after they reach the bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Give all the material consumption bills to these officers, and you don't have to worry about the rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since there are not many logistics supplies left, then notify the troops and bring people back to the territory in advance to participate in the autumn harvest work! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whoever's soldiers consume supplies, whoever is responsible for paying the bill. Anyway, he wouldn't put a copper coin in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no venue fee for training, it is all for the sake of \"humanity\". Of course, huge military purchase orders also played a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Make money, not shabby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the way to make money must be paid attention to. Not every copper coin has to be earned in his own hands. When it's time to talk about human feelings, you must talk about human feelings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Off-the-job training, no one can afford to support so many soldiers. The standing army of the entire Alpha Kingdom is only maintained at around 300,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still due to the threat of the orc empire, otherwise the number of the kingdom's standing army would be at most a hundred thousand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is a gold-swallowing beast. The high military investment of the Alpha Kingdom is all deducted from the extravagant expenses of the nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom is also one of the few countries in the Aslant Continent that lists \"war tax\" as a regular tax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other human nations mostly collect a temporary fee when a war breaks out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with this gold-swallowing behemoth, the country still feels struggling. Not to mention the little nobles, just training for more than two months has caused many people to feel pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Participating in the autumn harvest is inevitable. Only by letting the serf soldiers work to support themselves can everyone persist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The long-distance march is also an opportunity to test the results of training. Although the journey this time is not long, it can also let the noble officers experience in advance the various troubles that may occur during the march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering too much for the younger brothers, Hudson himself was about to be moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the team leaving the camp, for some reason, Hudson felt a sense of reluctance in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past two months, although I have been busy with my feet on the ground, it is better to have a fulfilling life. It's like finding the goal of life, and being able to put all your energy into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When will I be able to have so many troops?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This idea was just born, and Hudson himself was taken aback, and hurriedly forced himself to dismiss this unrealistic idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to cut off ideas, but once ambition takes root, it's hard to get rid of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 149": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 149: marriage\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 149 Marriage\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Autumn harvest is the most important season of the year. From nobles and lords down to serfs, they all cheered up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aftermath of the locust plague did not dissipate because of the interval of one year. Many small-scale pest plagues still broke out in various places, but they were quickly extinguished by the local noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wright County is lucky. Last year, in order to quickly eliminate locusts, most noble lords hired Bear Stearns to go there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear who has received money is still very reliable in his work. Not only did the locusts die out, but the eggs in the ground were also cleaned up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No larvae hatched, just a few grasshoppers from outside, and they added a dish to everyone's table. Grain production remains at a normal level and is hardly affected by locust plagues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The money-saving lords were stunned. Last year's cost of locust control was saved, but the price was a reduction in grain production this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost or earned, only they know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's been a bumper year for the Mountain Territories. Most of the wasteland opened up last year has been planted with food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was pleasantly surprised by the output of the swamp, in particular. Although the yield of rice is slightly higher than that of rye, it is still a surprise to be able to produce three hundred pounds per mu. (1 pound is about 0.45 kilograms, which can be regarded as a catty)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Extensive agriculture, this kind of output is already very good. If it is intensively cultivated, the yield will increase significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just not necessary. Master Hudson doesn't lack land, but what he lacks is the labor force to reclaim the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mine dignitaries, land reclamation dignitaries, and building castles still need manpower. Even if the total population of the territory is approaching 90,000, Hudson still feels that it is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the proportion of orc slaves is too high, and the labor efficiency is far inferior to that of humans. The problem of racial talent cannot be easily reversed the day after tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Autumn grain has been put into storage, and the food pressure in the mountainous areas has been greatly relieved. In addition to some customers who used grain to offset the payment, they finally didn't have to pay for grain this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking stock of the accounts, Hudson was surprised to find that he had changed from a debtor to a creditor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is the result of adding the income of the Cubs last year. But it doesn't matter, the partner bear's money is Hudson's money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earth Bear is not a giant dragon, and he doesn't have the habit of sleeping with gold coins in his arms. As long as the accounts are clear and Bear Stearns can see that the money is on the account of the project, it will be fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just thinking about the upcoming war, Hudson's good mood was instantly lost. No matter how rich the family background is, it cannot withstand the squandering of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the nobles, the risk of war is not only life and death, but also poverty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risk of death in battle is a matter of probability, but everyone must face the financial deficit caused by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, the kingdom will bear most of the war expenses, but the money does not fall from the sky. In addition to the support of various countries, the main thing is to find a way by ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Merchants and free people must be the key targets of taxation, but the proportion of the population of these two groups is too small, and the pockets are not rich enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More still have to be apportioned by the noble lords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Kingdom does not only collect cash, and various strategic materials can be offset. Basically, it is based on the actual situation, what happens and what happens.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a long time, the southeastern provinces have played the role of big food and grass households. It is estimated that there will be a slight change this time, and most of the military industry in the mountainous area will be included in the mobilization system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In times of war, weapons are never enough. Not only disposable ordnance needs to be continuously replenished, but also damaged weapons and armor need to be replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to coordinate specifically is the task of the Governor's Office. Usually, the provinces coordinate first within the unit, and then coordinate and deploy nationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the existing productivity, the Alpha Kingdom's combat readiness system can develop to this stage, and the credit of the Orc Empire is definitely the greatest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the pressure of life and death, it was almost impossible to mobilize millions of troops to fight in the feudal era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the orcs weren't too brutal, they wouldn't be able to mobilize all the nobles with their families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it is due to the unfavorable fleeting years. The southern provinces that suffered severe drought last year have ushered in another round of heavy rainfall this year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The freshly harvested autumn grains have not had time to be fully put into the warehouse, and there is a continuous rainy season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountered rainwater soaking, a lot of food began to moldy, or re-rooted and sprouted, making the nobles and lords miserable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain leader is no exception. Looking at the grain that has not been dried, Hudson is also frowning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where grain can be spread, it is covered with grain. Even his lord's mansion was full of grain as far as the eye could see, leaving only a narrow road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, the fate of moldy food cannot be avoided. As a last resort, the serfs could only be ordered to fry the grain with water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Storing one more day counts as one day, it is better than immediately moldy and spoiled. Anyway, there are many mouths in the mountains, and the food consumption is fast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really can't store it, let the people, slaves, and animals open their bellies to eat together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enduring the pain, Hudson walked into the laboratory and walked out of the laboratory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, another day of failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original life liquid was not produced, but the quality of the raging feed pills is getting better and better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sugar, honey, and animal milk are naturally not added, but this does not affect Bear Stearns' subsequent processing. Put the feed pellets into animal milk with added sugar and honey, and drink it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taste and efficacy are all together. According to Bear Stearns, one feed pill can cover its normal practice for a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Uncle Xiong likes to eat, which is also a good thing, which means that Hudson's experiment has a funder paying for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one buyer, there is no hope of making money, but the balance of payments is barely achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just pity for the various animals that become experimental animals. The better the quality of the feed pellets, the faster they will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson lowered the concentration, these ordinary creatures still have no resistance under the extraordinary energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only success was to cultivate a \"Strong Bull\". As the only cow that walked out of the laboratory alive, its strength is several times stronger than that of ordinary cows, and it is a snap to plow the land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe because of genetic problems, or maybe some details were not noticed, there is only one success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to experiment with war horses, but after considering the cost, Hudson decisively chose to give up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to be disappointed about. Magical alchemy is like doing scientific research. It is a process of constant trial and error.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure is normal, success is accidental.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, you came here in such a hurry, but what happened?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Baron Redman who suddenly appeared, Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are not in the habit of rushing in the rain. Unless there are important matters, under normal circumstances, everyone will not go out during the rainy season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that nothing major has happened recently, but if I insist on it: it is a group of unlucky nobles who are jealous, and were forced into the first batch of expedition teams by Governor Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These have little to do with the Koslow family. The younger generation of children were all training in the mountains at that time, so they had no chance to join in the fun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The older generation of nobles have already matured their minds. For the sake of a few singers, she would not leave the affairs of the territory alone and go to Baida City to watch the excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The marriages of your two elder brothers have been settled. This time, the main reason for coming here is your marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was no need to be so anxious, but the pace of war is getting closer and closer, and no one knows how long this war will last.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have a big family and a big business now. Once you lead troops to go out, the stability of the rear will be a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stabilize people's hearts, you must get married as soon as possible, and try to get your wife pregnant before going out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor parents all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even nobles, once their children are involved, they are no different from ordinary parents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just two or three months, the marriage of the two elder brothers was quickly finalized and arranged for Hudson. It was obvious that Baron Redman was busy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, it was also the peak period for nobles to marry. No one knows what will happen next, every ally added will increase the probability of survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you die in battle unfortunately, it is good to leave a descendant to inherit the family business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the previous two elder brothers, Hudson has obviously more power to speak on personal life-long events.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the fact that Baron Redman came to ask for advice in person. Putting it on the two elder brothers, I am afraid that it is just a notice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Children of nobles, while enjoying the convenience brought by the power of the family, they will inevitably have to bear corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no rush to refuse. The current mountain territory really needs a mistress, and more importantly, an heir.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, the preparations are starting now, and the time is too short. Or is it that the family already has a candidate, and both parties have even communicated?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked rationally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his current status, it is not difficult to find a wife who is well-matched, but the key is politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, Hudson's marriage is no longer just a personal issue, but a common issue for the entire Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, regarding the issue of the hostess of the mountain leader, the family has already started looking for a candidate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You are not too old, so there was no need to be in such a hurry. It's just that the current situation is changing too fast. The Koslow family caught up with the war just after returning to the ranks of middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the Mountain Territory is certainly good, especially since you have attracted many allies. But it is not enough to survive this war safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the time of family inheritance is not short, it has been far away from the political center for many years, and we are behind in many aspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now you need the support of your wives, so that you can keep abreast of the high-level movements of the kingdom and integrate into the power center as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is too short, and there are not many choices left for you now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a total of five noble families who are in line with the interests of the family and intend to marry you. You choose one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We must complete the communication as soon as possible. If it is too late and others take the lead, it will be troublesome. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the parchment and looking at the records on it, Hudson was surprised to find that three of the five noble families were outside the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it carefully, it seems that this is also a normal situation. There are not many middle-class nobles, and even fewer women of the right age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such haste now, those younger candidates can only be excluded naturally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the target is limited to the province, then the choice space is too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the circle of in-laws of minor nobles is several hundred miles nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A thriving family like the Koslow family can turn all neighbors into relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they cross the ranks of middle-class nobles, the choice of marriage partners will be greatly reduced, and the scope of expansion will become inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The choice circle of the big nobles is even narrower. Apart from marriages within the kingdom, many big families have in-laws abroad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the candidate information on the parchment, in addition to the middle nobles, there are also offshoots of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Hudson's performance has caught the eyes of big shots and has a certain value in attracting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they are all collateral. If a certain nobleman is willing to offer his daughter-in-law to marry, it is estimated that the Koslow family will not have the slightest hesitation, and they will directly agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then the Holliser family!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No other reason than pure familiarity. Among the five noble ladies above, Hudson has only met Melissa of the Hollisle family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other four may be astonishingly beautiful, or they may be hideously ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It involves a lifelong problem, and Hudson dare not gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's better to make a decision in advance, so as to save other accidents after going to the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the elite of the younger generation, those who are interested in Hudson are not only the local powerful factions. The dignitaries in the capital also don't mind adding an in-law with potential stocks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is in a peaceful age, it is also a good choice to marry the nobles of the royal capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is the age of war, and the so-called power in the war is empty. Only the strength in hand is real.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are major changes and troubled times are ushered in, the fiefdom nobles with an army will definitely provide stronger help than the nobles attached to the royal power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holliser family is also a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is now in decline, his ancestor is one of the great nobles in the kingdom, and his background is one of the best among the middle-level nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, it is still the second largest family in the southeast province, and its strength is by no means comparable to that of our Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Viscount Oran can be regarded as a promising master. The Holliser family has also developed well in recent years, and there are some signs of returning to the ranks of the great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is just one thing you have to think about, once you marry the Holliser family, you will inevitably be feared by the Dalton family, and may even be suppressed. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman reminded cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, this kind of thing is destined to be unavoidable, so there is no need to worry too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory was able to go smoothly before, because the Dalton family needed us to contain the northern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the situation has changed. The nobles of the northern land who have been severely injured have been suppressed by me, and the threat of the mountain land has become prominent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't deliberately target the mountain leader, that's because the situation in the northern border is tense, the war is about to break out, and there is no room for internal friction in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the overall situation, the Dalton family should not do anything on the surface. It is estimated that Governor Pierce is probably planning to use this war to consume our strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only our family that is facing this kind of pressure. Several powerful middle-level nobles in the province will receive the Dalton family's key care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big nobles restrict the middle nobles within their own sphere of influence, purely because of their own interests. No matter who you marry, you can't change this essence. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too much debt is not burdensome. From the day when they rejected Earl Pierce's solicitation, the two sides were destined to be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is useless to compromise. Unless the strength of the Mountain Territory no longer continues to grow, sooner or later, conflicts will arise between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tense situation only delays the conflict between the two parties, but it does not mean that the conflict does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 150": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 150: meet by chance\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 150 Encounter\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's just rushing, but the number of people getting married in October 99987 in the sacred calendar is extraordinarily high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sent out hundreds of copies of congratulatory gifts. Such a dense wedding is scary to think about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson's two elder brothers, they also got married quickly in October, lest they fall behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was supposed to set aside time to prepare for Hudson's wedding, but something went wrong with the Holliser family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the two families decided to marry, they remembered that the other protagonist was still at Wangdu Academy of Magic. When the news spread, Melissa had already followed the academy's training team into the Warcraft Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the party involved, there is no way for the wedding to take place. The sudden delay made the two families very embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone was cautious enough to only release the news of the marriage, and did not announce the wedding time, or else they would lose their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As compensation, the Holliser family agreed to sell 150 copies of the life essence at 20% off the market price. The heroic generosity instantly appeased all the dissatisfaction of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One hundred and fifty copies of life essence represent one hundred and fifty chances to give birth to a knight. Calculated according to half the success rate, seventy-five knights could be born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the thriving Koslow family, this resource came too timely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is very satisfied, including Hudson himself. The age of this body is only 19 years old, and the postponement of the wedding is nothing at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marriage early can certainly calm people's hearts, but its actual effect is still very limited after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something happened to him and he left a young heir, it would be very difficult to keep the inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's going to be cheaper for others. Instead of thinking so much, it's better to strengthen your life-saving strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, Hudson has been in and out of the laboratory every day, not only to study the life essence, but also to enhance Bear Stearns' strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xiong's strength is his strength. If you really encounter trouble on the battlefield, at least you can take him away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the others, if they are really defeated, they can just ask for blessings!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of life-saving, Bear Stearns really did not disappoint Hudson. The running speed is faster than many flying eagle monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After two years of continuous efforts, the concept of \"life-saving\" has finally been imprinted in Bear Stearns' bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the biggest benefit of raising the cubs from an early age. If it is replaced with an adult Earth Bear, even if Hudson wears out his mouth, it will not have the slightest effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Habits that have been developed over hundreds or even thousands of years can be changed in just one or two years?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The breath of war has not been diluted with each wedding, but has become more intense as time goes by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rainy season did not stop everyone from preparing for the battle. With the inspection of the Kingdom Inspectorate, nobles and gentlemen walked out of the house one after another, even in the rain to organize the young and strong for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the effect, they all moved anyway. It can be seen that everyone has a strong desire to survive, lest they become a typical example of inactive training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory is no exception. The only difference is that in order to ensure the production of the mine, not all staff participated in the training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about this, no matter how exaggerated the mobilization intensity is, military production is the primary guarantee industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous basic training, this time Hudson took out even the military formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phasean formation, circular formation, conical formation...these simplest military formations were all copied out by him according to memory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for some well-known formations, it is a pity that Hudson is only a military enthusiast, not a military researcher, and he doesn't know how to operate them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the conditions of the two worlds are different. All formations that match firearms are not worth duplicating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the simplest basic army formation, which can be used in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the chaotic team, Hudson knew his choice was right. Serf soldiers can't expect too much, even in the simplest military formation, there will be soldiers who get the wrong position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After half a month of tossing, everyone learned to recognize command flags and get rid of the embarrassment of relying on shouting for communication.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the performance of the elite troops. The performance of the reserve serf soldiers is even worse, and they often don't know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, Hudson really didn't deliberately keep everyone in the training camp last time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time is too short, and it is not easy to complete the basic training. It is too embarrassing for the serfs who can't tell the difference between the southeast and the north to directly learn something as tall as the military formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is barely learned, it is only in form, but not in spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The protagonist of a war is still human after all. Regardless of any formations and tactics, they still have to be implemented by people in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the avenue to the simplicity, in many cases, simple and easy-to-learn things are the most suitable for war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drill, Drill... Besides Drill, Drill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the general army, catapults and ballistas appeared in Hudson's team. The only advantage is that it has a long range, which increases the long-range attack capability of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the lethality, it depends on whether the enemy is willing to cooperate. If a swarm of swarms rushed over, the lethality would definitely not be small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be very embarrassing if the actions were dispersed. The hit rate of catapults and ballistas has always depended on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The error is more than ten meters, which is a routine operation. It is not impossible to fly tens of meters away from the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that there are high-precision long-range attack weapons, such as the magic crystal cannon. The problem is that Hudson doesn't have that thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not just about money, it's because you can't really buy it. It is said that every magic crystal cannon is made by a master alchemist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only nobles with a deep background can have such a big killer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The real thing, Hudson has never seen it. But according to the records in the classics, this thing is clearly the artillery of the continental version of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unified standard for the size of power. Generally speaking, the larger the caliber, the greater the power, but this is not absolute, it mainly depends on the level of the magic crystal cannon maker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that is the same is the ammunition. Almost all magic crystal cannons are driven by magic spar or magic core. The strange thing is that it is a pure energy attack, but the lethality is manifested in a physical way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cannot be mass-produced, and the power, range, accuracy, and stability all depend on the alchemist's personal level. The magic crystal cannon has been specially made for rich players since its birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every attack is full of gold coins. Even if a poor man like Hudson got the magic crystal cannon, he couldn't afford it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, only when facing elite orc troops, will everyone take out big killers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like daily suppression of rebellion, no nobleman has the luxury to use magic crystal cannons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orc empire, the sudden locust plague, hurt this ancient empire very much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the agricultural technology of the orcs is very backward. For most races, not having enough to eat is the norm. After this disaster, more races have fallen into food shortage crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only agriculture is affected, but also animal husbandry. Facing the overwhelming army of locusts, the pastures also suffered a devastating blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reduction of fodder has forced many tribes to slaughter their livestock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy loss has made the voice of the main combat faction unprecedentedly loud. If there is a shortage of food, go to the human race to grab it. This has been a consensus among the orc community for countless years in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war was not launched immediately because the orc empire was too vast and needed to gather more troops from all over the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bimeng Imperial Court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of the five royal families, it is still a \"fame\" scene where the father is kind and the son is filial, and the son is desperately trying to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Alex, you will host this Southern Expedition!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emperor Beamon didn't seem to see the gloomy faces of everyone, and directly handed over the important task of the Southern Expedition to Crown Prince Alex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unexpected important task pulled Crown Prince Alex, who was paddling, out of the fishing state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is currently playing the role of a lustful dude. It is completely irresponsible to appoint him to preside over the Southern Expedition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Respectable Bimenghuang's demeanor, it doesn't seem like he is acting, as if he really wants to take over the important task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, the Southern Expedition involves too much, and I am afraid that it will be difficult for me to undertake such a heavy task with my ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prince Butzweig has served as the governor of the border for a long time and knows the affairs of the human race best. It's better for him to take charge of the Southern Expedition, and I will act as his assistant and assist him from the side. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alex immediately shirked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, there must be a demon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't know what kind of medicine was sold in Emperor Beamon's stomach, his plan had reached a critical moment, and it was absolutely impossible for him to leave the imperial court.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Prince Butzweig will assist you to complete the task. As the heir of my Beamon clan, how can I not show my brave side?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is settled like this. Alex, go down and prepare, this time the Southern Expedition will be led by you! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Meng Huang's sharp eyes, Alex shuddered involuntarily, as if all the secrets had been seen through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, reason seized the high ground in time, and Alex did not show his gaffe. But deep down in his heart, he secretly reminded himself to be careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you want to do it in advance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This idea was dismissed by Alex as soon as it was born. Compared with the highly respected Emperor Bimon, he, the new crown prince, is really unpopular in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Launching a coup for no reason, even if it succeeds, it will be difficult to gain everyone's support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it will be hindered by several other royal families. What everyone needs is a cowardly Beamon Emperor, but no one wants to see a scheming Beamon Emperor who is good at hiding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the twelfth lunar month of winter has arrived, and the date when Caesar III canonize the nobility is getting closer and closer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobility conferring ceremony only happens once every few years. If you miss it, you don't know when it will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to miss the canonization date, all the nobles who needed to accept the canonization set off early one after another. Including Hudson is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the bitter cold wind, the horse galloped all the way north. It felt like a blunt knife cutting flesh, constantly rubbing and tearing his cheeks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the nobles who were traveling together were gritting their teeth and persevering. It seems that they are competing in secret, and no one is willing to admit defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of everyone, Hudson was too embarrassed to ride in a carriage, but it was still possible to add a magic shield to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching people fight each other like children is one of Hudson's few hobbies along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, everyone's war horses are high-class mounts with the blood of monsters. Both endurance and explosive power are leveraged, otherwise they would not be able to withstand such a disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He took the lead and walked at the forefront of the team. It was not that Hudson wanted to show off, but that he was introduced by everyone as the representative of the nobles in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including a group of noble children from the north, no one raised any objections to this. This is the treatment due to the strong, and if you want to fight, you have to see if your fist is hard enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is a fight ahead, everyone be vigilant!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson warned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although I don't think anyone has lost their minds and dared to rob their team that accepted the canonization of the king, but they still need to have some precautions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the detour was too shameless in front of the younger brothers, Hudson would have gone directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a question of whether to be counseled or not, but that when you are away from home, it is better to have less than one thing that should be more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Loves to join in the fun, sooner or later he will get himself involved. For example, now, seeing two groups of people fighting each other in the distance, before Hudson could make a decision whether to intervene, a nobleman took the lead and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's the banner of Rainbow Moon, someone robbed Divas!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this news, a group of nobles who were just watching the excitement suddenly regained their spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Opportunities for heroes to save the beauty are rare, and when they finally come across, how can they be missed?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just by making eye contact, Hudson knew that the crowd could no longer hold back, and only one leader was missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no obstruction. Everyone just formed a temporary team because of the drop-in, and there is no restriction on each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delicate voices kept ringing out, and all the nobles, who had long been unable to bear it, were so angry that they could no longer care about so much, and rushed over with their guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to show his \"gregarious\" side, Hudson was no exception, but he was not in a hurry to earn performance. He just shot and killed a few soldiers to show that he was saving people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few nobles who have similar choices. Except for the guys who rushed out first because they were driven by their lower bodies and wanted to be heroes to save the beauty, the rest are just for the reputation of \"helping the poor\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that I'm afraid of trouble, it's mainly a group of singers, and it's not worth everyone's life. If the convoy that was replaced by a certain princess was besieged, everyone would probably rush up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the robbers had a tricky idea, they scattered and fled in an instant. Only the remains of the corpses left in the ground continue to tell the cruelty of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Isabel, on behalf of all the sisters of the Rainbow Moon Singers, thank you knights for your help!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jiao Didi's voice was so crisp that it was about to numb the bones of a person. Looking along the voice, it was a beautiful woman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Hudson is well-informed, he was amazed by the beauty in front of him. This is a kind of natural beauty, as if every part of the body is just right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief absence, Hudson quickly recovered. No matter how beautiful the lady is, it has nothing to do with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rainbow Moon Singer Group, not only their art performances, but also endless scandals resounded throughout the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, it is nothing more than a group of packaged high-end...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more beautiful the diva is, the more troubles will accompany it. The little nobles wanted to pounce on them, and there was no shortage of lustful people among the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reactions of the accompanying nobles, you can tell that they all look like pig brothers. If it wasn't for the presence of everyone, I'm afraid they couldn't help but rush forward and hold Isabel in their arms...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, if Hudson dares to do anything out of line, he will definitely be arranged for a romantic affair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a newly engaged man, this kind of thing must be avoided. Otherwise, if the news reached the ears of the Holliser family, it would be another disturbance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Silently looked away from Isabel, quietly watching a group of noble children step forward to pretend to be aggressive. I thought that the matter would end here, but I didn't expect trouble, but I found the door by myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Hudson, is that cute bear on your shoulder the legendary earth bear?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delicate voice sounded, and Isabel, who opened her eyes wide and revealed the appearance of a curious baby, looked extraordinarily charming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confirmed the eyes, it was directed at the bear. When did my own bear become so charming?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of the Earth Bears is indeed cute, but their powerful combat power is too popular. They have always been shown to everyone as strong, and few people care about their appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Miss Isabel, good eyesight! Yes, this is the great Mr. Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that its temper is not very good. It's better to call it Lord Bear Stearns. If you call Xiong Xiong when it is in a bad mood, it is likely to get a slap in the face! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson deliberately teased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is an agreement between Hudson and the cubs to give each other face in front of outsiders, and to talk about big things in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if frightened, Isabel closed her beautiful eyes and showed a frightened expression, which made everyone feel more pity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, he patted his chest and said, \"Thank you, Lord Hudson, for reminding me. I am afraid that only a powerful knight like you is worthy of the great Mr. Bear Stearns.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    flattery, naked flattery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson with bears is indeed very powerful, but Hudson without Warcraft is just an ordinary boy genius.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among his peers, he is outstanding, but it has nothing to do with being strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also flattered by others, but when the words are spoken from a delicate beauty, the feeling is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just don't know why, Hudson always feels that the woman in front of him is deliberately attracting his attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hudson could figure it out, Isabel quickly turned around and gave a slight salute to the nobles: \"Thank you, Lord Knights, for helping me save my sisters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little girl has nothing to repay.
