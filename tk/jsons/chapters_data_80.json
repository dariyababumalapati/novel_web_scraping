As the reserve team of the coalition forces, it is logical to fall behind the assault team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The allies have learned to paddle to preserve their strength, and Hudson doesn't know whether to be happy or worried. However, in the short term, it is beneficial.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the crowd was like headless flies, following the charge team, Hudson hurriedly suggested: \"Go towards the city lord's mansion, and there should be something to gain.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others charge for military exploits, so naturally they have to go to places where there are many enemies. It is best to find the altar so that they can make meritorious deeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Fifth Army doesn't need it. With the glory of political correctness, the income is already guaranteed, and now it's enough to just follow along!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to get more, unless you can make great achievements, it will not affect the final reward at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although credit is good, you have to live to enjoy it. For the nobles of the Fifth Army who were severely injured, it would be more affordable to rob instead of competing for the final credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was because they suffered too much from being robbed before, but now when they heard that they were going to rob, no one responded for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitated for a moment, then ruthless the head of the Cheers army, and said directly, \"Just go to the direction of the city lord's mansion, the rebels are already trapped, as long as they don't plunge into the enemy's altar, there will be no danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't believe that we have been unlucky all the time. There is such a small probability that we will be hit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, I was still too poor, so I decided to take a risk for the sake of Chances. It's just that it's okay if he doesn't talk about it, but when he talks about it, everyone becomes confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the establishment of the alliance, there has been no peace. Good things are not their turn, and bad things can be encountered every time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the two battles they experienced successively, the members who joined at the beginning were directly wiped out by half of the disaster. Those who can survive until now can be said to be hard-fated masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Hudson became uneasy. It is not a good sign that teammates always sacrifice to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opinions I put forward, when things come to an end, it is too late to regret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He stretched out his hand and touched Bear Stearns' forehead. Now he only hoped that its fighting power would be as loud as it usually is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just a cute bear appearance, which really makes it difficult for Hudson to raise his confidence, so he has to bite the bullet and add: “Slow down a little this time, and move with the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case you encounter...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to say much about harsh words, you understand everything. It's nothing more than danger, let the cannon fodder go first. This is not in line with chivalry, but it is very much in the interests of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the rebel army must have gained a lot from the two counties. Even if the wealth transfer is carried out in advance, there will definitely be a large amount of retention in Dadir City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be really embarrassing if the robbery was successful but could not be moved due to lack of manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whoosh whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the sharp arrow in Hudson's hand had already been shot, taking away the rebel leader who was blocking the way ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It should have caused a burst of confusion, but the bloodthirsty rebel soldiers turned a deaf ear to it. There was only one thought in their heads - kill!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another group of poor worms controlled by evil weapons, sighed, but the work in everyone's hands did not stop at all. They have deduced with practical actions, what is the art of killing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the expansion of killings, the black clouds in the sky are also growing, and reason tells Hudson that danger is approaching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, the cub slapped out a paw, and a flashing figure turned into a meatloaf. Two words flashed in Hudson's mind—assassin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a group of people in the continent of Aslant who specialize in assassination for a living. They are especially good at lurking and sneaking, and they are fast in action. They are called assassins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This group of guys have practiced killing skills since childhood, and everything is aimed at killing efficiently. It is said that for the best of them, every part of the body can become a murderous weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of their superb skills, they can kill people without leaving traces, so they are very suitable for black work. Many big forces have such a group of people in private.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all shady groups, and it seems nothing surprising that they are related to the Skull and Bones Society.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't appear in the front, that's because assassins are not suitable for frontal battlefields. Now enter the street fighting mode, the buildings on both sides are the assassin's natural bunkers, and the success rate of the assassination is greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky guy on the ground was obviously out of his mind, and he didn't know how to do a good investigation before the sneak attack. Playing stealth in front of the bear of the earth, isn't this provoking the dignity of the bear cub?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Good job, Bear Stearns. If anyone approached with malicious intentions, just slap them to death.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson encouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Xiong Zizi didn't appreciate it at all. Not only did he not have the idea to make persistent efforts, but he shrunk his body and returned to Hudson's shoulders to continue sleeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell him with practical actions: Shit officer, if you want Uncle Xiong to work, there is no way. The sky and the earth are big, not as big as sleeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to sleep on Hudson's shoulders, because the bear child found that in front of him, the speed of absorbing external energy is faster, which can accelerate its growth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this funny scene, Hudson smiled awkwardly. It's fine if you don't help in the battle, as long as you can protect the safety of his master at critical moments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a sharp archer, no one asked him to charge. Surrounded by sergeants, apart from assassins who are good at stealth, it is difficult for other enemies to get close.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    learn from mistakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the assassin's sneak attack on Hudson, the nobles of the Fifth Army were also taken aback. They don't have an earth bear to guard them, and they are easy to suffer big losses if they are caught off guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone unanimously became vigilant, slowed down their progress one after another, and chose to fight steadily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only in name. The truth is that the Fifth Army has already gained something, and it will take time to collect the spoils, which delays the advance speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's treasury has not yet been found, but the treasures hidden by the rebel soldiers have become the spoils of the Fifth Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of scattered things, and the value is hard to estimate for a while, but this does not affect everyone's enthusiasm for making a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, when you count the trophies later, you pretend to be naughty and sneak in to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find magic cores, magic spar, magic equipment and other items, hide them in your space and bring them back if you have a chance. I'll prepare a big pot of animal milk for you later. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson encouraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw the cub stretch out its paws, and looked at him innocently, as if saying: This bear doesn't know anything, and I can't understand what you are saying at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Another jar of honey!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    seemed to be moved, but in the end he shook his head and said in a childish voice: \"I am a principled bear, and I never do this kind of thing...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Two pots of animal milk + two pots of honey, the kind of big pots that can feed you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried to overweight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Licked his tongue, the cub tentatively stretched out his paw, and Hudson, who understood, replied decisively: \"Okay, let's pay the price you said!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the work is done, I will give you six pots of animal milk + six pots of honey as reward. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If you observe carefully, you will find that their flesh and blood are being sucked dry rapidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The terrifying scene, if it happened outside, could scare people to death, but in the eyes of the Skull and Bones believers, there was only fanaticism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the high priest who was trembling before has become energetic now, and his mind is full of how to welcome the arrival of the Skeleton Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Five sturdy young men broke away from the crowd and walked towards the altar with holy faces, preparing to welcome the arrival of the Skeleton Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only Skeleton Master who maintained a trace of rationality, at this moment secretly sighed. The high-level Warcraft could not be delivered, and now only a backup plan can be activated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five people in front of them are already masters of body forging painstakingly cultivated by the Skull and Bones Association, but they are still much weaker than the bodies of monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much power it can carry is still unknown. If the deadline is not reached, the Skull and Bones will have to run away again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about the years of wandering and hiding in XZ, the masked man is full of fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that he was young and energetic, and took over the task of undercover Skull and Bones in a flash of brain, he should have been a noble trial knight, and he might have become a high-ranking member of the Holy See now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that once he stumbled and hated through the ages, since he entered the Skull and Bones, he has started a high-level hacking mode. After several power struggles, he accidentally became the boss of the Skull and Bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Lord of Skeletons is just a false god, and he was fooled by the treasures bestowed by the Holy See. With the cooperation of his former colleagues, he gradually gained power in the meeting by borrowing a knife to kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I thought the story would end here, but the plan didn't change quickly. In the fantasy, the order of the Holy See to close the net did not come for a long time, but instead received orders to launch rebellions one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either I am rebelling every day, or I am on the way to rebellion. In particular, the high-level Holy See who arranged for him to come out as an undercover agent made his identity forgotten after his accidental death two years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See must be holy. Collaboration with cults must be carried under the banner of mysterious organizations, and cultivators are installed to become cult bosses. How can it be possible to see the light of the disaster?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the moment he put on the mask, he bid farewell to his past life. Thirty years of undercover work has even made him almost forget his own name. There is only one code name known to the outside world—Skeleton Lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that this is a way of no return, the Skeleton Lord wanted to turn back, but found that there was no way out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why are you all believers in the Lord of Dawn, and everyone else can walk under the sun and be respected by others, but you have to hide in XZ and suffer from inner torment?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the transformed skeleton on the altar, the Skeleton Lord, who had no waves in his heart, knew that he had fallen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The belief that I thought I was pious was finally shaken in the face of the cruel reality. The unwillingness in his heart turned his nostalgia for the Holy See into hatred, and he wanted revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the behemoth of the Holy See, the skeleton will be so weak that it is not worth mentioning. Even if they tried their best, they would at most mess up the two counties. This was based on the premise of the support of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disparity in strength between the two sides made the Skeleton Master suppress the idea of ​​turning against the Holy See. Glancing in the direction of the Holy See, he showed a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since you big shots want to bring chaos to all countries in the mainland, then you will simply be fulfilled. It's just that this kind of thing, how can it stay under the table?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has thrown out the iconic \"Blood Moon Horn\". As a mob, the rebels can't hold on for long, and the next thing to look at is the game between the aristocratic coalition forces and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the final outcome is, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom will keep this account on the head of the Holy See. The bad relationship between the two parties is bound to continue to deteriorate in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not extravagant to expect the two sides to turn their faces directly, as long as a nail is buried between the two. Contradictions can be suppressed once or twice, but if they accumulate ten times or eight times, they will eventually explode.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skeleton Lord knew that he should work hard. If he wanted to overthrow the rule of the Holy See and reshape the belief of the Lord of Dawn within his lifetime, he would have to cause more conflicts between the countries on the mainland and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As a devout believer of the Lord of Dawn, I can become the Skeleton Lord, so can the followers of the evil **** also become the Pope?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yes, it must be so!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expulsion of a devout believer like me is all a plot by those demons trying to overthrow the Lord of Dawn. For the Lord of Dawn, their plot must not be allowed to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Church of Dawn must be holy, and must not become a place where filth is hidden! It is absolutely not allowed for evil people to usurp power and become the middle and high level of the religion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everything is for the Lord of Dawn!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everything is for the Lord of Dawn!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under constant self-hypnosis, the original shattered belief of the Skeleton Lord has solidified again, and there are even signs of transformation into a saint.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people know that the leader of the cult is about to become a saint, I am afraid that there will be a major earthquake on the entire continent. The legitimacy of the Holy See will also be shaken accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shouts of killing are getting closer and closer, and the sacrifice is gradually coming to an end. The skeleton on the altar is undergoing final transformation, only one of the five believers has maintained his body, and the rest have been reduced to skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The host chosen by the Skeleton Master actually left a fleshy body, which made all the believers who worshiped the skeleton feel unbelievable. However, their devout belief in the evil **** still allowed them to suppress their inner doubts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, the black clouds overhead were expelled, and the sun's light scattered, directly igniting the anger of the Skull and Bones cultists.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skeleton Lord has just cast a ray of soul, and the skeleton army on the altar has not yet fully formed, and cannot face the sun at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Certain fragile bone frames have already made a puffing sound at this moment. Although they did not fall apart directly, the evolutionary transformation was interrupted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the cover of the black cloud, the location of the altar was quickly exposed. The aristocratic coalition forces that invaded the city immediately swarmed from all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is a nasty smell of holy light in the air. It seems that a priest has taken action. The sacrifice continues. Everyone and I will intercept the enemy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skeleton Lord ordered indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he made up his mind to subvert the rule of the Holy See and reshape the belief of the Lord of Dawn, the victory or defeat of Dadir City is no longer important to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"kill…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the two sides were already fighting together. Facing the continuous aristocratic coalition forces, the resistance of the Skull and Bones seemed so futile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the congregation fall one by one, the Skeleton Lord quietly left the battlefield with his cronies. This is not his war, his battle has just begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See has fallen. As a devout believer, he cannot fall down until he restores the glory of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the command of the boss, the Skull and Bones believers who fought on their own were forced to retreat by the coalition forces, and soon retreated to the altar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps sensing the approach of the enemy, the skeleton on the altar, which failed to transform, walked down first, and launched an attack regardless of whether it was the enemy or ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before a group of evil **** believers could breathe a sigh of relief, they were stabbed in the back by their own skeletons, and many of them lost their lives in a daze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Desperation spread to the audience, but the Skeleton Master who opened his eyes was very satisfied with his masterpiece, devouring the negative energy generated by everyone in one gulp, and hiccupped uncontrollably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally escaped from the dark world of the undead and saw the light of day again. The material plane is comfortable, and I enjoyed a big meal as soon as I came out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that displeased him was that this body was too weak, and he couldn't exert his full strength at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Skeleton Lord, who was enjoying a big meal, was instantly enraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are all courting death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by a roaring roar, more than a hundred skeletons on the altar instantly transformed, and each of them exuded a silver-white light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Silver Skull\"!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The knowledgeable nobleman immediately recognized it. The atmosphere on the already depressing battlefield became more and more serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The silver skull is not scary, what is scary is the skeleton master who roared just now. Especially the four pale gold skeletons in front of him, one can tell they are golden skeletons that are about to complete their transformation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Priest, blessed by the Holy Light!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mage group, attack the demons!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knights rush with me, for the glory of the kingdom, smash this bunch of bones...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that now is not the time to be indecisive. If you don't take advantage of the fact that the Skeleton Lord has just been summoned and his strength has not yet recovered, he will act first, and he will definitely pay a heavy price later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all old opponents. The Skull and Bones have been engaged in rebellion in the Alpha Kingdom for hundreds of years, and the Skeleton Master has not been called.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on past experience, Earl Pierce knew very well that if this guy could not be killed immediately, Dardir City would soon become a sea of ​​skeletons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the most annoying holy light enveloped, the already angry Skeleton Lord couldn't bear it any longer, and directly led a group of younger brothers to charge, trying to deal with the priest who shot first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just took a step forward, lightning, wind blade, fireball...all greeted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Skeleton Lord, who hadn't adapted to his body, suffered a huge loss in an instant. The hair and clothes on his body were all reduced to ashes, and even his physical body became dilapidated. The only thing that was strong was his bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was hard to get a physical body, and now it has turned into a skeleton, and the skeleton master was completely enraged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Undead Call!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by the roar, the corpse that had been lying down also stirred up, as if it was about to come back to life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not good, he wants to turn all the dead into undead, priest Debang stop it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Earl Pierce finished speaking, the priests in the coalition army had already made their move. Dozens of priests teamed up to release the Great Purification Technique, covering the audience directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the influence of the purification technique, the weaker skeleton soldiers fell apart on the spot. Powerful skeleton soldiers, their strength has also been suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Templar Knights, who had been prepared for a long time, took out the holy water they had prepared in advance, and greeted the skeleton soldiers directly. As if a chemical reaction had occurred, the skeleton soldiers who were hit spontaneously ignited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, the nearby coalition soldiers naturally would not let go of the opportunity to make trouble, and launched the strongest attack on the skeleton soldiers one after another. In an instant, more than ten silver skeletons were reduced to bone scum.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fire of souls without the protection of a bone frame ran around, trying to escape the area shrouded in holy light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the skeleton master of the big boss, he enjoyed the holy water bath as a matter of course. Halfway through the undead summoning, it was forced to stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he didn't spontaneously ignite, the sound of bones cracking from his body was enough to prove that the Skeleton Lord was not in a good state at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not caring so much, the Skeleton Lord who was plotted against immediately grabbed a soul fire and stuffed it into his mouth, trying to make up for his own damage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the idea is beautiful, but the reality is cruel. No matter how fast the soul fire healed his wounds, it couldn't be faster than the attack of the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless flying spears descended from the sky, enveloping the Skeleton Lord. These weapons all have common characteristics. They are all blessed by the holy light, and soaked in holy water all the year round, which has a strong restraint against undead creatures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It was played by someone!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reaction of the coalition forces just now was all for him to see, in order to create an opportunity to severely injure him. Unfortunately, he was unfortunately recruited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, the Skeleton Lord immediately thought of quitting. It's a pity that if he wants to leave, it depends on whether the coalition forces agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made the skeletons rebel and always rush to the street. He, a veteran evil god, has been summoned many times, and his weaknesses have long been known.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Skeleton Lord himself doesn't know about these problems. After all, every time a separate soul descends, there will be no return, and the main body will never receive the message at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It stands to reason that if there are too many failures, a lesson should always be learned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the greed in his heart made him unable to resist the temptation of the sacrifice. Being summoned by people again and again, and eliminated by people again and again, it can be called the most tragic existence in the world of evil gods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking advantage of your illness, I will kill you. To throw stones at the evil **** will not damage the honor of the nobility. On the contrary, killing the evil **** is still the highest honor in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they are civilians, as long as they kill the evil god, they can still be canonized as nobles. It is simply the best choice for **** to counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Skeleton Lord in front of him is not his real self, the glory of killing the evil god's soul is also worth fighting for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the swarming knights, the Skeleton Lord lost his temper instantly. Regardless of the image of the evil god, he just ran away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that even if he wanted to fight, he had to stay away from the annoying priests and magicians. Otherwise, it would be too much to bully the evil **** if they were besieged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bosses all ran away, and the remaining skeletons naturally couldn't stop the pace of the coalition forces. Even if the four golden skeletons were baptized by the holy light + holy water, it would be too empty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle has entered the chasing and fleeing mode, and the tragic Skeleton Lord just escaped, and suffered another round of holy water baptism.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's as if holy water doesn't cost money, you can pour it on him as much as you want. This makes the thinking mode stay in the skeleton master hundreds of years ago, which is very uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his memory, the holy water in the material plane is very rare, and it is very economical to use it. It would be nice to be able to take out a few cups, which is not like pouring pots and pots now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one will explain to him the gap between the times. What greeted him was the cold knight spear, and the magic attack that might come at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My heart is towards the light, why can't I...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Skeleton Master finished speaking, the overwhelming attack came again. Apparently, the coalition forces were not interested in hearing his story.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The evil gods are evil gods, and there is only one fate waiting for them in the continent of Aslant, and that is to be purified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ants kill elephants more often. Under the shroud of holy light, facing the coalition's crowd tactics, the evil **** can't stand it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, \"呵呵...\" the sound kept on, and the bones continued to shatter, making the Skeleton Lord understand his situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You all wait for me. When the deity comes, I will make your souls into sky lanterns and burn them under the flames for 10,000 years!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The great curse, the stare of the skeleton!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the last spell was cast, the Skeleton Lord, who couldn't hold on, crashed to the ground, leaving only bone fragments scattered on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers and soldiers of the coalition forces who participated in the war felt uncomfortable, as if someone was watching or being marked by someone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the doubts in everyone's minds, Pastor Debon stepped out to appease and said: \"Don't worry, what the evil **** releases in the end is only a marked magic, and it will not cause direct harm to your body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the Skeleton Lord comes again one day, this magic is equivalent to non-existence. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to say, but it's not that simple. This is indeed just a marking magic, but it is also a magic that pulls hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only will you be hunted down by the Skeleton Lord, but as long as you encounter a skeleton, you will instantly fill up the hatred, the kind that will never die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Facing a group of soldiers who are not afraid of death, everyone's scalp is numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told Hudson that the best way now is not to attack, but to wait for the enemy's courage to run out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the reality cannot be controlled by anyone. The Fifth Army may not attack the rebels, but the rebels cannot hold back and want to attack them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking around, they were all unlucky people hypnotized by the \"Blood Moon Horn\". Hudson, holding a bow and arrow, just couldn't find a target worthy of his arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is anything good to kill for a soldier, the Hudson Knight also has something to pursue. They all did it themselves, at least to kill the opponent's little boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archery is also a physical activity, and those who are not physically strong cannot be archers. Most of the time, archers consist of the strongest soldiers in an army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holding up the bow and arrow is an archer, and putting down the bow and arrow is also the most elite soldier. If you don't have enough physical strength, you can't be a good archer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Each arrow shot consumes a lot of physical strength. There are too many rebel soldiers in the city. They have to shoot and kill anyone they see, and they must die of exhaustion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson can only learn to be picky eaters. Except for occasionally waving an arrow to rescue his own people, he only attacked the rebel leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, a white-haired old man holding a horn in front of him and playing tremblingly entered Hudson's sight. Without the slightest hesitation, it was settled with one arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weird sound of the horn stopped instantly, and the rebel soldiers who were charging frantically suddenly became sluggish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blood Moon Horn\", as soon as the term came to mind, Hudson called it unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many coalition forces entering Dadir City, but he was caught up by him, which is luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Hudson was hesitating whether to run away, a bear shadow had already rushed out. This is animal milk + honey that was agreed before, how could Xiong Xiong miss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the hot potato was in his hands, Hudson felt a strong evil spirit and kept encouraging him to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, the mysterious compass in my mind moved, and the strong evil spirit disappeared immediately. The originally turbulent blood moon horn fell silent instantly, just like an ordinary charging horn. Apart from the appearance of being damaged, there is no feature at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It was destroyed so quickly, is it really an evil weapon?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wouldn't it be a fake and inferior product made by the Skull Society? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help but issued a soul torture.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel soldier, who looked like a walking dead, obviously couldn't answer the doubts in his heart. With puzzled questions, Hudson left the scene in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Reason told him that he couldn't stay here, otherwise trouble would come to him soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who has passed the political test, is very clear that now both the Kingdom and the Holy See are looking for the \"Blood Moon Horn\". If the status is higher and the strength is stronger, he will not hesitate to hand it over to the kingdom in exchange for benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But not now, with Hudson's current status, even if he took out the \"Blood Moon Horn\", he would not be able to get matching benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Kingdom is willing to give it, he dare not take it. If the virtue is not matched, one may not necessarily encounter disasters, but if the strength is not matched, one will definitely die miserably.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need for a competitor to take action, and the Holy See, who is so angry, will let him disappear from the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment Hudson left, Karlis, who was ordered to capture the \"Blood Moon Horn\", suddenly changed his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of continuing to sit on the mountain and watch the tiger fight, he hastily ordered: \"The breath of the blood moon horn has disappeared, and everyone rushed to Dadir City immediately.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance of more than ten miles is reached in an instant for Feilong. According to the guidance of the breath, they immediately found the place where the \"Blood Moon Horn\" last appeared, but all they were left with was corpses all over the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A white mouse jumped down from Carliss' arms, lingered for a while, and landed on the \"white-haired old man\" killed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knight who is good at scouting went up to check and replied: \"Lord Carliss, this man is not aging normally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the breath, it should be that some kind of evil weapon absorbed the whole body's essence, thus exacerbating the aging of the body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the scene, he was killed without any action. It is very likely that he was killed by a sneak attack while using the blood moon horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The arrows that killed were very ordinary, without any markings on them, so they should be ordinary equipment of the noble coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The breath of the blood moon horn should have disappeared after this person was killed. Unless we can obtain the full cooperation of the nobles of the southeastern province, it will be difficult for us to identify the murderer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were signs of vandalism at the scene, the corpse was also moved, and all the belongings of the deceased were lost. It is suspected that the coalition forces of nobles were cleaning the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also possible that after the enemy took away the blood moon horn, in order to destroy the traces of their own existence, the chaotic scene was deliberately left behind. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to this unspoken analysis, Karliss knew that this mission was in serious trouble. Counting on the cooperation of the nobles in the southeastern provinces is simply a dream.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ever since the Skull and Bones harassed the southeastern province, the two sides have been on opposite sides. Knowing that the Holy See is manipulating all this behind the scenes, and not directly turning against them, it is considered taking care of the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the Alpha Kingdom has also been involved, and the two sides are fighting over the Horn of the Blood Moon. At this juncture, whoever dares to cooperate with the actions of the Holy See is a traitor to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Although the Blood Moon Horn is not the top evil weapon, it can still be ranked first in the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to completely cover up the breath of the Blood Moon Horn, you must either have a strong person in the sanctuary or have a treasure that can cover up the breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong man in the sanctuary has already become a legend. Even if there is such an existence in the Alpha Kingdom, there is no need to expose it for a blood moon horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is rare to conceal one's breath, it is not impossible to collect one or two pieces with the background of some great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the nobles in the southeastern province, the Dalton family was able to hide the Blood Moon Horn privately. Let the insider stare at Earl Pierce to see if there is any change in him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no problem, then find an opportunity to rob and kill the Kingdom envoy in the middle. No matter how much we pay, we cannot allow the Horn of the Blood Moon to be brought to the capital. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kallis said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The world of the strong never needs evidence, as long as there are motives and suspicions are enough. When it comes to the layout of the Holy See on the mainland, there must be no flaws left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I would rather kill three thousand by mistake than let one go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it turned against the Alpha Kingdom because of this, it would be better than exposing the shocking scandal of the Holy See supporting the cult organization to the sun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The king's special envoy promised a great reward. During the robbery, everyone was paying attention to the trophies such as horns to see if they could encounter the legendary \"Blood Moon Horn\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The detection standard is very simple, to see if there are magic fluctuations. As a well-known evil weapon in the continent of Aslant, it doesn't pay attention to restraint, and you can feel the magic power fluctuations tens of meters away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the dragon cavalry landing in the street next door, Hudson pretended to be dignified and suggested: \"Uncle Chells, the place where the people from the Holy See landed is the place we just passed, and it is very likely that they are searching for the blood moon horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king's special envoy is also looking for that thing. The matter is too involved, and we small bodies can't handle it. Let's notify the earl as soon as possible! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Involving allies, Hudson was also very helpless. But there is no way, who let this unlucky thing hit them?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the quick reaction of the bear boy, who snatched the blood moon horn back in time, and let the mysterious compass in Hudson's body seal his breath, the Fifth Army would probably be bleeding like a river by now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long he can hide it, Hudson has no idea. Sealing the Blood Moon Horn does not mean that everything will be fine, and no one can guarantee that it will not be sensed at close range.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even after hiding the Blood Moon Horn outside, Hudson was still worried about getting burned. After all, the reputation of the Holy See is involved, and killing people to silence them is the most routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Alpha Kingdom pursues the responsibility afterwards and keeps all these plague gods behind, it will not be able to bring the dead back to life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nodding slightly, Cheers took out a magic flare and shot it directly into the air. A huge firework was formed in the air and lasted for two or three minutes before dissipating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the contact method agreed in advance. If there is a major discovery, a signal will be sent out, and the nearby coalition soldiers who receive the information will immediately rush over for reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the rebel altar was discovered by coalition soldiers, a signal flare appeared in the sky once. It's just that the nobles of the Fifth Army, who were devoted to paddling, chose to pretend not to see it tacitly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the situation is reversed, it is their turn to send a signal for help. It is also unknown how many reinforcements will arrive in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only good thing is that the blood moon horn has not been exposed yet. People in the Holy See have no idea that it was hidden by Hudson, and it is not time to kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facts have proved that Hudson is simply thinking too much. Seeing the signal flare that was launched into the air, the reinforcements of the coalition forces had not yet arrived, but Karlis gave the order decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's impossible not to go. They appear in the city at this time. Once they are blocked by the coalition forces, they will not be able to explain at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the flying dragon cavalry leave, the Fifth Army heaved a sigh of relief. Hating the Holy See does not mean that everyone wants to have a PK with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no evidence that the Holy See supports the cult, and the \"Blood Moon Horn\" matter, the Alpha Kingdom will indeed suffer a dull loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the small nobles, survival is always the first priority. For the Kingdom, it has indeed suffered a lot, but the nobles present are the beneficiaries, and grass has grown on the graves of the real sufferers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The people in the Holy See have already left, have they also taken the Blood Moon Horn away?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An indifferent voice rang in his ears, pulling Hudson back to reality. The person who came was the king's special envoy, Earl Frodo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that at this moment his face is gloomy and terrifying, without the intimacy of the military meeting that day, as if everyone owed him gold coins and didn't pay back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the flying dragon cavalry of the Holy See left here from the southeast after a brief stay here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether the Blood Moon Horn fell into the hands of the Holy See or is still in the hands of the rebels, it is not yet certain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, before they arrived, we searched several nearby streets, and found no trace of the Blood Moon Horn. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cheers Knight replied seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scanning the crowd at the scene, Earl Frodo, who found nothing unusual, sighed helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he didn't think that the Fifth Army, which had killed the cavalry of the Holy See, would lie about this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not seize the Blood Moon Horn from the rebels in the first place, Frodo had given up hope for this, and began to think about the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the special envoy sent by the king, in addition to the \"Blood Moon Horn\", it also includes dealing with post-war affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is rich in land and densely populated, and it is one of the richest provinces in the kingdom. Naturally, this kind of good place cannot be monopolized by a noble family, otherwise it will easily lead to a situation where the tail is too big to lose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the earls of the king's twelve fiefdoms, the Dalton family's strength is already very large, and what was revealed in this war was only the strength on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The true war potential is far from being as simple as it appears on the surface. Including a large number of nobles who participated in the war, except for a few with shallow backgrounds who came out in full force, most of them left spare energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it's not that they don't want to fight for the fief with all their strength. The main reason is that the children who are working outside are scattered all over the world, and they can't be called together for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The corruption of White and Leighton counties directly led to the breaking of the original political order. As the nobles in the southeastern province who put down the rebellion, they obviously wanted to take the biggest cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unlucky aristocrats in the former two counties, except for a few families with profound backgrounds who were able to keep their territories, the rest of the metropolises were expelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by strength. Even if there is a direct bloodline heir, without enough strength, it will be difficult to hold on to one's own territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, according to the rules of the game among the nobles, everyone will not do things so badly when they come up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the heirs know how to be human, they can continue to support one or two generations by relying on the connections accumulated by their parents. Theoretically, during this period, they still have the hope of turning around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once you become a prodigal son, or if you are unlucky and die on the battlefield, or your children are not talented in cultivation and can't even become a knight, then you can only be completely cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, where the class is severely solidified, large-scale territorial mergers, or the decline of large families, often last for several generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the concentration of territories in the southeastern provinces is becoming more and more, and the effect of the strong always being strong is an inevitable result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to these local snakes, some big nobles in the capital also want to get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eldest son inherited the family business, and the second son had to arrange a good place to live. Being able to take the opportunity to expand externally, no one is willing to split up their original territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thousands of interests and entanglements are intertwined together, just like a mess of hemp, which is constantly being cut, and the reason is still chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to balance the political structure of the southeastern province after the war while satisfying the interests of all parties as much as possible is the problem that Earl Frodo urgently needs to solve now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The two counties of Leighton and White no longer had the power to stop the coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Earl Pierce's order, the battle to regain the lost ground also unfolded in an orderly manner, and the situation can be described as good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war is coming to an end, and the topic of spoils has gradually become the mainstream. Ordinary loot is easy to deal with, and the territory is divided directly by region. How much you gain depends on luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when it comes to \"territory\", the situation becomes complicated. Unlike the wild lands on the borders of the kingdom, the southeastern province is a first-class fertile land, and no one is willing to give it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are too many monks and too little porridge, some people are bound to miss out. The game involved behind this is not only about military achievements, but also a competition of family power and network of contacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who survived the Fifth Army are all lucky ones. When it comes to \"political correctness against the Holy See\", no one dares to skimp on their military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The discussion on their merits was completed the fastest. Although the result was not announced, the worst of each family can get a knight collar, and there are not a few who are promoted to baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first minister who killed the most cavalry of the Holy See, plus other accumulated credits, Hudson was naturally listed as the first echelon of heroes, second only to killing the clone of the evil god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know the final result. Anyway, according to the information I have heard, it is a high probability event that the baron will be sealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This result was even better than Hudson expected. Originally thinking that his military achievements were not enough, he relied on his connections to find a way to inherit the fiefdom of a hapless extinct relative, but his strength did not allow him to take shortcuts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The country that you conquered by yourself is naturally better. There are no messy inheritance disputes, 100% legality is guaranteed, and you have more confidence when you go out to socialize.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the dust settled, Hudson's request for help reached Baron Redman. It's just that instead of asking him for reinforcements now, he is asking him, as a father, to mobilize family connections and help develop a wealthy fiefdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After repeatedly interrogating the soldier who delivered the letter and confirming that the information was accurate, Baron Redman still couldn't believe it was true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he thinks Hudson has military talent, this military talent is too outstanding. Others don't know what Koslow's family private army is, how can he not know?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Hudson lead the troops to the expedition, mainly to preserve the strength of the family and exercise his son's military command ability by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that the cards that started off badly would end up playing the effect of Wang Zhan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps seeing that Baron Redman was too engrossed, and used the wrong knife and fork while eating, the Baroness, who sensed something was wrong, asked expectantly: \"Master, but there was an accident on the front line?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in her heart, she had already started praying for Hudson to meet the Lord of Dawn. There is no way, as the mother of the child, she only measures so little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Her eldest son was ruined by Hudson. Under the eyes of Baron Redman, she didn't have the guts to take revenge according to Lesur's plan. She could only secretly pray that Hudson would go to see the Lord of Dawn as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"fine!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No, this should be considered a good thing, and it is also a great happy event for the entire Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to go out for a trip, and it is estimated that there will be some delays. You should take more care of your family affairs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Baron Redman still kept an eye out. He knew that his wife and Hudson were at odds with each other because of Lesul's matter, so they didn't directly say what it was.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified nobleman, he knows that nothing should be taken lightly until the dust settles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson's exploits cannot escape, the specific location of the territory has not yet been determined!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a baronie, which is also divided into three, six, and nine ranks. The better the location of the territory and the more fertile the land, the higher the income in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher the financial income of the territory, the more money can be invested in the military, and the stronger the military strength will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strong military strength is not only the guarantee of family security, but also the foundation for further progress in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has existed for thousands of years, and the accumulated background is not much, but relying on super fertility, the accumulated population is quite a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other families took a step forward and could not withstand the pressure of all parties, but the Koslow family was different. The family that gathers by calling friends and friends can have the strength comparable to that of a middle-class noble family, enough to survive the initial period of weakness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if the family's luck has been consumed in childbearing. The Koslow family's children have been average for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention leading the family further, even if any branch can add a knight collar, it is worth celebrating by the whole family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the lack of outstanding talents, the Koslow family, which had completed primitive accumulation and could not get further tickets, would have long been among the middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's amazing record brought confidence to Baron Redman. Even a fledgling is so powerful, if he settles down for ten or twenty years, wouldn't he be able to become a famous general in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continent of Aslant has never been short of wars. At Hudson's current age, even if he waits for a long time, he can wait for a big battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accumulating enough military exploits on the battlefield, obtaining a larger territory, coupled with the support of various lines, it is entirely possible for the Koslow family to rank among the middle-class nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What a father expects of his son is beyond comprehension. Under the painful eyes of the Baroness, Baron Redman opened the treasury, took out the family accumulation, and took the first step of gift giving.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who didn't know that his father had paid the capital, was returning the serf soldiers to various families with a helpless expression. Originally, he wanted to spend money to buy these soldiers, but unfortunately, everyone is not stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are serf soldiers, after a series of battles, they have already been reborn. From the initial pure cannon fodder, he transformed into a veteran.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the nobles whose family's private army has been seriously injured, these serf soldiers are also a great supplement to the family's force. Some nobles who were really short of people even directly added these veterans to the guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even some family members of the nobles who died in the battle came to sell miserably and dignify people, causing Hudson's troops to shrink sharply, four thousand, three thousand, two thousand, one thousand, eight hundred...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few extinct nobles, there were no bitter masters who came to visit the dignitaries, and all the remaining serf soldiers returned to their original owners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, I thought I was taking advantage of it, but I didn't expect to toss it to the end, but I was helping others to train soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder everyone didn't mention the return of serf soldiers before, purely because of his reputation and wanted him to help train soldiers for free.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No, it's still impossible. If you want to hang out in the noble circle, you must abide by the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only have to pay back, but also must be clean and tidy. People are doomed not to stay, but favors must stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smiling and sending away every noble who felt at home, Hudson was bleeding in his heart when he saw the remaining 600 serf soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the two counties of Wright and Badton have been destroyed. The population does not say that there is no one in ten, but it is true that there is no one in ten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of where his territory is, he will face the embarrassment of labor shortage for a long time to come. There are no people, and the expansion of armaments is a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have no choice, you can only choose to cheat. My father's territory is more than 10,000 people, and it is not bad for these few hundred young men, so it is estimated that it will not be a big problem to temporarily borrow for ten or twenty years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the mountain of supplies, Hudson directly counted the harvest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most valuable thing must be the hidden Blood Moon Horn, but unfortunately Hudson doesn't want to be on the Holy See's hunting blacklist, so he is destined to be unable to cash it out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two boxes of gold coins, 16 boxes of silver coins, and 33 boxes of copper coins. It is estimated that the total value of the coins should not be less than four thousand gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ten carts of cloth, two carts of tea, five carts of salt, one cart of spices, 200,000 pounds of grain, two boxes of jewelry, 185 horses, 78 cattle, 430 sheep...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Twenty-three war horses, ninety-three pairs of armor, two hundred and twelve broadswords, one hundred and thirty-six giant axes, forty-three bows and arrows, twenty-six hammers...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sixteen first-order magic cores, five second-level magic cores, one third-level magic core, ninety-six magic crystals, one magic wand, three sets of damaged magic equipment...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sum of all the gains, the value of these materials is no less than 10,000 gold coins. The charm of war wealth is so great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is not a day or two that everyone is greedy for the fertile soil of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the position of the king, it is most beneficial to allow these great forces to check and balance each other and maintain the balance of domestic political power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original political structure of the southeastern province was broken. If there is no external force to intervene, most of the territory of Leighton and White counties will fall into the hands of the Dalton family sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Earl Pierce has generously stated that he is willing to distribute most of the spoils to small and medium nobles, the annexation of territories has never been a matter of overnight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you extend the time, you will find that many small and medium nobles will lose their fiefdoms in the next few decades due to various reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only after the initial period of weakness and the accumulation of foundations of several generations can one truly gain a firm foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the great nobles are different. The meat eaten can be digested directly. It seems that every time you eat is not too much, but after a long period of time, it is a big number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you pay attention to eating, and don't deliberately seek territorial annexation, under the effect of the strong being strong, the territory controlled by the big nobles will continue to grow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the major forces in the country wanted to go to the southeastern provinces to get a share of the pie, out of the need for checks and balances, they naturally chose to go along with the flow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the specific executor, Earl Frodo is not only representing the king at this moment, but also representing the major forces in the kingdom who want to get involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rubbing his forehead, Earl Pierce said righteously: \"The honor of nobles cannot be desecrated. Fairness is the foundation of a kingdom. We must give priority to protecting the interests of those who have put down this rebellion!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out. Instead of distributing the territory to these powerful dragons, Earl Pierce would rather leave it to his younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the nobles in the southeastern province are not very peaceful, they are still much cuter than these greedy predators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lesser of two evils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how ambitious the little brothers are, they can't stand up to their own strength. The territory is only temporarily stored in their hands, and sooner or later they will return to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These river-crossing dragons are different. They are all top predators, and they rarely spit out after eating. Once it is put in, there will be a bunch of competitors grabbing food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course the interests of heroes must be protected, but we also have to consider the goodwill released by all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, the Alpha Kingdom is a whole. We cannot limit our vision to the southeast province, we must consider the problem from a global perspective. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Frodo hinted directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Earl Pierce is not interested in this kind of olive branch, and even rejects it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the major forces in the Alpha Kingdom were playing their own game, and there were very few behaviors that crossed the border. But with the succession of Caesar III, the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king deliberately allowed the major forces to reach out. At the beginning, everyone was able to resist the temptation and abide by the rules of the game. They just played on their own one-acre three-point land. Soon, some people couldn't control their greed and took the first step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Someone took the lead in eating meat, and the latecomers soon emerged in endlessly. It's just that the expected big mergers and big developments didn't happen. Instead, because of reaching out to each other, interests were intertwined and dragged each other down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the political means of leveraging strength, the several big nobles who showed signs of being too big were all beaten one by one by Caesar III, and their arrogance no longer existed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A new political balance system was established, and the declining royal power was miraculously reborn in the hands of Caesar III.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the great loss of royal power and the loss of a lot of territory in the last continental war, Caesar III would have a high probability of becoming a hero of the generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encountered such a boss, Earl Pierce knew he couldn't play, so he always behaved peacefully. No matter how big the bait was, he remained restrained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that he restrained, but his colleagues did not. After all, as a wealthy and wealthy landlord in the southeast province, he couldn't go out and **** some worthless land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But other big nobles can't do it, especially the guys in the north. The land itself is barren, and they are harassed by orcs every now and then, which greatly affects production.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to resist the invasion of orcs, all of them resorted to militarism, and the financial deficit was severe, all supported by the kingdom's subsidies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, although there have been no major wars in the northern border, there has never been a small war. If you want to accumulate military merits, it is a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the military exploits in northern Xinjiang are easy to get, but the fiefdom is not easy to defend! Fortunately, after working hard for a year, the orcs came when the harvest season came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All major nobles have children who are gilded in northern Xinjiang, and many of them are enshrined with military exploits, but the fiefdoms in northern Xinjiang are pushed as soon as they can, waiting for other places to get out of the hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that he couldn't evade it, Earl Pierce said cruelly: “The southeastern province is part of the kingdom, and it is indeed necessary to consider the overall situation, but the demands of the local nobles cannot be ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the kingdom lacks too many heroes who have fiefdoms, we can give up some territories, but out of the need to appease everyone's emotions, this time the entrustment should be limited to the baronies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the governor of the southeastern province, I am willing to lead by example, carry forward the noble spirit of humility, and give up the reward for this battle. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing \"lead by example\", Frodo cursed shamelessly. Those who didn't know thought that he had made great military exploits. In fact, as the governor of the southeastern province, it was his duty to put down the rebellion under his rule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the responsibility for the fall of the previous two counties was not pursued, it would be a shame. It was originally a crime and meritorious deed, and it was ridiculous to talk about giving up military merits at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Earl Pierce gave up the reward, but in fact the Dalton family has gained a lot. The children who were gilded outside did not announce that they would give up the opportunity to obtain the fief this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family, as local vipers, had no losses, but the powerful dragons who wanted to intervene in the southeastern province were forced into an embarrassing situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the small and medium nobles, the barony is indeed a big temptation, but for the big nobles, it is purely tasteless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nails can be inserted, but the potential is limited. No matter how good the development is, the upper limit is still there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the family increases investment and merges regardless of appearance, it will lose prestige and cause everyone's resistance if you are not careful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to refute, but seeing Earl Pierce's unquestionable expression, knowing that this was the bottom line of the Dalton family, Earl Frodo, who didn't want to offend anyone to death, nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I will truthfully report the suggestion of the governor to the capital, and the final result will wait for the ruling of His Majesty the king!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After clearing the rebels in the area he was in charge of, Hudson also followed the crowd and joined the event.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the favors sold earlier began to play a role. They all hang out in the aristocratic circle, which one doesn't matter at all?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Followed by the door, Hudson got a familiar face in front of most of the powerful nobles in the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The King of Hades is not easy to mess with, and so is the imp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly occupying a high position is the most likely to cause envy. I don't dare to hope that I can get the help of these people in one visit, at least reducing the probability of being put on small shoes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the family network is not in the hands of Hudson, and when they go out to socialize, they can only represent themselves, not the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, Baron Redman can only represent the branch of the Koslow family. If you want to represent the entire family, you must hold a clan meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who let the lineage of the patriarch unfortunately cut off the lineage in the orc invasion hundreds of years ago, and didn't have time to designate an heir?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The blood relationship is too far apart, and it is really hard to figure out who should inherit the position of patriarch. All the branches want to compete for the orthodox position and refuse to give in to each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the ancestral land, which was also lost. At that time, it was in a time of war, and the various branches that were in dispute simply made an agreement, and they would discuss it after the ancestral land was taken back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, until the end of the war, the ancestral land of the Koslow family could not be recovered, and the position of the patriarch was also vacant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blessings and misfortunes, the Koslow family without a patriarch, although each branch fell into a state of silos, it also avoided being feared by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Distance creates beauty. After the children of each branch have developed independently, there is no conflict of interest, and it is rare to see each other for several years, and the relationship between everyone has improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prospered by relying on the number of people, spreading branches and leaves everywhere, and even developed outside the kingdom. In the circle of the kingdom's nobles, he gradually gained a considerable reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Noble family never lacks bad things, and the situation of the Koslow family is considered good. The ancestors made a good start and left everyone with the best solution to deal with internal conflicts - points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The later ancestor of Frederick went a step further and directly set the rule: the eldest son inherits the family business, and the second son leaves his hometown when he becomes an adult and establishes a new family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the effect was good, all branches followed suit. Since then, there have been few major internal disputes in the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the children are unworthy, the tossing is at most at the level of Laisul. Those with a little bit of brain don't know how to do things at home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Successful experience, it is not that no nobles want to emulate. It's a pity that the premise of success is to have enough sons, and the population is not prosperous enough to play like this, and it is easy to have extinct heirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are not many other things in the continent of Aslante, but there are many wars. The lives of nobles who have not experienced ten or eight wars are incomplete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The busiest ones are not the nobles like Hudson who have clear military achievements and only need to implement the fiefdom. What was really lively was the gang who lacked combat achievements but were able to be related to the extinct nobles of Wright and Wyton counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Around the dispute over the right of inheritance, that is the real show of their own talents. Not only the nobles in the southeastern province, but even some nobles outside the province joined the battle circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting for ancestors, contacts, and military exploits, some of them rushed to the doctor, and gifts were sent to Hudson in order to just gain the support of public opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make up for the huge cost of gift-giving, those who come to these door-to-door windfalls are welcome, but the support is limited to not making trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. Although these guys are casting a wide net, the things they send out are too shabby, even more stingy than Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that in order to get a good fief, Hudson has scattered gifts worth thousands of gold coins, and even the Governor's Mansion has prepared generous gifts to visit once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Earl Pierce has a high threshold. Although he met face to face, he was received with dozens of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he, a valiant little knight, still failed to make the big shots treat him differently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to take time out of the daily schedule to receive reception is because the earl needs to be approachable recently. At another time point, at most a member of the Dalton family came out to receive them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can walk have been walked once, and the rest are out of reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the special envoy of the king, Hudson failed to find the way, but just sent the gift over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Experience told him that giving gifts may not be noticed by big shots, but there is a high probability that people who don't give gifts will be remembered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory has been unable to settle down for a long time, and Hudson is also idle. I either go to a banquet all day, or I am on the way to a banquet, and occasionally I have to hold one myself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The communication between nobles is so simple and unpretentious. It's a pity that they are all a group of big men, and there are no seductive noble ladies, which makes the banquet dull.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At midnight, Hudson, who had finished a day of entertainment, had just returned to his residence when he saw the cub enjoying his collection of World of Warcraft jerky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you've done a good job! I didn't expect you to be favored by the Earth Bear because you have such a relationship with monsters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman's words instantly extinguished Hudson's rising anger. Originally, he thought that some daring guard who dared to curry favor with the cubs with his monster jerky was preparing to make an example of others, but now he didn't need it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the team members were brought from their hometown, so how could they not know Baron Redman? Compared with the commander Hudson, this one in front of them is their real master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, are you here so soon?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he knew that Baron Redman would come over to act for him, he was still a little moved by rushing over so soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the exhausted look on his face, he knew that Baron Redman had rushed over quickly. Obviously, he attaches as much importance to this matter as Hudson himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Of course I have to hurry up for this kind of thing. If you come late and someone else takes the opportunity, wouldn't you regret it to death!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tired after tired, watching his son soar into the sky, as a father, Redman is really happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, he opened a box, carefully took out two pieces of parchment, and handed it to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the dense lines and small notes on it, Hudson's expression lifted. The above content is actually a map of the two counties of Wright and Wyton. Even some important resources are marked with the code words of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't be surprised, nobles with a deep heritage will have these things. Although the Koslow family is not a big family, it has been passed down for thousands of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the family also has roots in Wright and Wyton. It's a pity that the two unlucky Garrett and Weber lost their lives in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, they all had sons away, and they were not handed over by the rebels, so they finally kept their foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adrian and his son have worked with the Dalton family for two generations, and have accumulated a lot of credit. If there is no accident, there is a high probability that they will be able to get a fief this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know what's going on with Leicester and Crohn. If they can also obtain the fief, then the family's right to speak in the two counties will be guaranteed in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Baron Redman's words, Hudson suddenly realized that his family seemed to be the big winner of this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, father. Knight Adrian is in good condition. He is guarding the gate for Earl Pierce. I visited yesterday.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Knight of Leicester and the Baron of Crohn, I met them face to face at the just-concluded banquet. It's just that they are very busy recently, whether they can get what they want depends on the upcoming activities. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to say, but deep down, Hudson is not optimistic about their plan. There is no way, the Koslow family has gained too much in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the knighthood is based on military exploits, then even if someone is upset, it is hard to stop it due to the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they are not very lucky and have not gained enough military exploits. It can only be the idea of ​​extinct relatives, and there are more people with inheritance rights. This is a muddled account.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Adrian Knights don't get the fief, maybe they have a chance. I just listened to what Baron Redman said. Adrian's father's generation had been with the Dalton family, and there was no credit but hard work. There was no reason not to give him a fief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A knight's collar + a barony's collar is already dazzling enough among minor nobles. If you want to get the third fief again, what do the nobles who got nothing think?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe they can't accomplish anything, but they definitely have the ability to do bad things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Take one of them casually, it's blood money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I can only try hard. There are quite a few forces staring at the land of the two counties. Not only the nobles in the southeastern province, but also big forces from the royal capital and other regions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the nobles in the north, if they have the opportunity to go south, they will not give up. The most important thing is that they do not lack military exploits in their hands, which invisibly increases the right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we want to compete with them, our biggest advantage is that we have been rooted in the southeast province for a longer time and can easily obtain the support of local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secondly, my Koslow family is too weak to pose a danger to the Dalton family, and it is possible to gain the support of Earl Pierce. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he still knows the kingdom politics well. It is not taken for granted that all those participating in the competition are local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to his colleagues, Hudson is indeed powerful in battle, but he is far from the northern nobles who have been stationed in the northern border all the year round and have a shopping battle with orcs every now and then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom must reward these heroes. Almost every year, fief nobles are born in the Northland, but most of these people are high-spirited and upright, and have declined the fiefdoms bestowed by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing surprising. Compared with other regions of the kingdom where the situation is stable, the political reshuffle in the Northland is the fastest. After round after round of wars, the weak and small nobles were all eliminated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best land in northern Xinjiang almost all fell into the hands of several big nobles. The rest of the land is either too barren or threatened by orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparable to the fiefdom of an uninhabited village, you can't see any benefits, but you have to bear the obligations of the fief lord, and Hudson will not want it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of small and medium-sized nobles, including the Koslow family, could not withstand the long-term devastation of the orcs, and were forced to shift their development direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After two hundred years of reshuffle, Northern Xinjiang has completely become the territory of several big nobles, and the situation began to change from this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beastmen have no small and medium nobles to grab, so naturally they can only grab big nobles. Although these guys are not easy to mess with, but they are hungry, but no one cares so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every season when there is a shortage of crops, the orcs will definitely harass the Northland, and all the great nobles are also tossed enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win, you will lose money, if you lose, you will lose money. The orcs are like psoriasis, sticking to their bodies, sucking their blood continuously, and can't throw it away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the big nobles are thinking about the good of the small and medium nobles. It's a pity that everyone is scared of being tricked. Even if many preferential policies are promised, few nobles have taken root in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in Hudson's view, few people pass by. The main reason is that the risks and benefits are not directly proportional.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the small and medium nobles, once they catch up with the large-scale invasion of orcs, the big nobles will also be cold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last continental war, the Alpha Kingdom suffered heavy losses. Even the royal family's direct territory in northern Xinjiang lost three provinces, which directly led to the decline of the royal family's power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few great nobles who have been beaten and disabled. If it weren't for the reinforcements from various countries in the mainland, the Alpha Kingdom might have become history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is very skeptical that the neighbors around the Alpha Kingdom did not attack the Alpha Kingdom, but spent their money to support it. The main reason is that they do not want to be neighbors with orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this point, the Warhammer Kingdom and the Principality of Moxi, who are next door, have a very good say. Ever since the Alpha Kingdom lost its city and land for strategic contraction, they have passively bordered on the Orc Empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original orc threat faced by the Alpha Kingdom family has become a joint response by the three families. The most direct consequence is that since they became neighbors with orcs, their territory has not expanded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the city and territory were lost, there were two more unlucky guys to share the firepower, and the pressure on the defense of the Alpha Kingdom dropped sharply. After decades of recuperation, the comprehensive national strength has gone one step further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guys in the North are now clamoring to unite the two neighbors to launch a counterattack against the orc empire and regain the kingdom's homeland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, just listen to this kind of slogan. If they could do it well, the Three Kingdoms would have joined forces to fight over it long ago, so how could they keep swallowing their anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orcs did not dare to invade wantonly, they were not afraid of the alliance of the three countries, but what really made them fearful was the intervention of other human nations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overlord of the continent of Aslant is the human race after all. If the human race hadn't split into dozens of countries, there would be no room for other races to survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a group of powerful competitors. After a little thought, Hudson crossed out a few more goals. Intuition told him that it is better not to be too greedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, the family already has two territories in Wyton County. Due to the need for checks and balances, there is a high probability that my territory will be placed in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the fiefdom of Wright County is planned directly, the probability of success should be higher. If it doesn't work, then settle for the next best thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this big reshuffle, many territories should be split and merged, and some newly merged territories can also be considered. If it works properly, the benefits may be even greater. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inherent territory, the scope is clear, it is impossible to get more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reorganized territory is different, and all boundaries need to be redrawn. As long as the connections are in place and the boundary line is moved outward by 180 meters, there may be an additional village.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson put his finger on a corner in southern Wright County. Except for the three knight territories here, the rest are the territories of the former Viscount Alphonse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not known whether the three knights have extinct heirs, but the whole family of Viscount Alphonse received the lunch box.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dadir city he left behind is attractive enough, and the probability of the other half of the county being swallowed up by others is very small. Even the Dalton family did not dare to do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the king canonize a prince to come, but the generation of the Alpha Kingdom is the only seedling, and if they want to stay in the capital to inherit the throne, it is impossible to come and grab the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few inconspicuous hills can attract Hudson's attention entirely because there is an iron mine with a lot of reserves in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No large-scale mining was carried out. The main reason is that Wright County lacks coal, so it can only be smelted with charcoal, and the production efficiency is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a disadvantage, but also an advantage. If there are associated coal mines in the local area, it is not Hudson's turn to plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you have to think about it. The iron ore reserves of the Salam vein are indeed rich. When it was discovered that year, it caused a sensation in the entire southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the entire southeastern province is short of coal. There are a few coal mines, but the quality is too low. The quality of the smelted iron is not good enough, so it cannot be used to forge weapons at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the high transportation cost, Viscount Alphonse has always used charcoal for smelting, and the ironware produced can only be used to make daily necessities such as farm tools and iron pots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the income from iron ore is good, the local land is relatively barren, and the food production is not high, so it is difficult to be self-sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comprehensive calculation, the income you can get is not too high, far less valuable than the other fiefdoms. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman reminded earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An explanation is impossible. It cannot be said that he learned steelmaking knowledge in his previous life, which can improve the efficiency and quality of smelting, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, don't worry, this is just an alternative plan. The information marked on the map is all past data. What is the specific situation, it is best to go and check it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the land is too barren, or the iron ore is not as expected, then abandon this land and seek other fertile land. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson pointed at the cub. Baron Redman, who had an ugly face, suddenly felt much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prospecting methods on the continent of Aslant have always been full of magic. Either hire an alchemist, or use a monster with special talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the darling of the earth, the Earth Bear is born to be an excellent mineral vein explorer, but the outside world only pays attention to its powerful power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Actions before this can only be regarded as a warm-up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was also a door-to-door visit, and Hudson clearly felt the difference between the two visits. It's not everyone's snobbery, but mainly because of the debt of favor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either take back the favor that was sold before, or owe the other party a favor on behalf of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, everyone is aristocratic, so it must be shameful. On the surface, the two sides are simply talking about the old days, and all transactions are unspoken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with simple gift giving, this kind of favor transaction within the circle is undoubtedly more in line with the appetite of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yesterday I helped you, today you help me, and the day after tomorrow I will help you again... After repeated cycles, you gradually become family friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now Hudson and his son are visiting family friends of the Koslow family, and at least three generations of ancestors have started to have relationships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the relationship is close, there is no guarantee of success every time. The premise of helping is to first protect your own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever the owner expressed embarrassment, Baron Redman would decisively change the topic, and then quickly said his goodbyes and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's mentality is very good throughout the whole process. It is a kindness to help, and it is also a duty not to help. Family friendship does not mean that you must help unconditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on their personal connections, the Hudsons also inquired about a lot of news, the most important one being the king's ruling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    this point is very important. If Earl Pierce's proposal is passed and enfeoffment is limited to the baronial level, then there is a high probability that there will be no direct descendants of great nobles among the northern Xinjiang nobles who go south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Qianglong is not strong enough, which means that local snakes like Hudson can compete with it. This kind of situation is what Earl Pierce wants to see the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a conflict in the feudal scramble, and the Dalton family provoked a little from behind the scenes, and the local nobles in the southeastern province would inevitably have conflicts with these outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not qualified to participate in the high-level game. Taking advantage of the time before the fiefdom competition, after visiting all the old friends, he immediately appeared in the Salam Mountains with the cub and dozens of guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To say it is a mountain range is purely flattering. In the southeastern province of Yimapingchuan, the so-called mountains are small soil bumps, and the same is true for the Salam Mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is composed of more than a hundred hills of different sizes, like giant steamed buns placed on the ground. It took more than two hours for Hudson and his party to choose the highest mountain from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relative height of most of the hills does not exceed 200 meters. They are obviously hills. Calling mountains is the last stubbornness of the nobles in the southeastern provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Arrived at the Salam mining area, there was only one word on the scene - chaos. Production had stopped long ago, the site was a mess, and the miners were nowhere to be found.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Picked up a stalactite-shaped iron ore from the ground, swayed it around in front of the cub, and said in a bewitching tone: \"Bear Stearns, it's time for you to perform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the future will be animal milk + honey every day, or poor enough to eat dirt, depends on today's wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is this kind of stone, how much is buried in the ground, how deep is it from the surface, give me an approximate data. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bewildered brat looked at Hudson with resentment on his face. Since signing the contract, it has been cheated more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did the food standard promised in advance fail to meet, but they were also forced to come out to work. If it hadn't been for the accelerated speed of training with Hudson, and the temptation of animal milk and honey, it would have gone on strike and run away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shaking his head for a while, pointing his bear paws to the front, he led Hudson and his party through the mountains and forests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning over one hill after another, if the cub hadn't repeatedly ensured that he didn't go to the wrong place, Hudson would have suspected it was playing a prank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The extension of the veins is wider than that marked in the Hudson data. It is no wonder that the grain production in this hill is low. The ground is full of iron ore, and there is only a layer of soil above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are ores exposed on the ground in many areas, and large-scale mining has not been carried out. It is estimated that the unlucky Viscount did not pay attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the smelted iron cannot be forged into weapons, it loses its strategic value. Just producing pots and pans, farm tools, etc., is not worth the trouble of the noble master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crossing the hills all the way, before finally coming to a swamp, Hudson decisively stopped the cub from moving forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earth Bear can walk on the ground in the mud, but it doesn't mean he can too. In case of sinking in, if you die, you will lose face to the traverser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smelling the fragrance of the soil and looking at the boundless swamp, Hudson was very puzzled. How could such important information not be marked on the map?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think there is no development value? Or were the ancestors negligent and did not investigate deeply?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson finally gave up the idea of ​​in-depth exploration. Anyway, the swamp is here, and he won't run away, so there will be plenty of opportunities in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this also intensified Hudson's determination to seek this place. Hilly areas are not suitable for agricultural production, not to mention swampy land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because it is not conducive to food production, except for the mines, most of this hilly area is not on the map, which means that it is not registered by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the land of no man, whoever develops it belongs to him. If he becomes the southernmost fief lord in Wright County, no one will compete with Hudson at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the development is a bit difficult, the corresponding benefits are also great. Especially the swampland in the south, once developed, it will be a natural granary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that there are hills ahead, which can be regarded as a rare and dangerous place in the southeastern province. Even if a war breaks out, it is possible to use the hills for defense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Powerful enemies may not be able to stop them, but chaos at the level of the Skull and Bones rebels can still be defended with a high probability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In these years, everyone is using serfs to play farming, and the population cannot flow without the approval of the noble lord. If the news is sealed well, the outside world may not know about it after ten or eight years of development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No time wasted here, following the pace of the cubs, Hudson and his party continued to determine the distribution of the veins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it can also be roughly judged from the vegetation. In the area where the ore is relatively shallow, most of the plants growing are trees, and a few old trees are crumbling and not tall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Out of the mining area, or the area where the ore is buried deeper, the vegetation will be much more lush, and the signs of wild beast activities will be more obvious. If it is for food production, the output will look much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What delighted Hudson the most was that along the way, he also found many mountain people and miners who had avoided the war. Labor was at a premium in post-war Wrightshire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't bother them, now is not the time to accept younger brothers. The task of Hudson is very heavy, and the inspection of the Salam Mountains is only the beginning, and several other candidate areas also need to be checked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no one knows when an accident will happen. Before the dust settles, no one can guarantee that there will be no moths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the plan fails, there must always be alternatives. As a cautious owner, Hudson doesn't want to be in a hurry when things come to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Without the slightest hesitation, after completing the washing as quickly as possible, he and Baron Redman got into the carriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, what happened in the city recently?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the leader of the southeastern province, Earl Pierce is very cold. According to the past practice, it was not Hudson's turn to attend the banquet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people do not invite, Hudson will not go to make fun of himself. The difference in strength and status between the two parties is too great, even if they want to flatter him, it's not his turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not because of the fiefdom. Especially those guys who are fighting for the right to inherit, they don't have any integrity. In recent days, the conflicts in the city have never stopped.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said with a look of contempt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't have the slightest affection for those guys who don't have enough military merit and try to eat their relatives out of their homes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that I can't eat it at home. Just doing public relations for Hudson consumes a lot of contacts, and there is no energy at all to mix and eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this kind of occasion, the little people have to arrive quickly, and leave early to come to the banquet, and the scene is still full of people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sure enough, everyone had the same idea. Those who arrive early may not necessarily leave a good impression on the governor, but those who arrive late will definitely leave a bad impression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the fight for the fiefdom, the alliance of small and medium-sized nobles in the southeastern province has already collapsed, and the initiative has once again returned to Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He kept saying hello to people along the way. At this time, the benefits of familiar faces were reflected. Hudson was able to chat with most of the nobles present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the real power faction who works in the Governor's Mansion, as long as they meet, Hudson will definitely go over and have a few words. Uncle and other titles kept calling, and the scene was full of laughter and laughter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nodding acquaintance is also friendship, not using it for nothing. The prosperous Koslow family is famous for having many relatives. The complicated relationship between them may not be clear to one's own people, let alone outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the person involved does not explain, it will fall into the eyes of the outside world. This is an invisible deterrent. Especially for a group of competitors, it is a kind of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone is here, it seems that everyone is giving me face! This is very good, the nobles in my southeastern province want to maintain this kind of unity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I invite everyone to come here today. In addition to reminiscing about the past, the more important thing is to discuss the future ownership of the two counties of Wright and Wyton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, I would like to declare here that the legitimacy of the aristocratic inheritance system must be guaranteed. Everything must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the \"Continental Succession Law\". Anyone who dares to break the rules is the common enemy of all of us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I believe that everyone here is an example of nobles, there will be no such scumbags, and everyone will not allow such nobless to exist. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are established procedures, and the \"Continental Succession Law\" is a rule jointly maintained by the noble group, with the purpose of safeguarding the common interests of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any family will inevitably decline one day, and no one wants their property to fall into the hands of others. This can be regarded as a rare warmth in the aristocratic world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Governor is right, the \"Continental Inheritance Law\" must be complied with. All direct heirs who meet the requirements of the Inheritance Law can be prioritized for them to go through the inheritance procedures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All we need to talk about are unclaimed lands, and territories whose succession is contested. For the specific disposal plan, I think His Excellency the Earl should have a complete plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Oran said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be cooperating with Governor Pierce, but also seems to be dissatisfied with his arbitrariness, and his tone is full of contradictions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has long been familiar with this scene. None of the powerful viscounts in the province had a good relationship with Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The minor nobles cannot threaten the interests of the Dalton family, but the middle nobles are different. Although the strengths of the two sides are still vastly different, once the great nobles decline, they have the capital to replace them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to consolidate their own rule, as the boss of the southeastern province, the Dalton family has always taken measures to suppress these middle-class families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Unwilling to be inferior to others, the middle-class nobles chose to join the king without hesitation, and gathered a group of younger brothers to sing against the Dalton family in the province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference in strength does not affect the battle of words. Within the rule system, no matter how violent the disturbance was, the Dalton family could not directly attack them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the northern border area where the nobles dominate, the rest of the kingdom is playing with checks and balances. Everyone unites and fights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, right now, the troubles will return to the troubles, and it will not affect everyone to join hands to resist the nobles from the North going south, and jointly carve up the unowned land in the two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaring at Viscount Oran, Earl Pierce said slowly: \"The legal heirs who meet the succession regulations and are not in dispute can come to the Governor's Mansion to go through the succession procedures from tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We will send it to the capital as quickly as possible, and it will take effect after the king's approval. Before that, you can take over the territory in advance, but you must not use large amounts of wealth, or do things that damage the rights and interests of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the agreement reached between the Governor's Mansion and the Kingdom, Wright and Wyton Counties will set aside one-sixth of the land as the fiefdom of military nobles in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific candidates have not been determined, but the general scope has been delineated. Today we will discuss the disposal of the remaining areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opinion of the Governor's Office is: according to the merits in the counter-insurgency war, select the matching territories in order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Territories where the right to succession is disputed, follow the order of: direct blood lineage first, military merit second, and collateral lineage second.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have a better distribution plan, you can propose it now. If it satisfies everyone, it can also be carried out according to your plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, regardless of whether everyone could accept it or not, a huge sand table was lifted up by the guards from the outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the production is a little ugly and the error is a little bigger, it can be roughly seen that this is a map of two counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are lines of different colors on it, which divide the two counties into several small pieces of different sizes, and there are place names marked on wooden signs of different colors beside them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that Earl Pierce is going to cut the mess quickly, and he is unwilling to keep making trouble like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the so-called solicitation of opinions, it is purely polite. If you want everyone to be satisfied, even if the land of the two counties is expanded ten times, it is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that no one came out to speak against it, Earl Pierce said with satisfaction: \"The areas marked by the red wooden sign are all owned, so don't worry about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The areas marked by the blue wooden sign are all disputed inheritance rights. Negotiations can be carried out according to the inheritance principles we agreed upon, and if there is no agreement, the aristocratic council of the southeastern province will make a decision according to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the white wooden signs are all land of no man. The meritorious officials who are qualified to obtain the fiefdom can be selected in order, and if other people have objections, they can raise them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the negotiation fails, the old rule will be decided by the noble council. Anyway, the representatives are basically here, so it is right to vote on the spot, and it will not delay everyone's time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the colored wooden signs one by one, Hudson realized that he was simply thinking too much. Not only is it difficult to compete for a rich land, but it has never flowed out at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the city, Hudson never expected from the beginning that this kind of stuffed pie could fall on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even among the dozen or so targets that were delineated in advance, there are only three of them belonging to No Man's Land. It is conceivable how intense the competition will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at Earl Pierce's nice talk, but in fact he follows the law of the jungle. The family is strong and has many supporters, so it can naturally become the winner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, even if you are the first choice, if you are not strong enough, you will not be able to keep it in the end. It's better to be knighted for military merit, at worst, you won't get a piece of bad land, and you won't return empty-handed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the others, once the fight for the fief fails, all previous efforts will be in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he wanted the Salam mining area the most, and it was also in the land of no man, otherwise Hudson would be blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After everyone had digested it, a huge red cloth was hung on the wall of the hall. Hudson quickly found his name on it, and he was the first person on the list.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is indeed fair. According to the principle of political priority, Hudson, who killed the most Holy See cavalry, is the proper number one hero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just surprising that Earl Pierce's name is not on it. In the continent of Aslante, there is not one person with one title, and it is common to hold several titles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the great nobles, who don't have a string of titles on them. If it is a title that can be achieved in one step, which idiot king will bestow tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of land at once?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether you are high-spirited or have other plans. Anyway, Hudson is not interested in the plans of the big shots, let alone \"dare\" to be interested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without giving in, Hudson took the lead to walk to the sand table, picked up a small flag and planted it in the area in front of the Salam mining area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is enough to mark a point to determine the approximate range, and the specific territory division must be down to show their talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small flag fell, and Hudson immediately received a few kind glances. It can be seen that several powerful factions are very satisfied with his choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Salam mining area has a lot of output, it is limited by factors such as lack of coal and low food production. Taking all factors into consideration, it can only be regarded as medium among all the territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the strength of the Koslow family, winning this hilly area can only be regarded as quite satisfactory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several viscounts smiled and signaled, and Hudson knew that the dust had settled. Even if the rest wants to object, it depends on whether the fist is hard enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Very well, since everyone has no objection, then the southernmost mountainous area of ​​Wright County is tentatively designated as the fief of Baron Hudson.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Earl Pierce's voice fell to the ground, Hudson gained another nickname \"The Baron of the Mountain\". Before that, everyone affectionately called him \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the former, the latter is obviously more deterrent. In a sense, a large part of the reason why Hudson was able to get along so well in the aristocratic circle was also brought about by the \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People always like to make friends with the strong. Like Hudson, who shoots an arrow and kills, a proper battlefield killer is the best comrade-in-arms partner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many wars on the Aslant continent, and there will be more days for everyone to work together in the future. Improve the relationship, and maybe you can save a life from the battlefield at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

From the start of the fight for the second territory, the scene has never been more harmonious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that everyone doesn't want to coordinate, it's really impossible to coordinate. Once the fief is determined, there is almost no possibility of replacement. If you take a step back now, you may regret it for a lifetime in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a barony, the best fiefdom and the worst fiefdom, but the annual income gap may be as high as tens of thousands of gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, that is a theoretical number, and the current two counties must not reach it. Without ten or eight years of hard work, it is impossible to return to the peak level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Salam mining area selected by Hudson almost monopolizes the supply of pig iron in the whole county, and its products also have a high market share in the surrounding counties, which is a proper high-yield area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the labor cost of mining is high, and part of the charcoal used for smelting needs to be purchased, and the local food production can only meet part of the demand, which also dilutes the mineral income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that the mine will eventually be mined one day, but the food production can be infinitely recycled, which invisibly reduces the value of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is the view of the outside world. For Hudson, industries that can be realized in a short period of time are the best industries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It takes too long to complete the primitive accumulation of wealth by farming. For most aristocrats, the first twenty years of landholding were poor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, both Wright and Wyton counties are well-developed lands, and the situation is much better. As long as the labor force is supplemented, it will soon be able to recover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the local snakes, after decades of peace, most of the aristocratic territories have a certain amount of rich labor force, which undoubtedly reduces the difficulty of developing new territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outsiders are more tragic, and they can only purchase slaves on a large scale to serve as labor. As for the migration of people from the northern border, the kingdom was the first to refuse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of national defense and security, the kingdom exiles a large number of criminals to guard the border every year. It has always been that only the inflow of people is allowed, and the outflow of people is not allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces have the task of forced population transfer every year. If the number is not enough, a group of nobles will have to spend money to buy slaves to make up the number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the captives captured in the suppression of the Skull and Bones rebellion not long ago, they were escorted to the northern border in batches. Later, there are orcs responsible for pulling hatred, which can be regarded as solving the conflict once and for all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom is relatively peaceful, because it shoulders the important task of resisting the invasion of the orc empire, and dare not have too much fun in internal and external fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be different to have a multi-ethnic country without the threat of foreign races, how happy it is. A small battle in three months and a big battle in five months, war is the mainstream of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In every war, a large number of captives are produced. According to the rules, they will be released after paying the ransom. After a certain period of time, if no money is paid, they will be sold as slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching everyone arguing, Hudson has become a spectator. In the middle and later stages of development, not only the parties involved came out to fight each other, but even the supportive relatives and friends joined the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene was extremely chaotic. If Earl Pierce was not pressing on it, it is estimated that these guys would be able to stage a full-scale martial arts on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ruling of the noble council is also full of gunpowder. The huge disparity in strength between the two sides is okay, but the most fearful thing is that their own strength and network of connections are evenly matched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If no result can be obtained from the quarrel, then vote. According to the kingdom's \"Aristocratic Act\", all nobles who own fiefdoms are members of the noble council.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules: one vote for a knight, three votes for a baron, ten votes for a viscount, and thirty votes for an earl... With the accumulation of multiple fiefdoms, the voting will be conducted directly on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, the benefits of a large number of people are reflected. Including a few nobles who did not participate in this war due to special reasons, the Koslow family has two barons + nine knights who have the right to vote. The total number of votes from their own members is as high as 15.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson, Adrian, and the other two clansmen who inherited the title, because they haven't completed the legal procedures, don't have the right to vote for the time being, otherwise they can add another eight votes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eight votes were missing, and the most direct consequence was the plans of the Knights of Leicester and Baron Crohn, who lost by two and three votes respectively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the annoyed two, the Hudson father and son didn't know how to comfort them, so they could only pretend not to see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failure is an inevitable result, even if there are eight more votes, it will not change anything. The difference in the number of votes is small, it is Earl Pierce who is leading the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the vote king of the southeastern province, Earl Pierce, who holds multiple positions, has fifty-four votes alone. With the nobles influenced by him, the number of votes he can control is even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the need for political balance, the thing that fell from the sky is destined not to fall on the Koslow family this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't participate by yourself, you can only watch others perform. Hudson had personally seen Baron Redman, and filled in different names on the three ballot papers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at my father's calm expression, he seems to support multiple candidates at the same time. This kind of coquettish manipulation is nothing new in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all friends of my family, or they have received multiple gifts. For the sake of peace of mind, such a scene usually occurs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only family friends and relatives will everyone vote for all the votes in their hands at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The seemingly funny scene is not a kind of political wisdom. Hudson, who thought he was already a qualified nobleman, suddenly found that he still had a lot to learn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noisy banquet lasted until the next morning, and finally completed the carve-up feast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The final result is that some families are happy and some are sad. As one of the victors, Hudson is in a good mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the carriage, looking at his energetic son, Baron Redman instructed earnestly: \"Hudson, determining the fief area is only the first step, and the next step is the key.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I got a piece of news from Adrian just now. Your Excellency the Governor is in a hurry to implement the fief matters, mainly because of the group of outsiders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that this time the governor's mansion and the capital were very tense. Although the king agreed to Earl Pierce's proposal that the highest canonization be limited to barons, he gave the city of Dardir and the city of Harvest to other people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three children of the Dalton family who served in the Northland only won one barony and two knights, which made Earl Pierce very dissatisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being preyed upon by others, the Dalton family will definitely not let it go. A counterattack is bound to be launched next, and what exactly will be done is unknown, but the high probability is related to the fiefdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family is not ranked among the kingdoms, unable to participate in the battle of the big forces. If a conflict breaks out next, you must be careful not to get involved in the vortex of the storm. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nodding his head cautiously, Hudson immediately assured: \"Don't worry, father. It's too late to hide from this kind of thing, how can I take the initiative to participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobleman who can jump out of the quagmire in the Northland and **** food from the Dalton family's tiger's mouth, has definitely not a simple background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the risk of offending the No. 1 nobleman in the southeastern province, a mere baronial land will definitely not satisfy their appetite, and there will be another battle between dragons and tigers in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But they are outsiders after all, and the power of the family in the two counties is not small. As long as our territories keep watch over each other, self-defense is enough. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's easy to say, but Hudson's heart is actually not peaceful. Although he knew that there were northern nobles going south, he didn't expect that this group of powerful dragons could directly take food from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The county city was taken away by these guys, so the next battle for the head of the county will probably not have any suspense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is clear that the big reshuffle of the two counties has just begun, and they plan to use this as the foundation of the county to slowly plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, it depends on how strong the support of the forces behind them is, and whether they can withstand the counterattack of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who wins and who loses in the end, the little nobles in the two counties will have a hard time for a long time to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Koslow family has four fiefdom nobles who can form a group, two of them have been seriously injured in the previous Skull and Bones rebellion, and the other two have just set foot in this place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What worries Hudson the most is Adrian Knight. He has been hanging out with Earl Pierce, and the imprint of the Dalton family on him is too strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a conflict between the two sides, everyone else can find a way to avoid it, but Adrian cannot back down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the situation expands, maybe I will be passively involved. However, Hudson still has no choice. If he wants to gain more in the division of fiefs, he cannot do without the support of the Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trouble is in the future, but benefits are within reach. I have truly experienced that people can't help themselves in the aristocratic circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

This time Earl Pierce did a good deed. He directly placed the office window of the Governor's Mansion in Dardir City, so he didn't need to travel all the way to Beida.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Registration is complete, and then there is a long waiting period. Hudson belongs to the nobles of the kingdom, not the retainers of some great nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the rules of the kingdom, the canonization of nobles in the kingdom must be approved by the king to be effective. To be precise, a real noble must be conferred by the king himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom has a vast territory. The more than 20 provinces in the country together have a total area of ​​several million square kilometers and a population of tens of millions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In such a huge kingdom, the replacement of nobles happens almost every day. If the king canonize every time there is a change, then Caesar III doesn't have to do anything, just hold the nobility canonization ceremony every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of convenience, the royal nobility conferring ceremony is held every five years. At that time, all the nobles who need to be canonized will arrive at the royal capital to accept the official canonization of the king together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The succession and canonization of titles before this are also valid, but before the procedure is completed, part of the rights of the nobility is missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In the aristocratic council, there are only the powers of listening and making suggestions, but not the right to propose and vote.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are small issues. For Hudson, whether it is a proposal in the parliament or a vote, it is far away from him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the aristocratic council of the southeast province, one can see that voting on such a sacred matter is actually held at a banquet hosted by the governor, and one knows how watery this thing is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After packing his bags and preparing to take his troops to the territory, Baron Redman suddenly brought a bow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I bought this from an old friend. It is said that it is the exclusive bow and arrow of the elves. Although there is no magic device, the power is not comparable to ordinary bows and arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the hands of ordinary people, it is pure waste. Hudson go for it, hope it can unleash real power in the hands. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said slightly happily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't mentioned it inadvertently in a conversation with an old friend, he would not have known that his son was the famous \"Knight of the Bow\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, he still feels like he is dreaming. After all, Hudson's talent is something that he, a father, knows all too well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But facts speak louder than words. When people around him started to say that, Baron Redman could only understand that this was Hudson deliberately hiding his clumsiness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are too many legends about Hudson. They obviously brought 500 serf soldiers with them before they set off, but everyone said they were 500 elite soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Explanations are useless. Not only did they cite their achievements as evidence, but they also swore that they had seen them fight with their own eyes. This made Baron Redman a little suspicious, whether the five hundred elite troops he sent were not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there are still those familiar faces in the camp. Although some strangers have been added, most of them are still his subjects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't know, then don't bother to delve into it. The outside world thinks it is elite, so let this beautiful misunderstanding continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the rumors are not completely useless, at least it scares countless peepers and reduces a lot of unnecessary troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of elite soldiers + a sharpshooter with an earth bear, the strength that can be displayed is enough to make countless small and medium nobles fear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking over the bow and arrow, Hudson immediately noticed something unusual. Ordinary bows and arrows are mainly made of hardwood and cowhide, but this special bow and arrow of the elves is mainly made of mysterious rattan and monster tendons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trying to nock an arrow, Hudson was surprised to find that he almost exhausted all his strength, but he couldn't draw the bow to the full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a sound of \"whoosh\", the arrow actually flew more than ten meters away after penetrating a big tree two hundred meters away and plunged into a boulder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power is indeed great, but it is a pity that it consumes too much energy. With such a strong attack, even Hudson could not shoot a few arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is indeed a good bow, but unfortunately the arrows are not very good, otherwise the power it can exert will be even greater!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sighed with embarrassment. If the bow is not fully drawn, it is definitely the fault of the quality of the arrows, not him, the \"knight of the bow\", who broke down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"That's pretty good too. It seems that this bow is really suitable for you. With it for you, as long as you don't give the enemy a chance to get close, even a great knight can't catch a few arrows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivate the Earth Bear well, it is your strongest support. As long as it survives its infancy, its combat power can surpass many silver knights; if it is lucky enough to be trained to adulthood, you will be one of the strongest knights in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is such a day, we can rebuild the glory of the family, return to the ranks of the middle nobles again, and even hope to be like the Dalton family...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what his father said, Hudson found helplessly that his hopes for the cub were greater than for himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In theory, there seems to be nothing wrong with it. Under normal circumstances, it would take more than two hundred years for Xiong Guang of the Earth to reach adulthood, but as long as he is willing to spend some money, this time can still be brought forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for ripening, the growth cycle of monsters is so long, and no one would contract cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the territory Hudson chose is suitable for making quick money in the short term. It is not surprising that it was misunderstood to cultivate the Earth Bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one came out to make trouble. That's because the higher the level of Warcraft, the more difficult it is to ripen it in advance. Many things that need to be used cannot be bought with money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of most people, before the Earth Bear becomes an adult, Hudson will receive the box lunch first. Liberty Bear, who is not bound by a contract, will not continue to work for the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Father, let's discuss this issue later! It is imperative that we rush to the territory as soon as possible to resume production at the mine.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to other nobles, he has calm capital. It takes one season for food production to yield a harvest, but as long as mining and iron smelting resume production, profits can be seen in ten and a half months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Salt, iron, grain, and cloth are all hard commodities recognized in the mainland. There may be fluctuations in prices, but there is absolutely no problem of not being able to sell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two counties of Wright and Wyton have been severely affected, and will face the problem of labor shortage for a long time to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the lords want to restore agricultural production, they must purchase more and more advanced production tools to make up for the impact of labor shortage. It is only a matter of time before iron farm tools replace traditional farm tools on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to make a fortune is close at hand, and Hudson doesn't want to miss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"However, on the other side of the territory, you can go there by yourself. With your name as a knight of the bow and the false name of your family's private army, no one will think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Berio and Guarente, two unlucky children, are different. He lost his parents early on, and his family business was wiped out by the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few people who are eyeing them now. If the family doesn't help, I'm afraid they will die in a short time and their territory will be annexed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You will need to fund your territory construction in the future. Our team is unable to provide them with much support in terms of money and food, but military support is essential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'll take someone there to watch first. After your two elder brothers return, they will be permanently stationed in Wyton County in the next few years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several other branches of the family will also send people there. Before their private army is cultivated, the family's resident knights in Wyton County will not be less than eight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in trouble, you can also go to ask for help. However, given your reputation in the southeastern province, the probability of such a thing happening is not high. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Redman said with a look of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The son is capable, he has won the country by himself, and he doesn't need to worry about being a father, but it allows him to save face in front of all his old friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though there are quite a few eight knights, if they are really placed together with the \"Knight of the Bow\" who holds an \"elite soldier\", everyone would rather look for the bad luck of the eight knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former can still run if he can't beat it, but if he encounters the latter, he might not be able to get close and lie down early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to this, Hudson naturally has no objections. To enjoy the benefits brought by the family, it is natural to assume corresponding obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching each other is the key to the Koslow family's survival. Now that there are people in the same family who need help, naturally they can't just sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family invested so much power, obviously not to guard against the nobles of the southeastern provinces. Everyone is in the same circle, and the grandparents are more or less passionate after marriage, and they will not easily break the rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Profit is temporary, but reputation is lifelong. If you want to mix in this small circle, you must pay attention to eating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can secretly plan and plan, and slowly wait for the other party to decline, or even become extinct, but they cannot go over and do black hands in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only outsiders who are not bound by the rules of the circle can break the rules recklessly. As long as some taboos are not violated, even if the eating looks a little ugly, everyone will be more able to accept it in their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outsiders are already squeezed out, and they don't care about paying more. If you want to gain everyone's approval, the best way is to rely on your fist to convince everyone, and the problem of being excluded will naturally disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the convoy full of supplies, Hudson was in a particularly happy mood. This is still the result of processing a large amount of old materials, otherwise it would not be possible for a hundred horse-drawn carts to hold them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"War changes fate\", this is the most authentic portrayal of the continent of Aslante. Just a war against chaos made Hudson jump up, from a knight who was about to wander into a noble fief baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bamboo spears and orchid shields used at the start have now been replaced with broadswords and spears. There are not a few soldiers holding battle hammers and battle axes, and many of them even carry a bow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team also changed from the original 500 serfs to a team of 637 veterans. Just looking at it from afar will make you feel the chill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing in common is: this team still continues the tradition of advancing at a fast pace, without the slightest galloping arrogance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of updated words has increased, and the votes have increased. Haiyue needs votes to encourage...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In order to ensure the smooth passage of the convoy, they had to stop to level the road from time to time, but these small episodes did not affect Hudson's good mood in the slightest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After several months of trembling, I finally got a piece of land of my own. Hudson now finds everything pleasing to the eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You idiots, with a few broken logs, dare to rob like others. If you run into the great Hudson, you will definitely...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the voice coming from ahead, Hudson got out of the carriage full of anger, and someone dared to rob him, it was simply bullying him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting out of the carriage, Hudson realized something was wrong. The so-called robbery is purely a farce. It is more appropriate to say that it is a refugee than a robber.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers mainly reprimanded them, and did not directly kill them. The main reason was that most of the people blocking the road were old, weak, women and children, and only a few were young and strong. They really didn't look like bandits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, what's going on?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who are they?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Why intercept the convoy?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked three times in a row, Tom was about to answer, but the crowd on the opposite side spoke first: \"Dear Lord Hudson, we are all the subjects of Viscount Alphonse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, I encountered a military disaster and was robbed of food, and now I can't find the lord, so...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, I know what you want to ask! Unfortunately, Viscount Alphonse was in trouble, and his whole family was lost at the hands of the rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The new lord is from the Northland, and it will take another month to arrive if it is as fast as possible, and it will not exceed three months at the slowest, and it will naturally arrange for you when the time comes. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be indifferent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former statement that Viscount Alphonse's family suffered is true, but the latter statement is pure nonsense. When the northern nobles will be able to arrive, we will only know when they arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nobility is not only an honor, but also a responsibility. Different from idlers like them who are ready to take office at any time, the nobles who hold military positions in the frontier, even if they get a fief, they have to complete the handover with the substitutes before they can leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If wars and conflicts break out, it will be even worse. Whether he can leave alive is still unknown. Even the children of big families cannot slip away during the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the bad news, the crowd quickly fell into a panic, all of them looked ashen, as if the sky had fallen, and two of the old men even passed out directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They have always depended on Viscount Alphonse for their survival, and they never thought about how to live without the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Serfs basically had no private property, and all production tools belonged to the nobles. The corresponding clothing, food, housing, transportation, birth, old age, sickness and death are naturally also the responsibility of the noble master.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food and goods of the noble lords have been robbed by people, and everyone can support them until now, they are all relying on wild vegetables, grass roots, and bark to make ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say it's three months, even if it's a month, they won't be able to survive. When the new lord arrives, it is estimated that it will be difficult to collect their corpses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing everyone crying and crying, Tom, who lost points in front of Hudson just now, hurriedly stepped forward and reprimanded: \"The benevolent Master Hudson has told you, why don't you hurry up and get out of the way!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was because of the flashing sword, or perhaps because of the natural fear of the nobles, the terrified crowd led the two old men who passed out, and silently moved out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Certainly not the remnants of the rebels, the benevolent Master Hudson also came up with sympathy, and said generously: \"For the sake of your loyalty to Viscount Alphonse, I will not care about you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom, leave them a pound of bread each. Whether you can survive or not depends on your good fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's all, who makes me kind! If you want to follow and leave, just follow behind the convoy! As long as you come to my territory alive, I will take you in as citizens. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, Hudson got into the carriage without looking back. A nobleman must look like a nobleman, and playing courteous corporals to serfs will only frighten them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they want to win over this group of low-quality labor, the aristocratic attitude of the nobles still needs to be grasped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving the right to choose to these refugees, even if it spreads out, people will only say that he is kind, instead of spraying him for robbing other people's territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people were all refugees and fled from the famine. Even if the new lord arrives, it is not easy to entangle in this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting in the carriage again, Hudson's thinking became active again. The war caused a significant reduction in the population of the two counties, but in the end there were still lucky people who recovered their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that the local aristocrats can't be touched doesn't mean that the outsiders can't move either. As long as he fools people over, he will be his leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are very few young and strong men inside, most of them are women and children, but they are still laborers after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mining is indeed a bit difficult, but it is not a big problem to follow the fire to cook and farm the bastard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially women of the right age among them can also marry bachelors in their own army to stabilize the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making a decision, Hudson immediately summoned his knight servants and assigned the task of fooling people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of technical work can only be done by the group of teenagers who have studied with him for a few months. The remaining big soldiers are basically boring gourds. It's okay to let them go into battle to kill the enemy, but it's too embarrassing to inspire people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all karma planted by Hudson himself. Before setting off, for the convenience of command, a group of simple and honest soldiers were specially selected from the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, this group really did well. Hudson is what he says, and he doesn't have many ideas of his own, so it's easy to manage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The general environment is like this, and the serf soldiers who joined the group later were also affected. Especially after Hudson fiddled with the continuous sitting system and cut off a few uneasy guys to stand up, those who had ideas had no ideas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I've been busy fighting the war, so I don't have time to think about it. So much so that now, Hudson realizes the lack of talent in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poaching?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this thought arose, he was decisively suppressed it. Those who can dig are not capable, and those who are capable cannot afford to dig people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only Hudson who lacks talents, but almost all minor nobles are facing the problem of lack of talents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowledge is highly monopolized, leading to the concentration of talents in the upper class. Everyone is aristocrat, how could they be moved by three melons and two dates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ask the tribe for help?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it, as an adult, you should know that there is no free lunch in the world. Brothers have to settle accounts clearly, let alone clansmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two unlucky children in White County are an example. How much help they get now from various sources, and how much debt of favor they will have to pay in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if their generation is not up to the mark, when the next generation grows up, they have to continue to pay back. In case of an accident, it will be paid by their successors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among other things, the kingdom encourages the responsibility of guarding the land, and takes care of the nobles who died in battle. The purposely increased exchange quota for life essence is estimated to have been paid out as wages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are comings and goings, giving and returning are equal, and it is also one of the important reasons why the loose Koslow family can maintain centripetal force for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to be in debt for favors, then don't ask for help easily, or you will have no friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Great nobles can also make cakes for their subordinates, but Hudson is not even qualified to paint cakes. If you can't give people what they want most, you can only rely on krypton gold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the money is in place, there will still be talents. Among the free people living in big cities, there are also some talents who are willing to accept employment for money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the talents recruited by Krypton Gold usually only follow part-time jobs, but they will leave whenever there is a better opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, for the sake of profit, there are not a few who betray the original owner, and their loyalty is really worrying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an early entrepreneur, Hudson feels that loyalty is more important than ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being betrayed by his subordinates in the peaceful world of his previous life would at most lose a little money; being betrayed by his subordinates in the continent of Aslante would cost his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until he has the ability to resist risks, Hudson is not ready to take risks. If there are no talents available, then cultivate them slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, my territory is only a barony, and it is still the most primitive feudal rule. There are not so many messy things, and I can be busy with a little work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under Hudson's deliberate manipulation, the change of power at the top quickly spread among the refugee circles. It's just that in the details, there have been so many changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the nobles from the north came to take office, but they became the new lords and took them to the northern border to be neighbors with cruel orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the long-term propaganda of the Alpha Kingdom, in the minds of ordinary people, orcs are creatures more terrifying than devils, and people are panicked for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever this time, there will be clever \"refugees\" who propose to leave the territory to join a benevolent lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the whole family of the old lord died, and the new lord has not yet accepted their allegiance, so leaving is not considered a betrayal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speeding convoy quickly attracted refugees along the way. For no other reason than good Lord Hudson's rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every day when the meal time comes, the food is distributed on time. Although they could barely eat seven or eight percent full, that was enough to make them determined to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if you add teenagers who are 14 to 15 and middle-aged men under 40, it is only less than 800.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the rest are old and weak women and children who are in relatively good health. The weak ones were either eliminated in the previous famine, or fell halfway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the definition of \"old\" is the standard of the Aslant Continent. After the age of thirty is considered middle-aged, and in the forties is considered an old man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to live to be one hundred and eighty years old, you can only live in a noble family. Serfs with poor living conditions, those who can live beyond the age of sixty, are comparable to the scales of a giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of disasters, human beings are vulnerable. Even if Hudson deliberately slowed down, many people still failed to keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to save so many people is already considered good. If Hudson didn't intervene and waited for the new lord to arrive, I'm afraid not even half of these people would survive in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Settling down is very simple, as long as a piece of land is divided, the serfs will build houses by themselves. Everyone is very conscious, such a trivial matter, does not need Master Hudson to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief inspection, Hudson planned five settlements around the mine, centering on it. Basically, it was the original site, and if the refugees were divided, it would be considered a success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a price, the food and grass were reduced by 40 carts. This is still the result of deliberate restrictions. If you eat with an open belly, I am afraid that the consumption will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing to say, and people have to continue to send people back to Dadir City to transport food. Otherwise, the food in hand alone would only last for twenty days at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 3,000 mouths, no matter how economical you are, you have to consume at least two to three thousand pounds of food every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to travel, and there is no heavy labor. It is enough for ordinary serfs to have a full meal. If there is not enough food, wild vegetables, leaves, and grass roots are used to make up, but soldiers cannot go hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The veterans who have finally accumulated, Hudson does not want to destroy them again because of malnutrition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, as a hero, you must be given some preferential treatment, right? There is no money for the military salary. If you don't even care about your food, who will work for Master Hudson in the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he had harvested a lot of food in the war before, Hudson still felt the pressure to supply so many mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little calculation, he realized that with the food in his hand, according to the current way of eating, he could last at most two or three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, most of the food was stored in Dardir City, and a family knight was hired to help look after it. It would be a hassle to transport it over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by the number of carriages, at least two trips have to be made. Although the war is over, there are not a few mountain kings who have fallen into the grass. For the sake of safety, it is still indispensable to send military escorts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The order will go on, and the ration rationing system will be implemented in the territory in the future, and the daily standards must be strictly followed. Jill, you are responsible for the daily food distribution, and I will conduct spot checks from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specific standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldier: 1.5 pounds of wild vegetable rye bread per day, 1 pound of oats, beans and miscellaneous grains per day, 0.5 pounds of salt per month, 2 pounds of meat per month, some wild or dried vegetable soup. (Remarks: 1 pound is about 1 catty, the grain will expand when cooked, it is not equal to the raw grain)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the level of the officer, on the basis of the soldier, each level increases by 15%, and wild vegetables can not be added to the bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young and strong over sixteen years old: 0.8 lbs of poor-quality rye bread per day, half a pound of oats, beans, and miscellaneous grains per day, 0.3 lbs of salt per month, 0.5 lbs of meat per month, and some vegetable soup.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Healthy women, teenagers over ten years old, and middle-aged men will all be distributed according to 80% of the ration standard for young and strong; the rest of the old and weak women and children will be distributed according to 70% of the ration standard for young and strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food for the army was distributed to the centurions for unified production, and the rations for the serfs were distributed to the families. Thirty soldiers were stationed at each assembly point to maintain order, and those who violated order were reduced to slaves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standard cannot be lowered. In the era when there is no oil in the stomach, everyone is a big eater. Everyone eats a lot and gets hungry quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before formulating the standard, Hudson did in-depth research. The same is rye bread, and it is also divided into grades and grades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best is naturally whole wheat bread; followed by rye bread with wild vegetables, usually with wild vegetables ranging from 10% to 30%, and the taste is barely passable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Again, it is rye bread with wild vegetables and leaves, generally adding 30% to 50% of it, and black-hearted ones can even add sawdust, bark, and sand to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commonly known as poor-quality bread, there is only one principle that can't kill people. It can be used as a weapon in the hand, and it can hurt your feet if you drop it on the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is naturally not so unscrupulous, wood chips, bark, sand and the like will definitely not be added, but wild vegetables and leaves are indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out by lack of food. Only by implementing this low standard can the food in hand last for three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is only a theoretical state. Now the low standard can be implemented because the serfs did not engage in high-intensity labor and did not consume a lot of energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once production starts to resume, food consumption will increase dramatically. Miners must be full, otherwise they will not have the strength to work. Women and children who cultivate the land also cannot go hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, sir!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jill replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no objection from anyone, they are all cronies who are following Master Hudson, so just follow the command. Anyway, as long as you don't get hungry, it doesn't matter what the standard is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Baron Redman promised to send their family members here, that will happen in the coming year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't settle the territory well, build up the infrastructure, and send people over in advance, that's adding to the chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a pause, Hudson suddenly remembered his livestock. Although many heroes were rewarded and banquets were held in Dadir City, many were slaughtered, but many were left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the war horses are relatively expensive, except for keeping eight for his own use, the rest were traded by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including in Dardir City, the family knight who helped take care of the food and grass was hired by Hudson at a high price for a war horse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way to the territory, three sheep were unfortunately injured, and Hudson could only relieve them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Up to now, there are still twenty-eight cows, one hundred and sixty-seven sheep, and one hundred and eighty-seven poor horses left among the captured animals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naive horse was able to escape the catastrophe. In addition to being able to pull the cart, the most important thing was that the meat was not tasty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slaughter can no longer be continued. Most of the remaining cattle and sheep are females, and they still have to keep their cubs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it was the cubs who were able to keep so many cattle and sheep. Under the concept that meat can be eaten less and milk cannot be cut off, the cub successfully rescued his own milk source from Hudson's butcher knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Volunteering to lower food standards is not because Hudson has broken his promise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, the food standard of the cub has been reduced from one sheep and 30 pounds of beef per day to the equivalent of meat and Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Earth Bear is an omnivorous monster, not to mention whole grains, even if it eats bamboo and leaves, it can live well. If you raise a dragon with a bigger appetite, it is estimated that Hudson will be bankrupt just by eating it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tom, you are in charge of organizing the young and strong to build the animal shed. The action must be fast, and it must be completed before the rainy season.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the serfs who have experience in raising livestock sign up, take care of the livestock, and increase the ration ratio to 80% of the soldiers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Animals are more valuable than people, this is not a joke. Needless to say, the war horse, the price of that thing has never been high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beef is second only to Warcraft meat in the banquet, and the price is not low either. Depending on the variety and weight, basically three to seven gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because the Alpha Kingdom is not popular with cattle farming, and prefers to use horses to plow the land, otherwise the price of cattle will go further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of a strong adult man in the slave market is only five to six gold coins, which is less than that of a top-quality cow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price for children is only about one-third of that of adult men. The old and the weak are even less valuable, and basically no one cares about them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The price of a woman is very magical. It mainly depends on her beauty and talent. The cheap ones can be bought with two or three gold coins, and the expensive ones have even been sold for thousands of gold coins at auctions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there are exceptions for special status blessings. For example: Elf girls basically start with four digits, and five digits are the norm, and higher numbers are not impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Special races among orcs can often be sold at high prices, but they are not as exaggerated as elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that things are rare and valuable, and the elves are not easy to mess with, and they live together in the elf forest, and the slaves will pay for their lives if they are not caught.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In comparison, orcs are easier to capture. Earl Pierce has a team of orc fox girls, cat girls... a dancer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harm is mutual, and the orcs often harass the northern border. Human slave hunting teams also often go deep into the orc kingdom to capture some special races with high prices to serve as slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a big mine owner, he is destined to deal with slaves. Especially in the case of insufficient labor force, slaves are the main force of mining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Hudson didn't disband the army, he knew that he had made up his mind to be an unscrupulous mine owner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, just hand over the livestock to them for management. If something happens, it will be a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about we let the soldiers who are in charge of taking care of the animals first keep an eye on them, and if they take good care of them, we will hand them over completely. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tom suggested slightly nervously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, the status gap between nobles and serfs is so large that it is almost an unbridgeable gap forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the nobles have always given orders, and the serfs are responsible for carrying them out. It has never been the serfs' turn to object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Hudson who often encouraged them to put forward their opinions, even if they were wrong, they would not be punished. Tom really didn't dare to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You really should be careful, just do as you say.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's rare to have someone under his command who is willing to use his brains, and the suggestions he put forward are passable. At this time, it is natural to encourage them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Have a certain foundation, and have encountered so many difficulties when starting a business and innovating. If he started from nothing, Hudson doubted very much that he would die halfway before stepping out of Novice Village.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if such a house is completed, Master Hudson will not live in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After inspecting several houses in a row, a similar smell appeared. It was so unlucky that Hudson directly gave up the idea of ​​picking up ready-made.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Noble castle, as the face of a nobleman, this must be arranged. It is a pity that the distant water cannot quench the near thirst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the construction of a castle often takes several years, or even decades to complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either build a wooden house and make do with it, or continue to live in tents. There is no doubt that Hudson chose the former.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military tent in his hand has too little space. When marching and fighting, it's okay to make do with it; if it's used as a daily residence, it's too aggrieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weather in summer is like a big stove, and the stuffy tent is like a big steamer. Hudson, who doesn't want to be reduced to Xiaolongbao, is another night of \"heaven is quilt, status seat\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first night of officially staying in the territory is still very memorable. It's a pity that I don't have the Philosopher's Stone in my hand to record it, otherwise it would be the best material to encourage the younger generation to \"difficult to start a business\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the stars in the sky, Hudson was full of emotions. Fortunately, God is enough to save face. The weather has been clear and clear since the start of the expedition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heat is a little hotter, but that's better than the downpour. If it's really in the rainy season, the muddy road can break people down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the weather this year is still somewhat abnormal. In the southeastern province, where there is plenty of rain, in the past two months, Wyton and Wright counties have not received any rain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in other areas of the Kingdom, Hudson does not know. But if this situation continues, drought in Wrighton and Wright counties is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crops in the field seem to be overthinking. This year's talk about crops in the two counties is pure nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The spring plowing has been sown, but when the rebels led by the Skull and Bones move, the nobles and gentlemen caught off guard rush to the street one after another. Who cares about the crops?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the unattended fields, the weeds grow much better than the wheat seedlings, and the harvest can be a tenth or two, which is considered the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the territory of Hudson, the tree species that fell with the wind have already taken root in the field. If they come over in the evening for a few months, they will return the farmland to forests directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it this way, it seems that the drought is not so terrible. As long as the tributary of the Nucang River passing through his own territory does not dry up, everything will be a small problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the province of Felix in the Northland, in a super luxurious mansion, facing the resentful eyes of his lover, Grand Duke Kavadia was also scalp numb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Chaos in the private lives of noble circles has never been anything new. As long as no one is killed, everything is fine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Cavadia also thought so. As a well-known romantic figure in the Northland, he was full of lovers when he was young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can often walk by the river, how can you not get your shoes wet. At a banquet, Grand Duke Kavadia hooked up with the noble lady in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, it should be a noble lady. At that time, Mrs. Linna in front of her was still before Yunying was married.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, this was nothing, it was just a one-night affair, do you still want to be responsible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference in identity means that the two of them will not have any results. Even if Kavadia is the ultimate good man, he has to honestly go back and accept the family marriage instead of playing free love.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The amazing thing is that the young Miss Linna has no experience, and Kavadia's hit rate is too high, so she actually got pregnant after a one-night stand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid a scandal, and couldn't bear to dispose of the child, under the arrangement of Kavadia, Miss Linna quickly found a foreign knight to be her successor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long after the marriage, the unlucky knight died in battle, and the widowed Mrs. Linna raised the child alone, everything was so logical.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The parties involved are all dead, and the date of birth of the child is wrong, so naturally no one will go to investigate without opening their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the care of Grand Duke Kavadia, the flies and mosquitoes who didn't open their eyes were all killed. No matter how shameless other people are in their hearts, no one will say it on the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The life of the mother and son can be regarded as going on. It's just that with the introduction of the duchess and the birth of the first son, there is still nothing to contain the fire in the paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such things as illegitimate children are very common in the aristocratic circle. Even if it was worn, Grand Duke Kavadia did not hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't admit it, it doesn't exist. Anyone who dares to babble, first check if his neck is hard enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the child grows up, the situation gradually changes. Just because ordinary people dare not do things does not mean that no one dares to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's a coincidence or someone's plan. By chance, Grand Duke Kavadia's legitimate son and illegitimate son collided together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of an elf slave girl, two young and energetic teenagers had a fight on the street.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Needless to say, the result is that the illegitimate child bumped into the legitimate son, and it is an inevitable result that he will suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counterattacking the superior, that only exists in novel picture books. I have never heard of it in the continent of Aslant, and there is an illegitimate child who succeeds in the position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The law of succession is not a display, and an illegitimate child who is not seen in the light is not within the category of heirs at all. Even if he is very popular with his father, he can at most inherit some property, without even thinking about the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the illegitimate child's apparent identity also has the right of inheritance, there is no possibility of any counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing, even if it really happened, is rarely exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Messing around in one's own family is a shocking scandal, and a family will fall apart if it is not handled well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Kavadia is obviously a smart person. Even if he arranges to take over the man, he chooses an outsider with no foundation and does not mess around in the local area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The project was very successful in the early stage. Under the arrangement of his good father, the adult Sith successfully entered the army and gained a series of military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything was fine at first, but unfortunately, with a conflict between the legitimate son and the illegitimate son, the embarrassing situation of Linna mother and son became even more embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The palms of the hands and the backs of the hands are full of flesh, and it is wrong to stand on either side, and Grand Duke Kavadia is also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been dragged on for ten years by means of peace and mud. Although there is no conflict between the two sides on the surface, the contradiction has accumulated deeper and deeper as time goes by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact was Sith's marriage, which was delayed. With the reputation of having an illegitimate child, no noble of a higher class would choose such a partner for marriage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the little nobles wanted to flatter the Grand Duke, they were also unwilling to offend the future Grand Duke, and avoided such things like tigers. What's more, if the conditions are too poor, Linna and her son don't like it either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the arrangement of Grand Duke Kavadia, the Sith knights who had accumulated a lot of military exploits quickly advanced all the way and won the title of Viscount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, you can have titles, but don't even think about territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land in the northern border is basically monopolized by the five major families. It is not difficult for Grand Duke Kavadia to arrange a fiefdom for his son. The trouble is that the status of the illegitimate child of Sith cannot be recognized by the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to forcefully arrange fiefdoms. It's just that you have to be prepared to lose your son in a certain orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The feudal nobles are responsible for guarding the land, and they cannot run away. If you can't win, you have to stand firm. As long as the reinforcements are a little bit slower, it will be your fate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original small and medium-sized nobles in northern Xinjiang were all killed one after another in this way, and finally formed a pattern of five major families jointly dominating northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop crying, Lena!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he is not a fickle person, Kavadia stretched out his arms to hug his lover and comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Northern Xinjiang is not a good place. The Felix family seems to be extremely prominent, but it is actually a raging fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few years, although there have been constant wars in the Northland, they were all small fights. If you encounter a full-scale invasion of orcs, you will know that the five major families in northern Xinjiang are nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many years of peace, it is estimated that the time before the next large-scale invasion of the orcs will not be too far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, letting Sith jump out of the cage is also a good thing. Although the title is a little lower and the fiefdom is a little smaller, the southeast province is fertile and has no threat from foreign enemies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you work hard, a barony in the south may not be worse than a viscount in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The titles are all fictitious, and the world still has to use strength to speak. Don't be blinded by illusory things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five dukes of Northern Xinjiang sound really majestic. But if I had a choice, I would rather be the 12th Earl of the Kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the truth. On the surface, the five dukes of northern Xinjiang have the largest land area, the highest title, and the strongest strength, far surpassing the nobles in other areas of the kingdom. In fact, they are suffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the orc as a good neighbor, they live in fear every day. I am afraid that one day the war will break out and everything that is currently in business will be ruined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, the ancestors chased away the nobles of the small and medium-sized fiefdoms of the Northern Territory, regardless of their appearance, in essence to strengthen their own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although judging from the current situation, it is indeed a mistake, but that is also a manifestation of being prepared for danger in times of peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no medicine for regret in the world. With the departure of small and medium-sized fiefdom nobles, the five major families have obtained large tracts of land. Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more difficult to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Castles once stood criss-cross across the land of Northern Xinjiang. In order to defend their homes, the nobles had always fought **** battles to the end, even the orcs were afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different now. Although the castle was preserved, the nobles who were responsible for the defense changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, they were working hard for themselves, and everyone was fighting with their lives. Now that it has become a job for the five major families, it is too much for granted to want to buy everyone's life with just such a small military salary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fight if you can win, and run if you can't win. Desperation did happen, but it was only under unavoidable circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcing everyone to fight to the death, the five major families have tried. It's just that the final result was so touching that people simply stopped coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, there was no other way, the five major families could only choose to compromise. While working hard to change their own image; on the other hand, offering better conditions to lure nobles from other regions of the kingdom to join the battlefield in the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the consideration of the overall situation, the other major forces in the kingdom did not want the defense line in the northern border to collapse, and provided them with a lot of support, which gradually stabilized the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What you said sounds good! If you really go to the south and don't know the place, how do you let Sith gain a foothold there?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, there are not a few small and medium nobles who have been tossed into decline by you in the past two hundred years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all of these people died, and many families slowly revived after they went south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although time has passed, the hatred has not dissipated. Once you let them know that Sith is your son, I'm afraid when the time comes...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mrs. Linna, who didn't buy it, directly exposed the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bane planted by the ancestors, Kavadia is also very helpless. It's not that the Felix family has never thought about cutting grass and roots, but the problem is that a family of nobles in the world can affect the whole body.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, what happened back then made them notorious and were rejected by the kingdom's aristocratic circle. If you continue to do things to the extreme, you will become a public enemy of the nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It's just that everyone is not as extravagant as Grand Duke Kavadia, and illegitimate children can be arranged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the existence of relying on the five major families to make a living, the resources on hand are not so abundant. Most of the resources of the sub-family are left to the children of the direct line, or the children of the collateral line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a family with a small population, it is difficult for an illegitimate child who is not recognized to get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, there are still too many monks and too little porridge. Originally, there was not much land left for them, and the local family had to share a share, and the knights who came from other places to work hard had to leave a share for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are lessons learned with blood. The big aristocrats above dare to eat alone, and the small aristocrats below dare to show bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family foundation is not in the northern border. For these people, the war is just a step of promotion, blocking their way forward, so don't blame them for paddling on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying a heavy price, the nobles in northern Xinjiang have all learned their lesson. On the issue of the distribution of military exploits, it has basically achieved fairness and fairness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Established a system for everyone to share the results of the battle, and the defense line in northern Xinjiang was considered stable, forming the current political structure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, even if everyone wanted to go south, they were not so eager. However, in recent years, the orc empire has undergone changes. The mild-tempered old emperor passed away, and the new king who succeeded him was a strong main fighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there was no immediate invasion, there were quite a few small tentative moves. The Prophet of Spring River Plumbing Duck, the veteran nobles who sensed the danger, immediately realized that eggs cannot be put in one basket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was a reshuffle in the southeastern province, and everyone immediately realized the opportunity. All the nobles in northern Xinjiang joined forces to exert pressure and forcefully seized food from the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the risks involved, it's not that they boast. The nobles who are also martial arts, the northern Xinjiang nobles who compete with orcs in friendly matches every day, their combat effectiveness is far from that of the southern nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the elite soldiers of hundreds of battles to the south, everyone is very confident in gaining a firm foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor's Mansion in Beda City, all the officials of the southeastern province gathered together are waiting cautiously in the meeting hall at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss is in a bad mood, so the younger brother will not be in a good mood either. It is also a shame for their followers that the Dalton family was eaten by tigers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the people present were not the retainers of Earl Pierce, as a member of the nobles of the southeastern province, everyone also did not like the nobles of northern Xinjiang who went south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by interests. Originally, the meat was divided among the people in the pot. Although everyone had disputes, they still discussed it on the whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce did play too far before, but it was just an accident. Afterwards, he made amends to the victims, and offered benefits to appease the nobles in the province. Overall, he still paid attention to his appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different for outsiders who **** food from the mouth of a tiger. How can it not make people angry when they **** the most delicious meat in the pot as soon as they come up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you look carefully at the map, you will find that the territories of a group of northern nobles are connected together, and the transportation points and cities in the two counties of Wyton and Wright have all fallen into their control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing more than a harmonious relationship. If the two sides turn their faces, a group of local nobles will be controlled by others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the gloomy-faced Earl Pierce enter, the atmosphere in the hall became more solemn, and for a while, only the sound of breathing could be heard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, take your seats!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You should understand why I invited you here today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that they just wanted to take a share of the pie. Although it was a little difficult to accept, it was worth making a little sacrifice for the sake of the overall situation of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But some people just don't know how to be satisfied, and always want to take more. Fortunately, His Majesty the King is wise and rejected their unreasonable demands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these guys still don't know how to be satisfied. Unable to obtain the support of His Majesty the King, he attempted to take it by force with his own strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You say this kind of thing, can we agree? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Earl Pierce's inspiring words, everyone immediately realized that things had changed. Reminiscent of the fact that the Governor's Mansion hastily finalized the fief matters, everyone instantly understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It must be that the guys in Beijiang did something again, which stimulated the Earl. As a last resort, he played a quick knife to cut the mess, which directly caused the established facts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you know it, you know it. In the recent enfeoffment, everyone present has vested interests. Even if the family doesn't get meat, relatives get it too. Naturally, the meat in the mouth cannot be spit out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone answered one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The anger of the crowd seems to be devouring people. Seeing this scene, Earl Pierce waved his hand in satisfaction, motioning for everyone to be quiet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since everyone thinks so, I'm relieved. They can break the rules, so we don't have to be polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The maps of the two counties are here. Originally, I thought to wait for all the nobles to arrive before finalizing the territory of each fiefdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it seems that kindness is in vain, and people don't appreciate it at all. Without saying hello, we directly led a large private army southward, making us seem to be afraid of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply don't wait, everyone has worked hard recently and went to Wright and Wyton counties to finalize the fief territories of each family in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one principle, and it must abide by the laws and regulations of the kingdom, and no one can pick faults in terms of procedure and territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is absolutely necessary, don't create a bunch of enclaves. Otherwise, everyone's fiefdoms will be difficult to manage in the future, which will easily lead to conflicts. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The naked hint, everyone instantly understood that this was the menacing attack of the nobles in northern Xinjiang, which made the Dalton family feel threatened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Earl Pierce was also very helpless. Unlike the southern aristocrats who farmed with peace of mind, the main income of the northern aristocrats came from smuggling, supplemented by land output, kingdom subsidies, and slave hunting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    is engaged in high-risk business, and military violence is inevitable. Although the economic situation is not as good as that of the southern nobles, the military power in their hands is even better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the configuration of the nobles who went south, you can see that the private army ranges from one to two hundred to as many as three to five hundred. There is even an illegitimate son of a duke who actually brought an army of more than 800 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The private army of a single noble is inconspicuous, but the number of all the northern nobles who went south is astonishing. According to the intelligence collected by the spies, the opponent's total strength is no less than 4,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to survive on the battlefield of fighting orcs is obviously beyond the reach of ordinary serf soldiers. Even if they can't keep up with the top troops like the Crimson Knights, they can still be classified among the elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The aristocrats were enshrined, and they did not bring a lot of money to build, but they brought a large number of troops. Their motives had to be doubted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once these guys get a firm foothold, this nail will not be easy to pull out. In the unlikely event that the future situation changes, it is not impossible for people to turn their backs on customers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to have a direct confrontation with the Northern Xinjiang faction, but also want to pull out this nail, you can only encourage the younger brothers to go up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a master at playing politics, Earl Pierce knows very well that it is very difficult for everyone to work hard to sow discord with empty teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone dislikes this group of outsiders, it is not a reason for the two sides to confront each other. In this context, it is very necessary to dig pits and mines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the jurisprudence does not care about favors. In order to reduce unnecessary conflicts, and for the long-term peace and stability of Wright and Wyton counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In my opinion, the specific division of fiefdoms should fully respect the wishes of the lords themselves. As long as the demand can be satisfied within the scope of the rules, it should be satisfied as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't satisfy everyone, then try to satisfy the majority of people. This is also in line with the Kingdom's principle of fairness. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sensing that it was profitable, the political officer on the side, Viscount Leonard, followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is self-evident who is the majority and who is the minority. The Dalton family is afraid of the strong dragon from the northern border, and the local nobles are even more afraid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the nobles in the southeast province, except for the Dalton family who can produce several thousand elites, there are only a handful of the remaining families who can gather an elite infantry regiment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that the southward movement of the nobles in the North is forcing everyone to run wildly on the road of military expansion. If you don't want to be eliminated in the future competition, you can only join the competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

A group of lifeless refugees also had rare smiles on their faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People are not afraid of suffering, but they are afraid of not seeing hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lord is the backbone of everyone. Since childhood, he has been accustomed to living a life of being dependent on the noble lords. It is really embarrassing for them to be independent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is to be robbed first by the rebels, and then by the counter-insurgency army, and suffered the cruelest social beatings, which caused everyone to feel seriously insecure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including following Hudson all the way south, eating and not working every day, everyone still has no idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's different now. With new jobs comes value. Don't worry about the Lord Lord suddenly abandoning them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't know what the serfs thought. The busy construction site is essentially just doing one thing, repairing the infrastructure damaged by the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, a group of refugees have come outside. It is said that they are miners from the mining area and their families. They want to come and join you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the good news, Hudson once thought that his arrogance broke out. Even without sending troops, some people took the initiative to join them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing the person clearly, this feeling disappeared. Where are the miners, they are clearly a group of beggars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All of them were sallow and emaciated, dressed in ragged clothes, trembling when they walked, and looked starved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is an aristocrat, Hudson still did not break away from the people at the bottom, saying \"why not eat minced meat\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are nearly a thousand people in the team, and there are many old and weak women and children in it. It is a miracle that they can survive in the mountains and forests. It is impossible to live well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the territory is rich in output and there are many wild animals in the jungle, hunting can make up for the lack of food, that is just a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be possible to hunt thousands of catties of meat at a time, but it is purely dreaming to hunt hundreds of catties of meat every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If hunting could not guarantee a stable supply of meat, Hudson would not set his quota so low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My stomach is so hungry that I can't stand it, no wonder I have to run to join the new lord. If Hudson came ten days and a half months later, it is estimated that there will be a tragedy of cannibalism here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that point, this group of miners is basically useless. People's bottom line has always been very low, as long as they break through the first time, there will be countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at everyone, Hudson announced the result directly to everyone without any extra nonsense:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Viscount Alphonse died unfortunately. I am your new lord, Baron Hudson-Coslow, and now I declare to accept your allegiance!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After accepting the prostration gift from everyone, the relationship between the lord and the people is considered to be established. In the years to come, everyone will fulfill their obligations and enjoy their rights and interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The simple ceremony is over, and everyone is considered their own. Hudson was not polite, and directly arranged for his men to take the newcomers to the river to wash their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules of the game are like this. When the old lord dies, the new lord only needs to declare that he accepts the allegiance of the subjects, and the matter is over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opinions of the serfs, that is, there is no opinion. Part of the estate itself, who cares what they think?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is taken for granted, without the slightest discomfort. Forcibly \"adding drama\" to buy people's hearts will only make things worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not joking. In history, there have been lords who were suspected of being counterfeit by serfs because they were too close to the people. Because the lord in their memory has always been aloof.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With more people and more power, the repair speed of the territorial infrastructure is accelerated, and the corresponding food consumption is also increasing day by day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson divided his troops to transport the remaining grain from Dadil City; at the same time, he wrote letters non-stop to buy grain from nearby nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two counties of Wyton and Wright are almost at a loss, and the rise in food prices in the southeastern provinces is a high probability event. Even if there is no food shortage in the province, food prices will rise due to political needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this three-acre land in the southeastern province, the grain merchants nominally determine the price of grain, but in fact the masters behind the scenes are the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on Hudson's understanding of Earl Pierce, if this political strongman doesn't take advantage of the opportunity in exchange for benefits, he will be worthy of the nickname \"Lion of Flame\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not because Earl Pierce has a conscience that he is not raising food prices. Mainly the local nobles, who doesn't have any food reserves?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the normal development process, relying on the support of the family, we can survive the panic in the early stage of entrepreneurship. The price is skyrocketing, but it can't help people have food in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is an exception. With the group of miners in front of him, the population of the territory has directly exceeded the 4,000 mark. This is not the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cronies sent out to fool people are still working hard. He didn't know how many people he could fool in the end, so he could only reserve more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is still very clear in terms of thinking, and while he can buy food now, he will buy more. As for the aid promised by my father, I can put it there first, and then send someone to pick it up when needed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within two hundred miles, all the nobles who did not participate in the development of the territory received Hudson's grain purchase letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The owner bought 80,000 pounds, and the west ordered 100,000 pounds. As long as someone is willing to sell, no matter if it is rye, oats, barley, or potatoes, broad beans, peas, carrots, pumpkins... He will not refuse .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for more high-end Warcraft meat, beef and mutton, wheat, spices and other daily necessities, they are all out of the scope of purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is caused by the price, and it is also grain. The price of wheat is 1.5 times higher than that of rye, and nearly twice higher than that of oats and beans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like countless lords, cheap and large quantity is the first consideration. The cheapest potatoes cost only one and a half coppers a pound; rye only three coppers a pound...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (1 gold coin = 15 silver coins = 1500 copper coins)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only expensive food purchased in large quantities is table salt, up to thirty copper coins per pound. This is the low-quality table salt eaten by serfs, and the refined salt enjoyed by nobles, and the price has soared to two hundred copper coins per pound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that this was extortion, Hudson could only grit his teeth and accept it. Who let the production of salt be in the hands of the great nobles?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buying, buying, buying, it was a waste of money for a while. Although due to time and distance, these transactions are still only on paper, but the money still has to be reserved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a tragedy if someone delivers the goods to the door but has no money to pay the bill. For nobles, it is very shameful to owe money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordered more than 3 million pounds of supplies from the neighbors in one go. If all of them can be sold, the budget of 7,000 gold coins will be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not Hudson's style to sit and eat. Thinking of his pocket that was about to bottom out, the reality told him that he must find a way to make money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
    "Chapter 74": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <h1 class=\"main-title\">\n  The King Chapter 74: falsehood\n </h1>\n <body>\n  <div [class]=\"'par fontsize-' + fontsize\" class=\"par fontsize-16\">\n   <p>\n    Chapter 74\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With food on hand and mines at home, I don't panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current cleaning speed, production can resume as soon as next month. It is a pity that there are fewer young and strong labor forces in the territory, and it is difficult to increase production capacity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thick blue smoke rose and fell into Hudson's eyes, which was particularly pleasing to the eye. This is a necessary prerequisite to resume mine production, making charcoal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw the miners skillfully put the cut wood into the charcoal kiln in an orderly manner, covered it with soil to leave an opening for ignition, and then poured the burning charcoal into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two workers next to them, fanning the wind with huge zong leaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that in the era of existing productivity, the charcoal production process has matured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The air supply method is primitive, that's because it used magic technology, a device similar to a blower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the war, it was destroyed, and a substitute could not be found for a while, which directly caused the air supply mode to return to the original era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magic technology is useless, and it will not be available for a while. Hudson could only choose the next best thing and replace it with a bellows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has explained the process of the manual bellows, and arranged for people to make it. However, the process is not yet mature, and the practicability of the product needs to be improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, it will be difficult for mines to use magical black technology for a long time in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything comes from cost. Compared with expensive magic devices, labor is really too cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Installing one alchemy version of the blower is enough to buy ten young and strong slaves. The most pitiful thing is that this thing still needs magic spar to drive, but what Hudson lacks most is magic spar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as the baron's quota is concerned, it's not enough to provide for his own cultivation, so how can it be wasted here?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lower the efficiency, the lower it is. Anyway, the labor cost is cheap enough, and it can be economically cheaper to use human bellows instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without time for further planning, Hudson received news from the family that the officials who demarcated the border had already set off and would arrive in Wright County soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First of all, I don't know where to start, and I'm not sure when I will arrive in my own territory. The only thing I can do is to stay at home honestly and don't run around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case someone comes and the owner is not at home, it will be a lot of fun. With the bureaucratic style of the governor's mansion, they will not wait for the master to come back. If the owner is not at home, they can do the work on the map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the parties concerned, whether they are satisfied with the result has never been in their consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have a strong network, you can also find the relationship and re-divide it again. Those who have no connections, no background, and no strength can only admit to themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Hudson is not a member of the Sanwu, he is not so awesome. There is indeed some background in personal connections, but it is not enough for people from the Governor's Mansion to go alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for strength, it is purely a business blow. Hudson was able to start the name of \"Knight of the Bow\", mainly due to the hard publicity of his teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to realize his military achievements, his achievements are exaggerated as much as possible. Especially in the battle of annihilating the cavalry of the Holy See, which obviously killed 500 people, it was blown up to 3,000 by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be too exaggerated, but no one believes it. In the end, they gave a supplementary explanation: wipe out 1,000 elite cavalry of the Holy See and 2,000 main rebels.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called \"use of soldiers like gods\" is purely based on the fact that the command ability of the rebel army is too useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he is as awesome as the rumors say, then he stomps on Hudson, and the southeast province will tremble three times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the southeastern province where the Dalton family is in charge does not allow such a powerful creature to exist. Once it appears, it is either incorporated or strangled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that Hudson can still live such a carefree life is enough to prove how watery the rumors are. It's okay to scare the middle and small nobles, but it can't scare the people in the Governor's Mansion at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Sikorari, Uncle Baggins, Uncle Xiludi...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A series of uncles called down, and Hudson's scalp was a little numb. He didn't think it was a coincidence that the people who came to preside over the division of fiefs were all friends of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either the Governor's Office is engaged in fishing law enforcement; or the Governor's Office deliberately creates opportunities for them to favoritism in the division of fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little thought, Hudson quickly made a judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fishing law enforcement is not like that. As a privileged nobleman, it is not a serious crime at all to just favoritism in the division of fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most serious consequence is nothing more than resigning from office and redrawing the boundary line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are more cautious and leave no obvious loopholes in the procedure, you won't even be punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the brain is flooded, no one will spend so much effort on the layout, just to get a punishment that is neither painful nor itchy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is the latter, it is estimated that the future of the two counties of Wright and Wyton may not be peaceful. Neighbors are prone to conflicts, and there is a governor who concentrates on digging holes and laying mines, so it is no wonder that there are no disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The welcome banquet was very shabby. Although Hudson tried his best, the food in the territory was too simple, and even the banquet was placed in the open air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, the mining area is too remote, and it is not valued by the previous lord at all, and there are no decent buildings nearby.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few stone houses are still stacked with food and pig iron, which are not worthy of the status of nobility at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, those who come here are considered \"our own people\", otherwise they would have to be put on little shoes just for this treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were old acquaintances who had dealt with each other before. After a few glasses of wine, everyone let go more and more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, your territory is too remote, why don't you choose a rich and big town?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sikolari asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is also the question of many people in the aristocratic circle. Everyone has only two impressions of the Salam Mountains—barren land and mines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having a mine is indeed an advantage, but it cannot make up for the disadvantage of poor land. Also engaged in agricultural production, the yield per mu in the Salam Mountains is only 70% of that in the plains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The amount of labor input is the same, maybe even more, and the output gap is still so huge, the cost performance of growing grain is obviously not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is only the income from mining, which is an advantage in the short term, but it is a disadvantage in the long run.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the mine is mined, the surrounding land is almost polluted. I'm afraid it will be difficult to keep even 70% of the grain output by then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For nobles who are accustomed to permanently rooting in one place, they must consider the long-term development of the territory. In order to maintain sustainable agricultural production, some nobles would not mine even if they knew there were mines underground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Sikorari, the Salam Mountains are indeed a little remote, and the grain output is also low, but the advantage lies in the large area!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the mining area marked on the map, there are only three outer knights leading the map, and the remaining hundreds of hills are unclaimed land, and the area is almost as large as half of Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the cost of development is relatively high and the cost performance is not very good, it still has development value after all. If it is fully developed, relying on quantity to replenish quality will definitely not lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this requires too much manpower, material and financial resources. Without decades of long-term investment, it's hard to see results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What really made me choose the Salam Mountains was the situation in Wright and Wyton Counties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern nobles did not hesitate to offend the Dalton family in order to go south. Obviously, not a few baronies can satisfy their appetite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Koslow is just a small family. Once there is a conflict with these northern military nobles, it will be difficult to take advantage of force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although a prosperous central town is good, it must be able to be maintained. If the family behind them continues to increase their stakes, I can't consume them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Half-truths, half-false explanations are the most convincing. After all, they are following the governor. In terms of information control, these people in front of them are still better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce's fear of the nobles in the northern Xinjiang was nakedly shown, and they, younger brothers, naturally did not dare to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more you know, the more you know the awe. No one was surprised by Hudson's remarks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Koslow family also originated from the North. It is normal to have some understanding of the strength of the northern Xinjiang nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Indeed, although those guys in the north are annoying, the strength in their hands is still amazing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are allowed to gain a firm foothold, not only the two counties of Wright and Wyton will not be stable, but the entire southeastern province may be very difficult to be peaceful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson, you are too cautious.

The kingdom has clear regulations on the territory area. According to different natural conditions, the area of ​​the noble territory is also different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An ordinary barony has an area roughly between 120 square kilometers and 300 square kilometers. Under special circumstances, there will also be thousands of square kilometers of giants, or tiny territories that are small in size.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, plain areas with fertile land and easy irrigation, and commercial and prosperous places located on major traffic routes, have relatively small areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in mountainous areas where cultivation is difficult, irrigation is difficult, and transportation is inconvenient, the territorial area is larger. The northern land, which is threatened by orcs, has a slightly larger territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is a desert area, only the area of ​​the oasis is counted, and the desert is a bonus, so the territory of every desert lord is a giant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is dominated by fertile plains, and the territories of nobles are usually relatively small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the hilly area where Hudson is located is between the plains and the mountains. It can get a certain amount of care in terms of size, but it will not exceed too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only thanks to the last stubbornness of the nobles in the southeastern provinces that they insisted that these small bumps of soil were mountains, so they became mountains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Responsible for land measurement are relatives and old friends. In terms of specific operations, it is inevitable to be rough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The undeveloped land not marked on the map obviously cannot be counted, and was ignored by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under Hudson's soft and hard foam, plus gold coin public relations, starting from the mining area and extending from south to north, the top 300 square kilometers of territory, that is without any discount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Town to the north of the mining area was encircled by a third, and the plain area suitable for farming alone was close to 50 square kilometers. Hudson deliberately bypassed the three hills next to the Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Made the measurement team feel numb. If it weren't for the clear hint above that the local nobles could be taken care of as much as possible, there would be absolutely no room for negotiation in such a division of territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone complains, it will definitely be verified after one investigation. 100% of illegal operations, without sophistry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, isn't this too much? You make it difficult for us, in case someone makes trouble...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sikolari said in embarrassment. They came here to dig pits and mines for a group of feudal nobles, but not for themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem now, but it does not mean that there will be no problem in the future. Once the lid is lifted, it is their political stain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Sikorari, things can't just look at the surface. From the mining area to Maple Leaf Town, there are mostly undeveloped mountains and forests in between.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, my territory is also the land of Maple Leaf Town, and the enclave of the mining area. In the middle part, only one long and narrow path can be recorded, and the rest can be completely excluded from the area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this way, the area of ​​the registered territory is just over 100 square kilometers. It fully complies with the kingdom's regulations, and no one can fault it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I don't divide it like this, my territory won't be enough! You can't let me annex the three nearby knights, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now these areas are all owned by the owners, and it is against the rules to ask them to move their places. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The banquet last night was not in vain. I learned from chatting with Hudson that many enclaves were born during this territorial division.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many areas can be connected together, but in the end they are separated by artificial boundaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not affected. On the one hand, the territory is at the southernmost tip, and on the other hand, it is the result of public relations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps these hidden dangers can be solved by exchanging land in the future, but human nature is greedy, and after all, it cannot satisfy both parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, there was a gap between the nobles in northern Xinjiang and the local nobles, but now it involves territorial frictions, and the relationship between neighbors will definitely not be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching Hudson gesture on the map, the paper data of the original 300 square kilometers territory has shrunk by half in an instant, and everyone's faces have suddenly become much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you can't find faults on the bright side, the rest is not important. As for whether someone will attack Baron Hudson on the issue of unknown ownership in the future, it has nothing to do with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the final analysis, the world still needs to use strength to speak. What's more, even if someone wants to compete with Hudson for the vast Salam Mountains, they have to be within reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area directly bordering it is separated by Maple Leaf Town and the three knights. Unless one of the knight collars is annexed, the tentacles will not be able to stretch out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom cannot be said to be prosperous, the basic order is still guaranteed. Under the rule system, it is not that simple to annex the territories of neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for the five major families in northern Xinjiang, who completed the big merger by killing people with a knife, the rest of the kingdom maintained a balance. If you want to expand your territory, every step is very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rough framework has been negotiated, and the specific rules do not need to be clarified. He was originally responsible for digging the pit, so naturally he would not clarify all the details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off everyone, Hudson sighed secretly while standing by the stream, looking at Maple Leaf Town a few miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave certainly took advantage of it, but unfortunately, the bureaucrats of the Governor's Mansion still had a bit of integrity, and they couldn't let him take down the Maple Leaf Township.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once an opportunity is missed, it will never come again. There is no ready-made to pick up, and building a big town by yourself is not a small expense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resisting the temptation, he washed his cold face with stream water. Hudson, who had calmed down, looked even more ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interests are touching. I thought I could deal with it properly after seeing through Earl Pierce's plan, but I couldn't help but fall into the pit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land area is limited. If Hudson gets more, it is destined that some people will get less. It is conceivable that the lord who will be entrusted to Maple Leaf Town in the future will have such a heart-fuck!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was supposed to be a wealthy town, but one-third of it was taken away abruptly. If there is compensation elsewhere, that's all. If not, you have to be **** off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Given another chance to choose, Hudson will still not be soft. The plain of more than 50 square kilometers, based on 80% of the arable land, is more than 60,000 mu of good farmland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are ready-made cultivated fields, as long as the serfs clean up the weeds, they can resume farming. It is far more economically valuable than opening up wasteland in hilly areas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the farming habits of the southeastern provinces, the system of \"cultivation, one rest and two rests\" is implemented, and more than 20,000 mu of good land are produced every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land in the southeast province is fertile. Based on 150 pounds of rye per mu, that is 3 million pounds of output. If we rotate all kinds of miscellaneous grains for another season, it is estimated that the total output will be this much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After deducting the cost of farming, the daily consumption of serfs, and the tithe, it is not a big problem for the lord to account for 40% of the income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that as long as there is no war or natural disasters, every noble lord in the southeastern province will have a happy life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as this fertile plain is managed well, most of the food problem in the territory will be solved. Even if the population explodes in the future, it can be solved by continuously reclaiming wasteland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't refuse such a big piece of fat when he put it in his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that he offended a northern Xinjiang nobleman, even if he fought directly, he would not back down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that as long as the interests are in place, there is no principle that cannot be broken. If so, it is not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The development of mining areas is very important, and food self-sufficiency is also of great significance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one maintains it. This season's harvest is hopeless, but the next season cannot continue to be abandoned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of what to plant later, it will require a lot of labor. More than 20,000 mu of land, if you want to reclaim it with the current productivity, you need at least seven or eight hundred strong laborers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the fact that there are enough livestock. Without four or five hundred horses/cows, it cannot be completed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mining is a labor-intensive industry, and a series of links from \"burning charcoal - mining - beneficiation - smelting - continuous casting\" require a lot of labor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough young and strong labor input, it is difficult to restore the previous production capacity in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the main source of income for the territory, production in the mining area must be guaranteed first. There is simply no surplus young and strong labor force that can be invested in land cultivation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of old and weak women and children with a weaker labor force, it is necessary to double the manpower input. Considering that the number of livestock in the territory is seriously insufficient, manpower needs to be used to fill the gap. In fact, the labor force required will definitely be more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With solid mathematical knowledge, Hudson quickly came to the conclusion that the territory is seriously underpopulated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say anything about expanding production capacity, just to restore the previous production, the labor force in the territory is far from enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on how many people can be fooled by the subordinates. There is really a shortage of labor, so we can only figure out a way at that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, at this juncture, even if you want to buy slaves, the southeastern provinces are out of stock!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lords of the two counties of Wright and Wyton are all short of people, and the battle for people has already begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the territory was determined, the price of young and strong slaves in the southeastern province increased by one-third compared to before. Now at this time, I am afraid that it has risen to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who is not rich in pockets, does not have the qualifications even if he wants to be taken advantage of. There was not enough money to buy slaves before, and it is even more unaffordable now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Part of the citizens were separated to resume farming on the newly acquired land. The patrol range of the army was also expanded, and Hudson's center of gravity returned to the mining area again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The simple barracks have been initially set up. Although the living conditions are still rudimentary, they finally got rid of the embarrassing situation of \"the sky is the quilt and the ground is the seat\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A lot of charcoal has been stored, and the mine is almost cleaned up. Although the rebels did a lot of damage, the Salam Mountains are mainly shallow mines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The places with the best conditions can directly carry out open-pit mining. In places that were close to it, the mine tunnel extended at most tens of meters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mining technology is at this level, mining ore buried in deep areas is krypton life. Although the income from iron ore is good, it hasn't made the lords crazy enough to give up their integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they encounter high-purity gold and silver mines, or higher-value magic crystal mines, the miners can only pray for the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The territory has a serious shortage of labor force, and met the conscientious Lord Hudson, so naturally he would not have the idea of ​​​​deep mining areas, even if the ore deep underground is more pure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the strong request of the lord, the iron smelters who completed the preliminary preparations started the first smelting after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the iron ore excavated by the workers and charcoal put into the furnace made of clay together, they started to ignite and dry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bellows on the side replaced the alchemy blower and started working. It can be seen that the workers are very uneasy about this new gadget.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if he was a bystander, Hudson just took a few glances from a distance and left the smelting field directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original iron smelting process, coupled with the charcoal whose firing temperature is not high enough, the quality of the smelted pig iron is not up to standard, which is almost an inevitable result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No miracle happened. The iron block taken out of the smelting furnace was very loose, like an ant nest, with large and small holes, and the purity was so low that Hudson didn't even bother to complain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the workers were very interested. Obviously, the pig iron they usually smelt was of a similar level to this product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing to say, continue to the next round of procedures, beating—calcination—beating—calcination—beating...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After repeated tossing and tossing again and again, after a few hours, the iron block was almost solidified, and the workers put it in water to quench it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Poor-quality pig iron is processed and shaped. According to past practice, this thing can already be traded in the market, and the price is not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the fineness of pig iron, according to the market price before the war, each pound of pig iron can be sold for about 30 to 55 copper coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the post-processing, that is the business of the blacksmiths. Anyway, the previous lord, Viscount Alphonse, never provided after-sales service, and he didn't care what the customer used it for.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the samples in front of him, Hudson stopped thinking about mass production immediately. The pig iron in front of me is undoubtedly inferior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to improve the appearance, you can only go through continuous tempering and burning. There is no further processing, because the cost performance of continuing forging is not high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, charcoal is used. Under the current technology, even if it is tempered a hundred times, the strength will hardly reach the standard for making weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original production model, it is true that selling pig iron can make money, but the profit is far less than Hudson expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the price of pig iron is not low, but it cannot support the low production capacity of the mining area. According to the recollections of the workers, there were more than 4,000 workers in the Salam mining area at its peak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as far as Hudson knows, Viscount Alphonse, the largest pig iron supplier in the southeastern province, has a monthly shipment of less than 180,000 pounds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a part is used for personal use, the per capita daily iron production is only about 1.5 pounds, and the efficiency is so low that there is nothing to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that part of the charcoal needs to be outsourced, and miners consume more heavy physical labor and need more nutritional supplements, plus taxes and infrastructure equipment maintenance costs, it is estimated that the profit is only about 50%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that most of the pig iron produced in the territory is of low quality, and the large-scale wholesale price is still discounted, it is calculated based on the price of 25 copper coins per pound. The monthly income of 180,000 pounds of shipments is only about 3,000 gold coins, and the income is about About fifteen hundred gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this income is very good, and it can also rank among the top among the many baronies in the kingdom, but it is far from the huge profit that Hudson expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to obtain higher profits, it is imperative to improve the smelting process, increase production capacity and improve the quality of pig iron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the support of an industrial system, high-tech technology is definitely out of the question, and Hudson can only choose traditional craftsmanship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blast furnace ironmaking is familiar to many people, but it is not easy to operate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson likes to run around, and has personally come into contact with many blast furnace relics, and has a general understanding of the blast furnace ironmaking process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following the gourd painting, the blast furnace was not built, but the workers were first taught to fire kiln bricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directing the craftsmen under him, Hudson tossed back and forth for more than half a month. After many failures, Hudson worked out the first batch of bricks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it is because the fire control is not in place, maybe the quality of the soil selected is not up to standard, or maybe the workers don't understand Hudson's words properly, the quality of the kiln bricks is hard to describe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cracks appeared on most of the kiln bricks, only a small number of them were like that, and they could barely make do with it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Directing the workers to try to build the blast furnace, Hudson only felt physically and mentally exhausted. Climbing the technology tree is really not something ordinary people can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A set of the simplest primitive iron smelting process is so troublesome to copy. If it is changed to advanced technology that requires supporting industries, is it still worth it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Everyone looks downcast, who is this going to show?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Hudson, who had just harvested a wave of refugees and was delighted by the increase in labor force, suddenly found that his subordinates were not in the right mood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The little brother wants to look like a little brother, so it's unreasonable to shake his face in front of the boss. If it gets out, the outside world can't say that he is not strict?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson getting angry, Tom, who reacted recently, hurriedly put away his emotions and replied: \"Master, the task you ordered cannot continue!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who leaked the news, many nobles ran out to **** people. There are soldiers guarding everywhere, and they arrest refugees when they see them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We encountered several waves of interception along the way, and thanks to your reputation, we were let go. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hudson didn't know what to say. Although I know that this kind of thing won't last long, someone will jump out to grab business. But directly leading troops to rob people, this is too much...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, if you talk too much, you will be in tears. Who made him pay attention to the appearance of eating all the time?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the neighbors have reacted and played the trick of leading troops to rob people. It is impossible to think about pulling people in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't detain his younger brother, and asked them to bring back the fooled person, obviously selling Hudson's face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the aristocratic circle, face is given to each other. Everyone saved him face, and Hudson couldn't help but accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting those who came here one after another, the population of the Hudson Territory has exceeded the 6,000 mark. Although it is still facing the dilemma of labor shortage in general, the development of the territory is still on the right track after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with his colleagues, his territory has developed much faster. Especially those guys from northern Xinjiang, they are still halfway, and the territory has become a no-man's land.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really don't know how they will appreciate the neighbors around when they arrive at the place and see the deserted scene of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unknowingly, Hudson discovered that he had actually dug a sinkhole between the local nobles and the northern Xinjiang nobles, which was no less powerful than the thunder buried by Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Determining people's wealth, such as killing parents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just relying on fooling around, some people will still find it difficult to leave their homeland, and choose to stick to the place and wait for the arrival of the new lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the colleagues did a great job, they directly led the troops to **** people, and didn't even leave the leek root.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that one counts as one, as long as they lead troops to rob people, they are now on the opposite side of this group of nobles who went south and north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being tossed about by his colleagues, Hudson couldn't understand the world. Is this for fear that the nobles of northern Xinjiang will not find out, or do they think that they dare not call to ask for someone?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Offending people to death is not the way to get off your horse. Reason told Hudson that there must be someone manipulating behind this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the previous actions of the Governor's Palace, Hudson has reason to believe that this is the work of Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom has not clearly stipulated that there is no heir after the death of the previous lord, and the ownership of the serfs under his command, everyone still defaults to the new lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unspoken rules are also rules. Without the acquiescence of the boss, no one in the southeastern province would dare to toss about so recklessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Northern Xinjiang nobles robbed the Dalton family of a tiger, and if they didn't take revenge, wouldn't it appear that they were incompetent?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Digging pits and laying mines is a secret method. On the bright side, the Dalton family also needs to come up with countermeasures to let everyone understand that they are the boss of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the nobles enshrined in Wyton and Wright counties, many of them have worked for the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they are separated from the relationship in name, there is absolutely no shortage of connections in the dark. The boss was humiliated, and it made sense for the younger brother to take revenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe it was their own initiative, or it might be the instruction of Earl Pierce. In short, this account will eventually be credited to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The boss can carry the blame, but the board will still hit the person involved. Unless the northern nobles are so strong that they can suppress the Dalton family, the counterattack will only be aimed at a group of younger brothers who are active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After stroking his thoughts, Hudson finally decided to keep a low profile recently. Regardless of how the two sides played games, as a small pawn, the less sense of existence the better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson immediately asked for paper and pen to report the news to the family. He couldn't hold on to it with great difficulty, but was dragged into the water by his tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main thing is to remind Adrian Knight not to have too much fun, especially not to drag the family into the vortex of the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Adrian himself, he was with Earl Pierce, and the imprint of the Dalton family on him was too strong to hide. Maybe he will be the one to lead troops to rob people this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also good to hang out with the boss. As long as you don't take too much notice and don't violate some taboos when you usually execute orders, even if something goes wrong, someone will take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the southeastern province, the Dalton family can still protect them. As long as they don't take the initiative to kill themselves, they basically won't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst thing is that when someone comes to settle accounts, someone takes the opportunity to catch them and beat them hard, so as to lose face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the operation is good, the fight will not be in vain, and at the last time you can show your loyalty to the boss, and if you are lucky, you can get some compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the two fellows in Wyton County, they have just inherited the title, and they are still poor and white. Only relying on the support of relatives can the operation of the territory be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to do something, you don't have the capital in your hands. Not to mention leading troops out to rob people, even if sending people over, they would have to worry about how to support them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After traveling all the way, a group of northern nobles finally arrived at the administrative center of the southeastern province, which is also the headquarters of the Dalton family—Beida City.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any accident, the army was stopped outside the door. The army of Aslante Continent, no matter whether it is elite or rabble, the military discipline is very average.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they were in their hometown, the soldiers could barely do anything wrong. When you become a guest army, it's all about not grabbing white or grabbing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treating foreign troops, everyone fears them like a dragon. Although everyone has now joined the ranks of the nobles in the southeastern province, they are still outsiders in the eyes of the locals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief confrontation at the gate of the city, the nobles in the team also walked to the gate of the city one after another, as if to exert pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The governor has ordered that no army be allowed to enter Beida City without the transfer order of the governor's mansion!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that you are from northern Xinjiang and don't know the rules of Beida City, I won't hold you accountable this time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The middle-aged officer guarding the city said righteously. It can be seen from that contemptuous expression that he is not very interested in the group of northern nobles in front of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I just wanted to ask for an explanation, and I didn't plan to make trouble, but being provoked by the middle-aged officer, all the nobles of the Northland were instantly angered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this anger came quickly, but it went away even faster. Everyone is not a fool, knowing that the other party intends to provoke them, naturally they will not jump into it foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is really for such a trivial matter, there is an armed conflict with the defenders here, no matter how good the reason is, it will become unreasonable in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I saw a young man about 27 or 28 years old, walked up to the middle-aged officer and asked: \"We are all nobles of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeast province will be sealed when you come to the southeast province when you are ordered by the king. Now you are going to visit Governor Pierce. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Whoever owns the territory is in charge. No matter how ugly the faces of the northern nobles are, the army is still stranded outside the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the essence of everyone's conflict is not whether the army stays outside the city, but from the mutual contempt in the bones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the nobles in the northern border could not understand the hypocrisy of the nobles in the southern border;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The core is still a dispute over the interests of the kingdom. In the eyes of the nobles of northern Xinjiang, they guarded the frontier against the invasion of orcs, had illustrious military exploits, made the greatest sacrifice, and deserved to take more benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the nobles in southern Xinjiang don't think so. In the previous orc invasions, everyone took part in the battle with their troops, and no one was defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the nobles of the northern border have undertaken more daily defense, everyone has not given compensation. Every year, the kingdom distributes a large amount of subsidies to the nobles of the northern border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, they are not the only ones responsible for the defense of the northern border. There are also 200,000 kingdom standing troops stationed in the northern border to guard against the invasion of orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This standing army was formed only after nobles from other regions of the kingdom contributed people, money, and supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the southern nobles, the current difficult situation in northern Xinjiang is purely caused by the five major families. Even in the minds of some nobles, the five major families in northern Xinjiang are the cancer of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the establishment of the Alpha Kingdom, the disputes between the North and the South have never stopped. The two sides did not fall out, mainly thanks to the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the orcs invade, the internal conflicts in the kingdom will be minimized in an instant. After all the wars, the Alpha Kingdom will be peaceful for decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's because of the prosperity of the Kingdom of Alpha, or because of a coincidence. Every time the conflicts within the kingdom reached a critical point, a war would break out in northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War cannot resolve conflicts, but it can resolve those who create them. After the war, all parties suffered heavy casualties, and everyone was busy licking their wounds, so naturally they couldn't care less about making noise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the welcome banquet at the Governor's Mansion, everyone was talking and laughing, as if the previous skirmish at the gate of the city did not exist at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone observes carefully, they will find that the nobles on the field are two distinct circles. There is a wave of local nobles, and there is a wave of nobles from northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, there are still a few people who are separated from the two circles and seem out of place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this embarrassment didn't last long. After a group of ladies and noble ladies entered the arena, they quickly found their place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These people were neither from local nobles, nor were they able to integrate into the circle of northern Xinjiang nobles, but nobles from other regions of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a foreigner, he was able to survive in the complicated situation in northern Xinjiang and made enough military exploits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people always know how to weigh the pros and cons. They don't want to be involved in the conflict between the northern nobility and the local nobility, so they naturally find a way to avoid it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with complicated politics, chatting with noble ladies and noble ladies is obviously more pleasing to the eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Drinking fine wine and enjoying delicious food, but the protagonist Earl Pierce has not been seen for a long time, which made all the nobles in northern Xinjiang feel very upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how bad the mood is, there is still a smile on his face. This is the scene of the banquet, and the etiquette of the nobility cannot be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing a group of partners, with a sad look on their brows, Baron Sith pretended to be proud and said: \"You are all free to eat, these are good things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency, Governor, you are really polite!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the wine in this glass is from the royal winery. It is said that every grape used is carefully selected and then prepared by the hands of the master winemaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to limited production capacity, each bottle is worth a lot. Without a certain status, you can't buy it if you want to.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at this golden-yellow roasted rabbit. It is made of Warcraft Snow Rabbit. Most of the spices sprinkled on it come from overseas, so the price will definitely not be cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this caviar is a monster...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are in our Northland, even if you have a celebration banquet, you have to be above the Viscount to be eligible to enjoy it, and the supply is limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, Your Excellency the Governor, you have given us all out to entertain us. What else are you dissatisfied with? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every single sentence sounds like a compliment, but when combined together, it doesn't sound right at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of nobles from northern Xinjiang who reacted followed suit and praised Earl Pierce for his heroism and generosity, and incidentally also interspersed the hardships of northern Xinjiang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to let more people hear, they also deliberately amplified the sound. The stark contrast was directly in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A good banquet quickly becomes wrong. Let a group of nobles who used to mock them barbarians and bumpkins in different ways become speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refutation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is praising Earl Pierce for his generosity, so you can't stand up and deny it, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Praise, that's even worse. Knowing that the other party was taking the opportunity to ridicule, and then following along, it would be slapping Earl Pierce in the face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not the right occasion to change the subject by picking something up! The visitor is a guest, so as the host, you have to be tolerant to the guests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It seems that you misunderstood our Excellency the governor very much! Everyone present is aware of the suffering in the northern border. For the peace of the northern border, the nobles in the southeastern provinces have made great efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after Earl Pierce became the governor, we support the manpower, material and financial resources of Northern Xinjiang every year, but we have repeatedly set new highs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Speaking of boasting, one-eighth of the kingdom's 200,000 standing troops stationed in the north are supported by our southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom supports the money and food distributed by the nobles in northern Xinjiang every year, and one-eighth of it is provided by our southeastern province. It can be said that everyone present is a contributor to the peace of Northern Xinjiang! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the words of the administrative officer came out, the embarrassing native aristocrats immediately burst into the warmest applause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This sudden reversal of the situation made Baron Sith very uncomfortable. It's not that he wants to do things, the problem is that he can't help himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern aristocrats who went south seem to be one, but in fact there are many interest groups inside. Although he is the strongest, it doesn't mean that everyone should recommend him to be the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of the Felix family is really useful, but unfortunately he is only the illegitimate son of Grand Duke Kavadia, not the legitimate son.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is for the sake of Grand Duke Kavadia that everyone shows some face. Deep down, everyone still despises the majority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To regain a group of northern nobles, Sith must make convincing achievements in order to be able to convince them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many big figures in northern Xinjiang, and he is not the only one who has illegitimate children. In addition to the factors of Grand Duke Kavadia, Sith's personal ability is also the key to being able to get the opportunity to lead a group of noble children to the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If his own ability is not good, even with the support of Grand Duke Kavadia, it is impossible for him to become a Viscount in Northern Xinjiang at a young age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ninety-nine percent of the factors are due to his background, and at least one percent is due to his personal efforts. Without that one percent effort, his background can only make him a rice eater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this opportunity to go south, he did not hesitate to surrender his title. Obviously it wasn't aimed at a baron, although in the eyes of the outside world, a fief baron is more valuable than an empty viscount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is Sith's plan to create small conflicts and use the pressure of local nobles to unite the northern Xinjiang nobles who have gone south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the plan is too immature after all, and it has just started to be implemented when it encounters an old fox.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all caused by unequal information. As a political opponent, it's good for the big bosses in Northern Xinjiang not to blackmail their opponents. How can they emphasize their competitors' contributions in front of younger generations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the data is displayed, Sith is immediately passive. After all, he is still too young and not thick-skinned enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sir Antonio, you are right. Everyone is a hero of the kingdom. But now the orcs are about to move, and the next southward invasion may not be far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there is another hole in the military expenditure in northern Xinjiang. In order to raise more military expenditure, the great Caesar III was worried all night. As the nobles of the kingdom, how can we just sit idly by.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to pay too much, as long as everyone saves a little on daily expenses, for example: when holding a banquet, the specifications are slightly lowered, and Northern Xinjiang can add another legion. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not an exaggeration. Thousands of nobles in the southeast province save money together, and it's really not difficult to support a legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The passive situation was pulled back, but Sith was not happy at all. Because Baron Kettley, who spoke just now, is one of his competitors. The better the opponent is, the harder it is for him to take the lead in the team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is not affiliated with each other. It seems that the boss in name is weak, but in fact this is related to the future right to speak in the two counties of Wright and Wyton, as well as the investment of the forces behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cavadia's factors can only make the nobles attached to the Felix family support Sith; the nobles attached to the other four major families will not easily buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, anyone who has some strength at hand wants to compete for the position of team boss. The difference is only that some people have already stated their positions, while others are still waiting for the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the ages of the people, one can tell that the children of the nobles went south, except that their eggs were not put in the same basket, and it was more of an experience arranged for them by the forces behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the best children can get more resources.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The aristocratic bureaucrat who is good at observing words and expressions fully understands the boss's intentions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to sending soldiers to lead the way, they ignored all the nobles in northern Xinjiang, and even the most basic introduction to the territory was sent with a map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no specific distribution of territorial resources, crops suitable for planting, or economic development suggestions, and no one is even informed of the neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical non-blocking, non-cooperative, and irresponsible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, it still surprised all the nobles in northern Xinjiang. The handover was too smooth, and the imaginary difficulties did not happen at all, it was too well-mannered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for vigorous cooperation, no one would have such illusions. How is it possible to go to other people's territory to grab food and ask them to actively cooperate?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fertile fief is about to be acquired, Baron Sith's interest has been raised, but the moment he opened the map, he was dumbfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A good piece of barony land was directly divided into four large pieces, directly spanning the two counties of Wright and Wyton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he extremely wanted to greet the ancestors of Governor Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he got the richest Dadir City, all the land outside the city belongs to other people, and his own territory is still hundreds of miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is reckoned that the neighbors have to nod first to deal with urban garbage. Thinking of this terrible scene, Sith wanted to ask the governor's mansion for an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in the end he held back. The similar operation was not the initiative of Earl Pierce, but was done by the five major families in northern Xinjiang to eliminate dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pot of my ancestors, I can only knock down the front teeth and swallow it in the stomach. Although it is completely against the rules, once there is a disturbance, these old accounts will be brought out again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to letting the family lose one person in the aristocratic circle and causing a round of political turmoil, it is better to suffer this boring loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Sith is quite adaptable because he was mentally prepared to be difficult before he set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar concerns were shared by all the northern Xinjiang nobles. Even if they are not the children of the five major families, they are still the vassals of the five major families. If they slap their own prince in the face, how can the families behind them have a good life?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just an enclave, and it's not impossible to solve it. The big deal is to exchange land with the neighbors, and fight if they don't agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one is not enough, two can be used; if two are not enough, only three or four...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to their past experience in the Northland, as long as they do a lot of fighting, there is nothing that cannot be done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is, the fight must be lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a depressed mood, a group of northern Xinjiang nobles set foot on their respective territories.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Salam mining area, Hudson, who was rejoicing at the success of the first blast furnace ironmaking, suddenly received a notice from the Governor's Office that his good neighbor in the northern border would arrive in Wright County in the near future, so he was ready to \"welcome\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not the most important thing. The key is that the previous bureaucracy in Wright County needs to be reorganized. Someone suggested that he can participate in the county guard competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic self-government is popular in the Alpha Kingdom. As the chief executive of a place, the sheriff is a good job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there are no rebellions or major disturbances in the county, basically nothing will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even taxes are collected by tax officials sent by the king. Of course, most of the time the king is not so boring and can send tax collectors to each district.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few areas, most areas of the kingdom implement a tax package system. Generally, local officials are contracted to collect taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you collect more than you want, you can pay for it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only one big fat difference. If the management is good, it will be easy to get tens of thousands of gold coins into the account every year. In the kingdom, the sheriff also has a special title \"Viscount\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course it is only a false title, not as good as the real fiefdom viscount, but it is also above all the barons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to think about it, but you can collect taxes from a group of nobles with soldiers, and you don't have any strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles who usually serve as county guards are also the most powerful nobles in the county, occupying the largest city and the most fertile land in the county.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if one's own strength is not the strongest, combined with the strength of allies, the overall strength is the strongest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Is he the most powerful nobleman in Wright County?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can give an accurate answer to this question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the game of nobles not only depends on their own strength, but also considers the investment of the family behind them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But what is certain is that even if Hudson is not the strongest nobleman in Wright County, he is still among the top few.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"Shen Bow Knight\" is still very intimidating among the small and medium nobles. Those six hundred veterans were among the top ranks among the feudal nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two are superimposed together, and the lethality that can be erupted is even stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a team battle breaks out, Hudson will hide behind the army and play a sneak attack, which will completely kill ordinary soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you get the full support of the Koslow family, you can really participate in this sheriff competition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Hudson finally resisted the temptation. He admitted that Earl Pierce was indeed generous enough to win the support of the Dalton family's retainers as long as he nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the connections of the Koslow family and Hudson's own management, more than half of the fief lords in Wright County will support him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that he really didn't dare to end until he couldn't figure out the position of the Northland giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if you reach out tentatively. If someone is determined to establish a foothold in Wright and Wyton counties, the Dalton family may not be able to stop it, let alone him, a pawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the grievances between the ancestors of the Koslow family and the giants of the Northland, it is not worth mentioning in front of survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the nobles of the Northland grow big in Wright County, they must abide by the rules of the game, and it is impossible to be as unscrupulous as they are in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the newly baked pig iron, Hudson smiled slightly and thought to himself: \"Come on, but make a fuss! If the world is peaceful, who will sell these things to?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the overall quality of the pig iron in front of us is still not very good, some of them have reached the middle level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is forged several times, it can already be used to forge weapons. If charcoal quenching is added later, it may be forged into steel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is enough. The noble lord despises this kind of iron weapon, but it is still very fragrant to equip it for his army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no other reason, but because it is cheap. The cost of this iron weapon is only one-third of that of steel weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the northern army, it has already been equipped on a large scale. Due to the lack of coal, the southeastern provinces do not produce weapons themselves, and iron weapons are prone to rust due to the humid climate, so relatively few are used.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson immediately wrote to a group of relatives and friends to borrow people. Forging iron is also a technical job.

Looking at the half plaque hanging on the city tower, the barely recognizable \"Da\" character on it proves that this is his territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original big iron gate has long since disappeared. Perhaps at this moment, it has been melted in a blacksmith shop in a certain noble territory, and then cast into various farm tools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The facade looks like this, so naturally there is no need to count on the inside. It can be seen from the thick dust on the ground that this is already a dead city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he had prepared himself, the scene in front of him still angered Baron Sith. It was so deceiving that it did not leave him any hope at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not a single leader, even if there are all kinds of hills and valleys in his chest, there is no room for him to display them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are still happening in countless territories. Not only the citizens were robbed, but even the infrastructure in the territory, which could be destroyed, was also destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical detrimental to others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under normal circumstances, even if there are grievances between the nobles, everyone will not do things like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this time is different, it involves the \"big family of the Northland\", that is, new and old grudges are counted together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past years, Northern Xinjiang has swallowed up the lives of too many nobles. It's fine to simply spill blood on the battlefield, but most of the time it comes from internal fighting, resulting in unnecessary casualties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this account will eventually be charged to the Northland giants. Although many of them are wronged, no one will listen to their explanations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very simple. The five major families in northern Xinjiang have the worst reputation in the aristocratic circle. Back then, the big merger was fun, but the reputation was permanently lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they have been working hard to clean up their crimes in recent years, they still have little success. At the very least, the aristocrats who lost their ancestral property and were forced to leave their homes would carry out the cause of the five black families to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the Dalton family is behind the scenes to fuel the flames, and it is not surprising that under the agitation of the crowd, they do some radical things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After briefly clearing the city gate, Sith held back his anger and led people into the city. Everything is as expected in the worst situation. The once prosperous Dadir City is now in ruins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't get it, you will destroy it. You don't want competitors in the southeastern province to threaten your own status. The Dalton family has done an excellent job in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Governor's Mansion was evacuated from Dadir City, it destroyed everything that could be destroyed, and finally did not forget to set a fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All actions have only one purpose, making it more difficult for the northern nobles to gain a foothold in the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the means are dirty, the effect is really good. To rebuild a territory in ruins, the manpower, material and financial resources required are not a small number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the nobles in the North who are not very wealthy, this expense is even more of a pressure. At the very least, the children of the nobles who went south could hardly complete the task of rebuilding the territory with the funds they carried with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to ask the family for help has become a common worry for all the noble children who went south and north. If you ask your family for help so quickly, you will lose points in front of your elders; if you don't ask for help, where will the money come from?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially small and medium nobles, they need to consider more issues. The reconstruction of the territory requires too much funds. Even if you open your mouth to the family, you may not be able to raise enough funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military investment of nobles in other regions may only account for 30% to 40% of their total income, and only 50% to 60% of their total income.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In friendly matches with orcs all year round, there is no northern noble that does not spend a lot of money on military expenses, and financial deficits are common. Military spending far exceeds the income of the territory, which is just a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't go bankrupt because of financial problems, it's because they have soldiers in their hands, and they rob and **** them when they are in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't think that only orcs will come to the Alpha Kingdom to rob. All the nobles in the northern border area also patronize the orc tribe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that compared with the human race, the economy of the orc tribe is much backward, and the property that can be robbed is much less. Often the most valuable property in an orc tribe is the orc itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, such things as slave traders, noble nobles naturally can't do it, not to mention their conscience. In church belief, this is hell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So usually after the slaves are captured, they are thrown to the merchants to do the work for them. It seems that one more procedure can smooth out their uneasiness in conscience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You said that my people were robbed by soldiers?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sith asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I just wanted to find out what happened in my territory before, but I didn't expect to get such unexpected news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looting is nothing new, but it was a time of war. It is against morality to send troops to forcibly rob the people after the war. Even if the lord has not yet arrived, it is a kind of provocation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Sith, who was so angry, was worried that he had nowhere to go, so he sent it directly to the door without thinking of an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Kavadia taught him since he was a child that everything is imaginary, and only the strength in his hands is real. As long as there is strength, lack of anything is not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a ready-made excuse, it is reasonable for him to lead soldiers to call the door to ask for an explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the timing of the news is too coincidental, as if there is a black hand behind the scenes, secretly manipulating all this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading troops to **** people is such a shameful thing, it must be as low-key as possible, and the participants will inevitably block the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not surprising that the local nobles can inquire about it. It is too coincidental that they, outsiders without roots, also received the news easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, Baron Sith is more willing to believe that someone deliberately let him know this news. The purpose is to stir up disputes between him and his neighbors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make use of the topic or not is a question worth thinking about. Although he is confident in his own strength, Sith does not think that he is really invincible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how weak the aristocrats in the southeast province are, they are also local snakes who have been operating there for many years. If there is a fight, I don't know how many relatives and friends will come to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you accidentally kick on the iron plate, it will be over for you. If Qianglong wants to suppress the local snake, the prerequisite is that he cannot be defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't even beat a local snake, what are you talking about suppressing a local snake?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes kept appearing on every northern Xinjiang noble who went south. As long as there is a brain, it is more or less aware that something is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to make a decision along the way, constantly lingering in the minds of everyone, but still unable to make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, in the face of the cruel reality, everyone's true inner thoughts can't help but lean towards \"using the topic\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maple Leaf Town, after receiving this appalling news, Baron Kettley also became worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with other lords, his luck was worse, and he met a powerful neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the other enclaves were not too limited and far less prosperous than Maple Leaf Town, he would have wanted to change his business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he expressed doubts about the \"elite\" spoken by the nobles in the southeastern province, the cautious Baron Kettley was still unwilling to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, everything else may be blown out. The stepping stone of the cavalry of the Holy See cannot be faked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the soldiers in his hands were all experienced on the battlefield in northern Xinjiang, he didn't think they could be stronger than the cavalry of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps there were other factors in that victory, but it is a pity that Baron Kettley has limited information, and what he can find out is all blown out by a group of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred elites VS six hundred elites, even if the opponent's army is hydrated, it can be added the title of \"Knight of the Bow\", and the underage earth bear, Baron Kettley is still a little unconfident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an aristocrat killed on the battlefield, Baron Kettley does not lack the courage to meet a narrow road and the brave wins, but reason tells him that it is not worth it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the data on paper, I am at a disadvantage. Even if you can win, you will probably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the illegitimate son of the Grand Duke of Baron Sith, he just came from a middle-class noble family attached to the five major families, and did not have so many resources available.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to bring three hundred elites to the south was all his painstaking efforts. In order to feed this team, Kettler ventured deep into the Orc Empire more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If for a conflict, he would wipe out the family fortune that he had worked so hard to accumulate, he would cry to death. As an outsider, there is no way to make up for the loss of soldiers and generals in Wright County.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle Holman, what is the origin of this Koslow family? I seem to be familiar with it, and I seem to have heard of it somewhere.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The ancestors of the Koslow family also originated in northern Xinjiang, and they can be regarded as a middle-class noble with good strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they were on the wrong team back then, and they were unwilling to accept the kindness of the Lochnard family. In an orc invasion, he lost his ancestral land and lost his family fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Koslow family in the kingdom was established by their remnants outside, and the biggest feature is the thriving population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be that they are worried about the continued suppression of the Lochnard family. After the loss of their ancestral land, they changed the previous family gathering development model and embarked on a development path of scattered branches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In many areas of the kingdom, there are their branches, and it is said that some branches have developed to other countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Koslow family is only a small family on the surface, but with the addition of many branches, its strength is not weaker than that of a middle-class noble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The southeastern province is considered to be the area where they bet heavily, and there are more than a dozen lords, large and small. In the counties of Wright and Wyton alone, there are two baronets and two knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How about the specific strength, it is difficult to find out for a while. However, this mountain baron should be the most powerful branch of the two counties. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman replied slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The apprehension in his tone is obviously against conflict with the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley, who was on the side, also felt his scalp go numb. A large number of people does not necessarily mean great strength, but a large number of people must have many relatives and friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobles are a group that is good at grouping together, especially when facing foreign enemies, everyone is more accustomed to grouping together to keep warm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he didn't take the lead to ask for an explanation. Otherwise, who is being beaten now is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other side is strong in the first place, and if a group of relatives and friends are brought in to help out, Kettley will not be able to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he wanted to be an enemy, he would have to bring together a group of northern Xinjiang nobles. Unfortunately, he didn't have that prestige. At least those who have more prominent identities in the backstage will not buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know Uncle Holman. I originally wanted to visit the famous mountain baron, but now it seems a bit inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The top priority is to rescue the robbed citizens and restore the vitality of the territory. By the way, ask for a sum of compensation to make up for our financial hole. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baron Kettley said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not counseling, it is completely adapting to the situation. Although Hudson Territory has the largest population and is the largest fat sheep nearby, this guy who looks like a sheep is actually a bear in disguise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Persimmon is weak, and if he is not sure of taking Hudson, he can only pick a weaker neighbor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if he wants to find Hudson's bad luck, the reasons in his hands are not sufficient. It is normal for the nobles and lords to attack each other, but the reason for the fight must be sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting refugees is not morally censurable, let alone a reason to stir up disputes. Doing things forcibly can easily attract the intervention of the Governor's Office.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kately, don't rush to take the lead. Even if we want to do it, we can't be the first to provoke a conflict, otherwise there will be big troubles in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to send someone to inform first, if they are willing to send the person back, then it is best not to use force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As outsiders, everything we say and do will be magnified. Taking the lead in provoking disputes can easily arouse the hostility of the local nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, this is the southeast province, and these local nobles have far more network resources than us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once caught by the enemy, it will be very detrimental to our future development. After all, the hostility is only temporary, and if you want to gain a real foothold here, you have to integrate into the local aristocratic circle after all. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight Holman persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This nephew has behaved differently since he was a child, and he is completely outstanding among his peers. It's just that the special environment in northern Xinjiang forced him to restrain his edge so as not to arouse the fear of the five giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opportunity to go south presented itself, and without the slightest hesitation, the high-level family decided to let Kettley jump out of the cage of the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe this road is still difficult, but at least there is further hope, which is better than only relying on the five giants in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Uncle Holman. We should leave this kind of showmanship to our Baron Sith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that some guys who are impatient have already gone to seek justice from him. As the most powerful baron among the nobles who went south from the north, he has always regarded himself as the leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a time like this, it's time for the leader to appear. Aristocrats who are evasive and lack of responsibility cannot convince everyone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kately said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he was not very convinced by Baron Sith who overwhelmed him. If he had the same resources as the other party, Ketley believed that he would not be weaker than others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, there is no way. The name of an illegitimate child is indeed not good, but there are a lot of resources that can be obtained with a grand duke as my father.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't know that Hudson, who had escaped a storm, was busy selling assembly line operations to craftsmen in order to increase production capacity. Apprentices are not developing in an all-round way, and everyone only needs to learn one process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you like it or not, the lord's orders are still obeyed. Although many blacksmiths agreed that this model could not produce qualified blacksmiths, Hudson remained unmoved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era when weapons and armor were all made by hand, the treatment of blacksmiths was not low, even if they were cultivated by noble lords, they would also be given courtesy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is in a big city, in addition to ensuring that the family has no worries about food and clothing, the blacksmith can also have some money for drinks. He can go to the tavern for a drink from time to time, and occasionally go to the entertainment venue to indulge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not so many entertainment facilities in the countryside, but wine and meat can still be supplied. Among the bottom society, it is considered the best wave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason for such good treatment is scarcity. In order to maintain this scarcity, the small group of blacksmiths has always retained the most primitive father-son inheritance system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, blacksmith apprentices are coolies. If you have a flexible mind, you can still learn a little bit; if you are not smart, you can only waste time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apprentices want to become blacksmiths, apart from working hard to steal the teacher, the most important thing is to figure it out on their own. Among them, a small number of talented apprentices can gradually become a blacksmith after countless attempts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who knows the wisdom of the people at the bottom, has never had any illusions about cultivating qualified blacksmiths in batches.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, he doesn't need a casting master, as long as he can knock out weapons. They are all equipped for ordinary soldiers, even if there is a little flaw, it will not hurt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dismantling the forging process, the apprentices were also divided into groups according to actual needs, and each group was supervised by a blacksmith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In front of Hudson, none of the blacksmiths dared to hide their secrets. After all, they are all just learning a process, and they can't shake their status.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that they are all on loan, and they still have to go back after working for a while, and they don't need to live in the Salam mining area all the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, the sound of knocking and knocking kept ringing. Under Hudson's personal supervision, the first batch of assembly line weapons was released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Baron, these weapons are basically unqualified, most of them have fatal flaws, and it is difficult to sell them at a good price in the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at these big swords, they are all of different weights and lengths, and even the blades are not up to standard, obviously something went wrong with the quenching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Look at these arrows again, each one is different in size, the place that should be thin is thicker, the place that should be thick is thinner, and the round hook has changed...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is processed into an arrow, it will inevitably affect the range and accuracy of the bow and arrow, and the penetration and lethality will also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And these spearheads, made one by one...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the weapons in front of him that were sprayed **** by the old blacksmith, Hudson was not angry but happy. It's not for our own army, so why pay attention to quality!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how unqualified it is, it is still an iron weapon, which is far stronger than holding bamboo or wooden sticks as weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the aristocrats who want to expand their armaments, but their pockets are not very rich, these cheap and inferior weapons are still very cost-effective.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a high-quality weapon is produced, Hudson will not dare to sell it. How big a meal is there, and how big a bowl is served.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Large-scale weapons production is not only an economic issue, but also a strategic issue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Limited by lack of resources, even the Dalton family can only produce weapons on a small scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family, who have a big family and a big business, will not take it seriously to make a little money by engaging in inferior weapons. After all, they can also make this thing, and they can't equip it to the elite troops, so they don't want to ruin their reputation for a little money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once high-quality weapons can be mass-produced, the situation will be completely different. It may not be so extreme to grab it directly and pay attention to Earl Pierce, who eats his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is possible to propose a land exchange, but it is a high-probability event. Now Hudson has no confidence to reject the \"goodwill\" released by the boss of the southeastern province.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Liha, just forging according to this standard is fine. We are facing a low-end market, and the most important thing is to reduce production costs, and we don't need to pursue such high quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the defective rate is a little bit high, there are still a small number of qualified products after all, which can be regarded as a surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pick out all qualified products, and package the rest after processing the appearance. After the inventory is enough to equip 5,000 people, the news will be released. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
