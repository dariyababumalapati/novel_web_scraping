Maxim was able to control the forbidden curse freely, if they didn't avoid it, what fell would be the real forbidden curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Resisting the forbidden curse with their small bodies, ninety-nine out of ten will end up in ashes, and there is a one percent chance of leaving a little wreckage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you choose to dodge, the original defensive formation will be gone. In the face of Bear Stearns' sneak attack, if he was prepared, the eighth-rank paladin could still make two moves, and the rest would be in a tragedy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disparity in strength is too great. No matter how well prepared you are, you can't stop the strong in the sanctuary from launching a sneak attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially magicians are the worst. Even the eighth-level great magister, once Bear Stearns gets close, there is no room for struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giant dragon attracts everyone's attention in front, and the earth bear plays a sneak attack from behind. Such a golden combination directly made the Holy See and his party lose their temper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the continuous reduction of the team, and wanting to organize a counterattack, I don't know where to start.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that the dragon knight Hudson would be a weakness, but unfortunately the dragon didn't play close combat with them, but just released magic harassment in the sky from a distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After advancing less than five kilometers, they were attacked seven times. The original team of more than 200 people has now been reduced by more than half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing the seriousness of the problem, Jerachic said with a gloomy face: \"The gang of hypocritical nobles have the most reputation, and Hudson was able to lower his face and sneak attack, making it clear that he was not going to let us leave alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gunfire has stopped, and the enemy's navy is outside. The evacuation plan we made earlier is no longer feasible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Right now, the only way we can break out is to take shelter on the island first, and wait for the fog to cover the sea area again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The target is too big for everyone to gather together, and it is easy to be targeted by the enemy. Then we spread out and live or die by luck.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as someone is alive, bring the news back, let...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, he was interrupted by the meteorite rain falling from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy's sneak attack is coming again!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this idea came to mind, Jerachich didn't hesitate any longer, and immediately ordered: \"Separate and go!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This order is very cruel, which means that most of the people in the team will die in the pursuit of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, instead of gathering together and being grinded to death by the enemy's sneak attacks round after round; it is better to disperse to hide and seek that glimmer of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the ship is destroyed by the enemy, even if everyone gathers together, there is no way to evacuate Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I can only bet on my life, betting that after the fog covers this sea area again, there will be merchant ships straying into this place, creating a chance for them to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, they could only be trapped and starved to death on this isolated island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The team fled in all directions, and indeed won a glimmer of life, but it also created an opportunity for Bear Stearns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, it could only be a sneak attack, but now it has directly become a chase. Flying separately in the face of disaster, you don't need to outperform the enemy, just outperform your companions is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man running at the front of the team suddenly realized that something was wrong. He always felt that something was staring at him from his back. When he looked back, it was a giant dragon that was chasing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, I have something to discuss! Everyone is...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the old man could finish speaking, the rain of fire had enveloped the sky, scaring him to dodge in a hurry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that everything was in vain. He escaped the magic attack, but he couldn't avoid Maxim's dragon wagging its tail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crispy skin attribute of the magician is exposed at this moment. Even if he propped up the magic shield, he still couldn't avoid the fate of being patted into flesh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was at the last moment before his death that the old man realized the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no grievances and no enmity, so many younger brothers along the way did not kill, and he was specifically caught and chased by him, obviously for the \"glory scepter\" in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that it was too late for everyone to realize all this. If he had reacted earlier and thrown the artifact in his hand when he was running for his life, he would definitely not have died so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting away the scepter of glory, Hudson sighed. It's not that he's cruel and merciless, it's because things are too tricky, so I have to silence him!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he took the Excalibur just now, he hadn't realized it yet. When the old man released the forbidden spell with the help of the staff, he realized that it was the legendary \"Scepter of Glory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holy Crown\", \"Scepter of Glory\", and \"Holy Sword of Light\", the standard three-piece set of the Holy See's artifacts, unexpectedly two of them fell into his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this news gets out, there will never be peace in the Mountain Territory. Not only is the Holy See looking for trouble for him, but other forces in the mainland will also spy on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at this Holy See squad, you can see how deep the real top power is, and it is simply not something he, a dragon knight, can parry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, the only way to kill them is to silence them. Hudson has already made up his mind, if he can't strangle all the Holy See and his party, then block the foggy sea area and prohibit ships from traveling this route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This matter is obviously not something that he can accomplish alone. It is only possible to do it together with several nearby coastal nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Hudson's current status, it is not difficult to ask everyone to sell favors, but the difficulty is not to arouse suspicion from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human nature, the more you block it, the easier it is to arouse everyone's curiosity. The blockade of the route can only block the passing merchant ships, but it cannot stop these great nobles from sending people to explore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are two paths before Hudson:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, carve up the two artifacts with the Dalton family and face the crisis together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just based on Hudson's understanding of Earl Pierce, he is not such a courageous person. What's more, artifacts are of no real significance to the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The political significance of the artifact is mainly to divide the legal system of the Holy See, which cannot be controlled by a large noble alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both artifacts are of the light system, and at least two eighth-level practitioners of the light system must be found to be able to basically drive them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they gave the artifact to the Dalton family, they couldn't find anyone who could use it. For the Dalton family, keeping the artifact in their hands is purely a hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Second, throw one piece to the king, divert the firepower, and return some benefits by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the only people who knew that he had obtained the two artifacts were people from the Holy See. As long as these people are not allowed to leave alive, the outside world will not know that both artifacts are in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a miracle that such a artifact can meet one. If you meet two people at once, no one will believe you when you tell them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, you can only gain if you give up!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Hudson made a choice between the two artifacts. The \"Scepter of Glory\" can't be used at all, and the \"Holy Sword of Light\" can still be used to cut people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, the sealed holy sword of light looks similar to his knight sword. Because of Maxim, no one dared to check his knight sword up close, and no one would notice if it was replaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A decision was made, and when Hudson wanted to catch a living person for questioning, Bear Stearns finished the work first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few lucky ones who were hidden, the rest either became ghosts under the claws of bears, or died under the mouths of poisonous insects. If you want to get an answer from them, you may have to summon the undead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does know a little bit of undead magic, but how could someone who has dealt with heresy for a long time be unprepared?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The holy water they carry with them greatly reduces the probability of turning them into undead. Even if the summoning is successful, most undead creatures cannot retain the memory of their lifetime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why the \"Battle of Glory\" and \"Holy Sword of Light\" appeared here has become an unsolved mystery here in Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The high level of the Holy See must know, but it is impossible for him to ask. It is important to satisfy curiosity, but it is even more important to keep your life alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Putting down his inquisitive thoughts, he picked up the artifact and returned to the fleet, only to see a group of pirates gathered on the shore to surrender to the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, these guys who surrendered are smart people. Knowing that the people of the Holy See would not let them go, they decisively changed their followers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they are in trouble at this moment. The fleet in front of them not only represents the Dalton family, but also the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two companies can work together, but how to deal with these pirates needs to be decided after discussion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps out of respect for the strong, the fleet just let the pirates stay on the shore, and did not immediately accept their surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the leader of the pirates resting on the shore, Hudson said indifferently: \"I will give you a chance to survive and explain everything you know clearly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't try to hide it, without our shelter, you can't survive a month on the island! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Hudson has already begun to think about whether to silence this group of people together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates are pirates after all, even if they surrendered, Hudson can still find an excuse to kill them all, not to mention that they have not yet accepted their surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, my lord, I will explain everything!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I was a down-and-out aristocrat in a small country in the middle of the country. Because of the decline of my family, I went out to find a living, and was later spotted by people from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since then, according to their instructions, he has become a pirate and has been active in the south-central waters all year round.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I was chosen to go north to Dulong Island this time, mainly because I entered this place by mistake once when I was wandering in the mainland, and I survived and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose of the Holy See's trip seems to be to find some artifact on the island. My status in the Holy See is very low, and that's all I know. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Man Beard's answer, Hudson's killing intent subsided a bit. It doesn't matter if you don't know, but you're afraid of knowing too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who asks, Master Hudson only got one artifact in Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have already obtained the artifact, but there are still many remnants of the Holy See active on the island. These people are not weak, and they hide in the dark, so there is no time to encircle and suppress them for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron, before the fog can block your view, you send people to search around the island and destroy all the ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is an antique ship from hundreds of years ago, I will smash it to pieces with the magic crystal cannon. Don't let go of large pieces of wood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The time left for us is running out, we must destroy all the navigation tools before the fog rises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let's put these pirates here first, I'll watch them in person, and I'll take them with me when I go back! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Command tone, should not appear among partners. However, Hudson's status is special, and he also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Kingdom's war readiness mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A position where even he himself can't figure out the boundaries of power, the outside world is even more confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it has the power to mobilize the country's armed forces, the capital did not give an accurate statement, but this does not affect Hudson's ordering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Obey, Lord Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron replied respectfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he wanted to discuss the ownership of the artifact, but he forcibly took it back when the words came to his lips. Regardless of who the artifact belongs to, it is not his turn to be a descendant of his family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earl's nephew did not open his mouth to talk about this issue, and he was too lazy to be the first bird.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Negotiating this kind of thing needs to pay attention to identity reciprocity. Letting them negotiate with Hudson will obviously suffer a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet began to perform missions, and only Viscount Cayo stayed in place with a group of guards and Hudson. In name, they helped guard the pirates, but in fact they still missed the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Hudson snatched the thing, and Kayo really didn't know what excuse to intervene to get a share of the action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Scepter of Glory, are you interested?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson threw the scepter in his hand to Viscount Cayo without hesitation, as if he had lost a big trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The scepter of glory of the Holy See!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How can this be?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kayo said with a trembling voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the symbol of the Holy See, the scepter of glory will appear in almost every grand ceremony. There is no news of the loss at all, but the magic wand in his hand cannot deceive anyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, Kayo hastily returned the scepter of glory to Hudson. This thing is really not something that the Dalton family can worry about, taking it back will only bring disaster to their own family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Lord Earl, you obtained this item, you can handle it yourself, we will not participate!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Hudson pretended to be embarrassed and showed a wry smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The scepter of glory is different from ordinary artifacts, and it is really too hot for our two families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the Dalton family is not interested, I will send it to the capital. If His Majesty the King wants to establish a separate Holy See, this is the best legal basis. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV is not Caesar III, no one can be sure whether he dares to take this hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But throwing things out is better than staying in the southeast province and causing trouble for oneself. With the size of the Alpha Kingdom, as long as the king has ambitions, he can still withstand the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Earl, this topic is too sensitive. There are still a group of pirates here, and it is really not suitable for discussion now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Kayo said in a panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is really scared. Hudson can talk about things in an open and honest manner, because his own strength is strong enough, and he is not burdened with too many debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo can't. Although he is a direct member of the Dalton family, he is only a \"member\" and not the heir of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political weight is much lower than that of Hudson. If you get involved recklessly, you might die at some point.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Holy See, it is very difficult to kill a dragon knight, but it is not difficult to kill a son of a great nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In political struggles, Hudson has never done things absolutely, but he is worried that he will push people into a hurry, and the other party will directly break through all political bottom lines and attack ordinary members of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, the Scepter of Glory is not suitable for keeping. I will send it to the capital after dealing with the affairs on the island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These pirate captives can only be used as coolies, they are of little value, and there is no need to subdivide them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply, you and I each have half, and you can send half of the people to the mountain area afterwards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naked conspiracy, the opportunity is given. If the Dalton family wants a piece of the pie, they just need to send someone to follow them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The artifact cannot be given in vain, and the king will definitely compensate in other ways. The benefits are visible to the naked eye, but the risks are also close at hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is uncertain how long the news can be blocked. Once it is spread, the political consequences of robbing the artifact and killing important members of the Holy See will be borne by both families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these, some pirate captives are really not worth mentioning. For the Dalton family, these people can only be used as coolies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moment he took the scepter of glory, Viscount Kayo's first reaction was to silence these people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few hundred captives in the area, and the Dalton family, which has a large family and business, does not lack this labor force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you can decide for yourself, we will not participate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The successful completion of this operation is mainly due to your credit. You have the right to dispose of all spoils.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pirates captured, we will send you a lot of them to your territory afterwards. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Cayo hastily refused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He believed that even if his uncle was here, he would make a similar decision. If they had known that there was a scepter of glory on Dulong Island, they would not have joined in the fun no matter what.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is not to mention the loss of the family, and it may be involved in the maelstrom of the game between kingship and theocracy. If the family is not careful, the family will be photographed to pieces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let Hudson handle this kind of hatred. Dragon knights are rough and thick, and can withstand wind and rain, ordinary people like them can't.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Kayo's desire for strength reached its peak. The lack of peak combat power has become the biggest shortcoming restricting the development of the Dalton family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the abnormality of the dragon knight, even training a few eighth-level powerhouses can increase one's own right to speak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is Kayo not knowing what happened on the island. If he knew that in the team sent by the Holy See this time, there were eight eighth-level powerhouses and more than twenty seventh-level powerhouses, his perception of peak powerhouses would change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has no intention of showing off his record, and the way he wins is not in line with the aristocratic spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Buying the truth forever is the best choice. When the Holy See retaliates in the future, it is better to let the Dalton family accompany them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Purely from the statistics, there is not a single weakling in the Vatican team of more than 200 people. Obviously, it is not possible for Hudson to kill all of them with one person and two monsters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the understanding of normal people, the Dalton family must have participated in the battle, and the two sides joined hands to commit the murder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People will only believe what they see. The Dalton family fleet suffered heavy losses, and there is a high probability that the Holy See will calculate the battle losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ghost Ship\", \"Storm at Sea\", the more legendary these legends are, the less people believe them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fog gradually thickened, as if it was about to cover the entire sea area, and the noisy Dulong Island became silent again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet began to slowly return home. A dragon chant pierced through the air, and Hudson had already left first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If the news hadn't been leaked, he would have taken it privately, so how could he hand it over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is a threshold for the use of artifacts, after ten or eight years, no one is still a great magister of the light system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing on a giant dragon, holding two artifacts, full of magic attack and physical attack at the same time, the scene is exciting just thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Dalton family was the first to discover something was wrong. I was invited to participate in this operation by Earl Pierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After strangling the pirates and seizing the scepter of glory, I ordered the news to be blocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, there was too much movement about the birth of the artifact. During the battle, the enemy even released a forbidden spell with the artifact, which was seen by almost the entire fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they don't know what kind of artifact it is, there are very few artifacts in the entire continent that can release the curse of the light system, and the people of the Holy See can definitely guess it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are still remnants of pirates on Dulong Island. Because of the fog, we have not been able to completely wipe them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these people leave alive, it will be even more troublesome. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson explained perfunctorily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blocking the news is purely a dream, everything else can be faked, but the loss of the Dalton family fleet cannot be fooled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with the disappearance time of the \"pirates\" and the time when the Dalton family fleet went to sea, normal people will have associations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the entire fleet is silenced, the Holy See will be able to confirm that its inherited artifact has fallen into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom after a little investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister found an excuse to temporarily block the routes in the misty sea area by the coastal provinces. We must not allow the Holy See to obtain evidence that the scepter of glory is in our hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs, in the name of preparing for war, summoned nobles from all over the world to discuss matters in the capital! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The excitement of obtaining the artifact is gone, replaced by endless anxiety in my heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha has always had the idea of ​​​​separating the Holy See. In the era of Caesar III, it clearly listed the plan and put it into action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of branches are ready-made. As long as they announce the establishment of a separate door, the church organization of the Alpha Kingdom will be able to pull out a small Holy See immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that he has obtained the scepter of glory, it undoubtedly makes up for the shortcomings in the jurisprudence of the separate Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Q is: bestowed by the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the omnipotence of the Lord of Dawn preached by the church, the outflow of artifacts bestowed by the gods is also the will of the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the loss of the scepter of glory is a very serious religious and political event, which directly affects the legitimacy of the contemporary pope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No news has come out so far, and it is estimated that the bureaucrats of the Holy See dare not take responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They didn't say anything, so we pretended to be confused too.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military action taken by the southeastern province is only to eliminate pirates and has nothing to do with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is to establish a separate Holy See or trade the Scepter of Glory, it will not be too late to decide after the Continental War is over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the royal family, the first thing to consider is stability. The prospect of the continental war is unclear, and it is definitely not a good thing to anger the Holy See at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, you should stop being disturbed by it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scepter of glory involves too much, no matter whether we set up a separate sect now, the Holy See will not let it go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is destined to become an enemy, so it is better to take advantage of the opportunity of the continental war to bring in all the countries of the Northern Continent together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once we act, the Frankish Kingdom will definitely follow up. With their influence, there is no need to worry about no country following them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See will be divided into three at least. If several other big countries have ideas, the Holy See will be divided even more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are new Holy See all over the place. The Holy See has to be busy stabilizing the basic market, but has no time to take revenge on us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation is serious, we will take a step back at worst, and there will be no pope for the time being after the establishment of the new Holy See. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Tyrone retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to establish a separate sect, the Alpha Kingdom Church has made a lot of efforts, and now it is short of an opportunity to become independent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this opportunity is missed, even if it becomes independent later, it will only be a small Holy See in the region, and it will be difficult to spread its influence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to compete with the Holy See for the orthodox position of the Church of Dawn, it is even more hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't seize the orthodox position, how can you meet the Lord of Dawn after you die?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, religious people are particularly persistent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a qualified melon eater, Hudson quietly watched the crowd quarrel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the artifact to the establishment of the Holy See, and then to this continental war, the topic is getting further and further away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that the opinions within the royal family cannot be unified for a while. The key now depends on which side Caesar IV supports.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is far from enough. To withstand the revenge of the Holy See, it is necessary to attract a large number of nobles in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best to bring in a few more international allies to share the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea is beautiful, but the reality is cruel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alpha Kingdom, obtaining the Scepter of Glory at this moment is essentially picking up a hot potato.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With insufficient strength, all plans are in vain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are strong enough, you can stand on your own with or without a divine weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Caesar IV is decisive enough, he should trade the Scepter of Glory in exchange for the strategic materials most needed by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Franks, the Kingdom of Iberia, and the Kingdom of Hesse... are all good buyers, and they can also provoke conflicts between at least one major country and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See can pay a sky-high price, it doesn't hurt to sell it to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics, interests come first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rationality is one thing, reality is another. Even though he knew how to maximize his benefits, Hudson still chose to remain silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reaction of the royal family, it is obvious that they want to occupy the scepter of glory and enhance their overall strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Hudson, what advice do you have?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps because everyone was arguing, Caesar IV suddenly asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, this is a big matter. I don't have any experience in dealing with it. I'd better listen to the opinions of your seniors!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't want to participate in such an offending thing. Even if he really made a suggestion, it was impossible for Caesar IV to listen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he implicitly stated his position the first time he gave the scepter of glory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he agrees, as the king, he can make a decision directly instead of bringing so many people to discuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously wanted to keep the \"Scepter of Glory\", but worried about causing trouble. The heart is vacillating, and more people are needed to support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, the Governor's Mansion is still brightly lit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kayo, are you sure the artifact that Hudson grabbed is the Scepter of Glory?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family has shown signs of decadence in recent years. The descendants of the direct descendants are weak, the high-end power of the family has suffered heavy losses, and competitors have risen strongly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to be able to stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the critical moment when he was about to participate in the continental war, there was another incident of artifacts, and Earl Pierce was really tired.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Definitely! During the battle, the people of the Holy See used the power of the artifact to release a forbidden spell, and many people saw it at the time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the battle, Earl Hudson threw the scepter of glory to me for inspection, and it looked exactly the same as the legendary scepter of glory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was a counterfeit, Hudson would have swallowed it himself, and it would be impossible to send it to the capital! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Earl Pierce nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is right not to participate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this kind of thing gets involved, you will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See may not be able to deal with a dragon knight, but it is not difficult to kill him to vent his anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a bunch of lunatics in the Holy See, as long as they think they are right, they dare to do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The assassination of the late emperor had the shadow of the Holy See behind it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have to reevaluate Hudson's strength now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people of the Holy See released the forbidden spell, but none of them could hurt him at all. It seems that the rumors should be true.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His dragon, even if it is not the Dragon King, is infinitely close to the Dragon King in strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of a bear of the earth, looking at the entire continent of Aslante, it is probably the most peak existence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eventful autumn! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if the competitor is super strong, but in the following continental war, the opponent still occupies the dominant position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way to solve the troubles within the province, and the international situation may change dramatically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weight of the \"Scepter of Glory\" is not comparable to that of the \"Horn of the Blood Moon\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is put up for auction, tens of millions of gold coins can be sold casually. If the competition is too fierce, it is possible to exceed 100 million.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving aside the religious and political value, the optical artifact itself cannot be measured by money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using an orthodox divine weapon requires a price, but it is far less serious than an evil weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even driving the blood moon horn once can directly **** people dry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man released the forbidden spell with the scepter of glory, and was able to escape alive and well, which is enough to illustrate the gap between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also krypton life, the evil weapon is directly finished at one time, and the artifact may consume some blood, or a few months of life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as it is not overused, you can find a way to make it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Uncle needn't worry, judging from what Hudson did, he shouldn't regard us as competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet going to sea this time suffered heavy losses, mainly due to the storm at sea after being attacked by a ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The encirclement and suppression of the personnel of the Holy See on Dulong Island was completed independently by Hudson, and he did not use our people as cannon fodder. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay not to be comforted. After listening to Kayo's comfort, Earl Pierce became more and more depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competitor who kept him up at night didn't take him seriously. This attitude of ignorance is the greatest insult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, from the standpoint of the family, he can only say: more insults like this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being ignored by Hudson is just a matter of face; being deliberately targeted is fatal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Forget it, as a new great aristocrat, if Hudson wants fame, then give it to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to have a competitive competitor than one without a bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Koslow family has been passed down for thousands of years, and there is only one Hudson, and the overall quality of other members is far from ours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as they survived the continental war, relying on the family background, it is not difficult to stabilize their position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to inform Kick to make more contacts at the Arcane Academy, which will be of great use in the future! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the quality of the members of the Koslow family is not very high, there are really many of them. In just two or three years, another Dalton family was born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just these words, Kayo could only hold back in his stomach. If you say it, it will only make the scene more embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Omega, the exciting defense of the capital has come to an end. Facing the continuous offensive of the orc army, the defenders could only retreat to the inner city for the final struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the main hall of the royal palace, everyone in the Principality wore armor one after another, waiting for the city to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell the people below, no matter what, we must persist until dark, this is our only way of survival!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baird I spoke the most embarrassing words in the most ruthless tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no such thing as living and dying with the country. A principality that was born less than three years ago has not had time to establish a sense of belonging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early before the orc army besieged the city, everyone moved their families out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the need to give an explanation to the Race Alliance, they would have run away long ago, and it is impossible to resist until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the very beginning, they planned to break out of the siege, and it is conceivable how strong the high-level resistance of the Principality of Omega is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ones who are really desperate are the bottom soldiers who don't know the truth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Majesty! We have set up a lot of traps in the city. Even if we break the city early, we can delay the time until dark.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jefferson said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the absence of reinforcements, the Principality of Omega has been able to persist until now, which has exceeded many people's expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the original plan, they prepared to resist for a month before breaking through. As a result, with the efforts of the Ministry of Military Affairs, we persisted until the 32nd day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the reason, the defense of the capital can be fought for such a long time, and it can already give an explanation to the tribes and countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the time of the orc invasion in the early stage, the Principality of Omega has resisted the orc soldiers for 42 days. This record is in line with the self-positioning of a new principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, have you arranged for someone to meet you?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baird I asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is a king who wants to be restored, and he must survive this war. Only by living can there be hope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most elite troops of the principality are deployed outside to take care of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as we break out of the siege, they will be responsible for stopping the orcs' pursuit. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Cameron said affirmatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most elite army did not invest in resisting aggression, but was arranged as a force to break through the encirclement. The signs of paddling in the war are too obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, to restore, you must preserve your strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone came out to start a business, and already got the family's venture capital. It's not that simple if you want to come again after losing all your money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was determined that the Principality of Omega could not hold on, and they withdrew their strength in advance, which in itself was a timely stop loss after the failure of the business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be just a simple stroke, but the difficulty of the actual operation is not low at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just arranging support is a technical job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Come out early, once the orc finds out, it will give away the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They came out late and didn't respond in time, and their group of \"entrepreneurs\" became the souls of the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using the limited strength in your hands to fight a battle that can be seen in the past is also a test of ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the attack strength of the orc army is stronger, the city will be destroyed in less than a month, and the record is completely unrecognizable, and the family behind them will not be able to help them operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing the qualification for restoration is second, and the key point is that they may be killed by the Human Race Alliance to make an example of them, and they will be held accountable for desertion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sky gradually dimmed, and there was a loud \"boom\", and the earth trembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of military experience knows that this is the aftermath of the collapse of the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The city was broken, and for some reason, not only did everyone not panic, but they felt a sense of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting in a lonely city all the time, the pressure is unimaginable for ordinary people. Instead of living in a state of depression every day, it is better to let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next breakout battle will be the moment when life and death are at stake, and wealth and honor are in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Baird I pulled out his knight sword and ordered to everyone: \"Break out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Emerald Palace, the royal family is still arguing about the \"Scepter of Glory\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bored, Hudson resigned directly to Caesar IV. It's a pity that he was still a step too late, and was stopped by Grand Duke Affiero as soon as he stepped out of the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs had been waiting for him for several months, and finally someone came, so how could they let him go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the gift of the artifact, no one raised the previous question. The power struggle that was originally in an anxious state has also seen light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't that Caesar IV wanted to make concessions, it was actually the parties in the kingdom that forced him to make concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the opinion of many people, it would be good for His Majesty the King to watch over any military issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles are far away, and the pressure exerted is not obvious. The ministers in the capital are the main force to force Caesar IV to make concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more direct descendants of the royal family, the stronger the expression on this issue. After confirming the eyes, everyone is really afraid that Caesar IV will make a show again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom can't afford to lose, the great nobles in the country can't afford to lose, and the civil and military officials in the capital can't afford to lose either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the issue of power falling apart, it is best to have a smooth handover after the war. If someone doesn't know the interest and continues to occupy the position, it's not too late to consider taking measures.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that Hudson has a good impression on everyone, and most people don't think he will be exclusive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the name is not right, the words will not be right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, I'd better wait for His Majesty's official order before I take office! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson declined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although three requests and three speeches are not popular in the Alpha Kingdom, they still can't be too proactive in some periods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the power and responsibilities are not clearly defined in written documents, he will not take office to perform his duties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, Caesar IV's next order will not only include a breakdown of power and responsibilities, but also a promotion order for marshal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, I really can't hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, with the joint efforts of all parties, Caesar III suppressed his promotion as a marshal on the grounds of his \"ineffective supervision in the case of reselling military supplies\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Continental War broke out, and Hudson not only had to command the soldiers of the whole country, but after the kingdom officially intervened in the war, there was a high probability that he would also command the armies of allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't give a marshal position, and meet the marshal of the allies, let Hudson how to deal with himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't use the title of marshal given by the Principality of Moxi to make up for it, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson doesn't care, all the nobles in the kingdom can't afford to lose that man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Your Excellency, His Majesty's official order is already being written and will be issued later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You should familiarize yourself with the situation first, so that you can make adjustments to the Kingdom's next strategic deployment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the words of Grand Duke Afiero, Hudson nodded slightly. This is the way to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of \"commander in chief\" seems to be of high authority, but it is also accompanied by endless troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just coordinating the private armies of the nobles and nobles in the kingdom can make people collapse. If the full support of the government cannot be obtained, the follow-up work will not proceed at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, these should be the work of the Ministry of Military Affairs. It is easier to achieve a balance of power by separating the preparatory work before and after the war from the powers of the commanding general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the odds of winning this war are too low, and the results of repeated deduction by the Ministry of Military Affairs are not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maximize the combat effectiveness of the kingdom, the Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Effierro, took the initiative to propose the integration of forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to improve the military strength of the kingdom in the shortest possible time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

At present, the fleet is stationed on their overseas private island to rest and has not returned to the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family supervises their own island very closely, and our people can't penetrate it, so we can't understand the specific situation for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, judging from the funeral situation in the Dalton family territory, they really suffered heavy losses this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, the day when the Dalton family fleet goes to sea coincides with the time when our people enter the misty sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news of the siege of the ghost ship was fabricated by the Alpha people, then the loss of the Dalton family fleet is likely to be caused by our people fighting them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is unreasonable is that we have kept this trip strictly confidential, and our identity on the surface is a pirate. When fighting with pirates, there is no need for Alpha people to hide it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the way, Hudson also took part in the battle against the ghost ship with a dragon. According to the news announced by the Alpha Kingdom, they just repelled the ghost ship. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the team looking for the artifact, there are eight eighth-level powerhouses alone, more than twenty seventh-level powerhouses, and a large number of fifth-level and sixth-level experts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a lineup can go to slay dragons. If it appears on the battlefield, it can destroy some weak countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, as long as Josip and Jelacic don't kill themselves, they can't die. Even if the team disappeared, the people present did not think of the complete annihilation of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The pirate leader in charge of this mission is called Manbeard, he is a well-known pirate king, and his strength can be ranked among the top three in the pirate world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the help of our people, the strength will not be much weaker than the fleet of the Dalton family. Adding a dragon knight may suffer a small loss, but it will definitely not destroy the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I didn't get in touch with you, maybe the fleet got lost at sea, or maybe it was a loss from the battle with the Dalton family fleet and was forced to retreat into the foggy sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom ordered the blockade of the route. It is very likely that our people exposed their identities during the battle, which attracted the attention of the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this is the case, then we must arrange for someone to come over as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, the team will suffer heavy losses, and if they find the artifact and let the artifact fall into the hands of the Alphas, the consequences will be disastrous! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fact that they are so familiar with the situation is mainly due to Manbeard and the pirates, who are pawns secretly cultivated by the Judgment Knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to get some credit, when Bishop Yosip came to borrow someone, Blake pushed Manbeard out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the team suffered heavy losses, or even the entire army was wiped out, due to the lack of strength of the pirates, he would inevitably be held accountable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blake, it's easy for you to say. Although the sea power of the Alpha Kingdom is not very good, it is not paper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless we end up in person and send the main fleet over, we won't be able to deter them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the distance, even if our fleet goes to sea immediately and rushes there at the fastest speed, it will take a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that various accidents may occur at sea, it is not surprising even if it takes two or three months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was such a long delay on the road, and when our fleet rushed over, I am afraid there would not even be a chance to collect the corpse! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei replied angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All are real problems. The sea route in the extraordinary world is not so easy. Along the way, if you encounter high-level monsters or the residence of the Sea Clan, you have to make a detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the residence of these sea creatures is not fixed, and moving is a common thing. As a result, the current sea routes are also changing from time to time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that no one wants to solve the problem once and for all, but the ending is a bit embarrassing. After all, the sea is not a paradise for human beings. If you go to other people's territory to do things, you have to pay the price in blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The route cleared by force encirclement and suppression fell again under the counterattack of the Hai Clan not long after.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, people have the sea to rely on, fight if you win, and run if you can't win. If you want to pursue it, you have to be able to enter the water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how proficient in water warfare, human beings are also land creatures, and there is no way to survive in sea water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After tossing a few times, after paying a painful price. Everyone has learned how to make detours when it is time to detour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relationship between humans and the Sea Clan has always been bad. Even if they knew about each other's existence, they rarely communicated with each other. In the eyes of most humans, the Sea Clan is still a mysterious creature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the concept of \"Sea Clan\" was forcibly named by humans. In essence, all the races in the sea are playing on their own, and have not really been unified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally a large empire appears, but it can only rule a piece of sea area. Compared with the vast ocean, it is like a drop in the warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's easy to pick a thorn, but you came up with a solution?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether the rescue plan is feasible, the key is to take action. When it comes to politics, it often depends not only on the results, but also on the process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, the old enemy pointed out the loopholes in the rescue plan, which pushed him into an embarrassing situation at once. If he had known that something would happen to the team looking for the artifact, he wouldn't have gotten involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This matter is simple, we will send people directly to the Alpha Kingdom for a showdown, let them withdraw from the blockade, and release our people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is now in the period of the continental war, and the Alpha Kingdom is in a lot of troubles, and there is no leisure to intensify the conflicts with us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the one hand, they made the gesture of using force to solve the problem when the fleet went north; on the other hand, they resolved the problem through negotiation and consultation, and at worst provided them with a batch of strategic materials as compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Handling both soft and hard, as long as the news of the artifact is not leaked, there will be no major problems. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gu Lei said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, looking at the data in his hand, Hudson suddenly understood why the Ministry of Military Affairs urged him to come over and preside over the overall situation every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last war emptied the treasury of the Alpha Kingdom. In the past two or three years, most of them have been busy filling the shortfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The storage of various strategic materials is at an extremely low level. If the flames of war ignite, the kingdom can only reach out to nobles everywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the life of the nobles is not easy. The situation in the newly recovered provinces of northern Xinjiang was the worst, and every noble lord was struggling to make ends meet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several provinces affected by the war are currently recovering. Asking them to send troops is probably okay, but it is definitely hopeless to ask for money and food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have the ability to provide supplies to the kingdom are mainly the south-central provinces of the kingdom. How much material can be provided is still unknown, anyway, it is impossible to have more than the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom was able to fight fiercely with the orcs. In addition to fighting hard enough, the countries of the Human Race Alliance also acted as nurses behind the scenes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the countries on the mainland are caught in the flames of war, very few can provide strategic material support to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone takes the overall situation into consideration and can sell some strategic materials, the quantity cannot be too much, and the price is likely to fluctuate in the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars are fought over money and food. There is neither money nor food in the treasury. Even if the kingdom bites its teeth, it won't last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It must be done quickly!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this thought came to his mind, Hudson secretly scolded Duke Afiero for being treacherous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Ministry of Military Affairs dares to propose such a combat plan, it will definitely be sprayed with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little bit of military common sense knows that the style of quick battle is obviously more suitable for the strong against the weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the weaker side, facing the threat of the three major alien races, what confidence does the Alpha Kingdom have to fight quickly?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has to be done even if it is not sure. The situation is so bad that it is not surprising that the Ministry of Military Affairs requires the centralization of power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, you have thrown me a big trouble!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all people on the same boat, so it's definitely not okay to throw picks and rot. If he doesn't come up, someone else will preside over the overall situation. I don't know what will happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is no chance of winning, it is better to lose the kingdom's wealth in one's own hands than to follow others in a muddleheaded way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Hudson felt more and more that the Kingdom should sell the \"Scepter of Glory\". It is a pity that the royal family cannot agree, and the nobles in the country will most likely object.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to make such a suggestion, religious people can kill him. Everyone has prepared for countless years to set up a new branch, how can you just give up if you just give up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, the able ones should work harder! The current situation is indeed very complicated, but with your ability, you will definitely be able to find a way to break the situation!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archduke Afiero said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he had a choice, he would not give up the initiative. On the surface, such a choice was made for the sake of the overall situation, but in fact, they still did not want to bear the responsibility for the defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Principality of Omega has fallen, and the Principality of Shillong is also on the way to fall. The Kingdom of Light has lost more than half of its territory...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the overall performance of the seven grassland countries is very average, and it can even be said to be broken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adding up the time before and after, the Principality of Omega lasted for more than forty days, which is not as long as a strong fortress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Principality of Shillong is similar. Judging from the collected information, their outer city has been broken, and the entire country fell in the past few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no external force to join, perhaps within a year, the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie will be maimed or even destroyed by the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indications that the mainland countries do not support them very much. The current resistance of the seven grassland countries is only to give an explanation to the alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the Principality of Omega, you can tell that the nobles not only moved their family members ahead of time, even if they evacuated at the end, they took away 5,000 troops. How many troops did they have in total?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Shillong is also preserving its strength. Even though their king is about to fall, they still keep the most elite main army active outside, presumably to support the dignitaries to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same trick can only be used once. Orcs who have been fooled once will definitely learn from experience and lessons. There is a high probability that their breakout will not be smooth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The northern front is not optimistic, and the western battlefield is not much better. The performance of the Warhammer Kingdom can only be said to be slightly better than that of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may not be long before they will retreat to the mountains and hold on, and give up the Warhammer Great Plains, allowing the army of the ancient survivors to gallop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves are still just a rehearsal. If they also go off in person, the Duchy of Kantruo, Ustad, and Fick that are close to the Elven Forest may not be able to last for a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other countries in the Northern Continent are also unable to stop the advance of the elves. Perhaps within half a year, they will be able to penetrate a road leading to the Central Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is the ideal state. If the elves are determined to go south, it's no big deal to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that their goal is to occupy the entire northern continent, and they will list us as a key target, and attack us from three sides with the orcs and the ancient survivors, then it will be troublesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must show sincerity, no matter how much it costs, it must fool the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the battlefields across the mainland, we can see that the strength of the alien alliance is much stronger than everyone expected. At present, there is no battlefield, and the human race has established a victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among them, the support provided by the elves also played an important role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The background of the ancient overlords should not be underestimated. They are not like the orc empires that have broken their inheritance halfway. I very much doubt that there are still old antiques at the sanctuary level in the hands of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the records, the last strongman of our human race to break through the sanctuary was three hundred years ago, and other races in the mainland are estimated to be similar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lifespan of ordinary elves is not only three hundred years old, but the old antiques in the sanctuary have a thousand years of lifespan. It is impossible for them all to die, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Heroes come out of troubled times, and strong people are made by killing. Maybe it won't be long before new Sanctuary powerhouses will be born, but I don't know how many the Kingdom can produce! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson couldn't help but sigh with emotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Studying the history of the mainland, he was surprised to find that all the continental wars were times when the strong came out in large numbers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more brutal the war, the more powerful people will be born. Although many strong men fell on the battlefield, that was also the era of the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's a matter of the probability of a large base, or a matter of luck. In all previous wars, the number of strong people born in the human race was more than that of the alien race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of treatment has also happened to the previous mainland overlords, but it is not so obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there were no rumors in the kingdom, Hudson would have suspected that the previous continental wars were all launched by the old guy who was about to live to break through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, you have the final say on military matters. We are only responsible for assisting from the side, and all the information of the kingdom is open to you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The background of the elves has always been a mystery. It's not surprising that there are a few old antiques alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in the age of no saints, our human race still has four dragon knights to deter all directions. The eighth-level powerhouse holds a divine weapon, and can compete with ordinary sanctuary powerhouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, although the sanctuary of the human race has been missing, the strong with the power of the sanctuary level have never been cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation of the Alien Alliance is similar. Except for the orcs who were robbed of their inheritance artifacts by us, several other major alien races have artifact inheritance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister of Newfoundland explained verbally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, he mistakenly thought that Hudson was born in a humble background and didn't know much about the secrets of the mainland, so he carried out popular science in good faith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson has discovered these problems a long time ago. Even a cult organization like the Skull and Bones can use the \"Blood Moon Horn\" to make troubles. It makes no sense that the Orc Empire, as the overlord, has no background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they were forced to leave the prairie, they didn't use it. It wasn't that the orcs didn't want to use it, but that they simply didn't have any goods in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After consulting the information provided by the Principality of Moxi, Hudson knew that the orc empire had once broken its inheritance. Even the inherited artifacts were snatched away by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Moxi people have only a rough guess as to which major power is in the hands. According to the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, it seems that the Alpha Kingdom also got a share of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was not used on the bright side, either because the artifact was restricted and the human race could not use it; or because the kingdom was too close to the orcs, and they were worried about driving the orcs crazy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The problem of war, don't worry. Right now, let's solve the shortage of supplies first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weapons and armor from the last war can still be used, so everyone can prepare their own. However, strategic materials such as food, cloth, arrows, and fodder need to be prepared by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that at this time, strategic materials cannot be purchased in the international market, and even if they can be purchased, the price is beyond the ability of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the outside world can't count on it, it can only find a way to raise money by itself. Based on the analysis of the current situation, the flames of war will reach the Kingdom next year, and we don't have much time left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Please trouble the prime minister to urge all parties to prepare strategic materials as much as possible. This is my list of materials, which must be collected before the beginning of next spring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure is indeed a little higher, but the kingdom still has a lot of potential to be tapped. If the grain production capacity cannot be increased for a while, then find a way from other places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on mountains to eat mountains, relying on water to eat water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coastal nobles have a natural advantage, being able to go fishing. The sea is rich in aquatic products, and there is little human damage, so it is a rare treasure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not impossible to concentrate the power of the kingdom and raise 200,000 to 300,000 tons of dried fish a year as a meat supplement for the soldiers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson had already handed the list of supplies to the Grand Duke of Newfoundland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army can be trained by him, but money and food must be prepared by the government. Although the numbers on the list are huge, they are within everyone's ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At one time, Hudson wanted to propose: suspend maritime trade, and let all warships and merchant ships go out to sea for fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the problem of offending people, they simply took a roundabout way and directly customized a fishing mission for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He doesn't care how everyone completes the task. Anyway, when the kingdom's food production capacity is insufficient, dried fish is included in the military food system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain leaders can store thousands of tons of dried fish a year while meeting their own needs. There is no reason why other coastal nobles cannot do so.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about the overlord of the southeast coast like the Dalton family, as long as they are willing to work hard, it is not difficult at all to raise tens of thousands of tons of dried fish a year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, he also collects aquatic products. If the fish is not enough, kelp, dried shrimps, crabs and other seafood can also be used to make up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lack of oil and water, these foods may not be delicious. But in the war years, being able to fill the stomach is the greatest luck, and ordinary soldiers have no qualifications to be picky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of limited resources, in order to supplement the nutritional value of the soldiers, Hudson also tried his best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, I am afraid that there is no way to make up for such a large shortage of supplies in a short while. Especially the coastal provinces have been asked for a huge amount of fish goods. This...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for the Grand Duke of Newfoundland to refuse, Hudson interrupted directly: \"Your Excellency, no matter how difficult it is, you must gather the supplies. You can't let the soldiers go to the battlefield hungry, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The missions of several coastal provinces are heavy, so reduce the number of their recruits and leave the labor force for fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This task is only temporary. Notify the nobles in the coastal area to increase fishing efforts and store as much dried fish as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If logistical pressures increase in the future, there is a good chance that this number will continue to increase. As compensation, their serf soldiers will be the last recruits of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If all goes well, maybe there is no need to go to the battlefield. Others bleed on the front line, but they don't sweat too much in the rear, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to say something, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland swallowed it back. There are too many reasons why soldiers should not be allowed to go to the battlefield hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of who is replaced as the commander-in-chief, the soldiers must be fed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's request seems harsh, but in fact, after transporting the food and grass to the front line, it is not enough for the Royal Army to consume for ten months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the battle is fierce, maybe half a year can be finished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the material reserves of the last war, the material targets on the list are not half of the total material reserves of the kingdom before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to support a larger-scale war with such a small amount of supplies is **** mode no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you ask for a reduction in the total amount of supplies, the war will be impossible to fight. It is simply impossible to meet the needs of the frontline by raising materials during the war without stockpiling materials in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only difference is that the proportion of meat is higher, but it is mainly fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Alpha Kingdom, fish and meat can only be regarded as semi-meat food, not as oily as pork, beef, and mutton, and their status among the people is far inferior to that of pigs, beef, and sheep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the time is too short. If there are several years of preparation time, Hudson will definitely let everyone raise poultry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

After the internal discussion was completed, it was approved on the same day, and the next day it was made into an official document and sent to the provinces by the Griffin Cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if I am addicted to the \"Scepter of Glory\" and cannot extricate myself, or to give Hudson, the new Marshal, face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that the prime minister organized the results of the discussions into documents and sent them to the palace. Caesar IV signed them without even reading them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The new official took office three fires, Hudson is very clear that now is the time when the kingdom supports him the most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to promote new policies, or solve some \"difficult\" problems, now is the best time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is delayed until the middle and late stages of the war, and the strategic situation of the kingdom improves, it will be difficult to get everyone's full cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, I am not a reformer, and I have no intention of playing reform. All the efforts being made now are just to win this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking in the barracks, watching the soldiers training, Hudson frowned secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number of the standing army has returned to its peak state again, its combat effectiveness has dropped a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can tell autumn by seeing a leaf. If the standing army is like this, the private armies of nobles everywhere are not much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the time is too short. Ordinary soldiers are easy to replenish, but practitioners cannot be cultivated all at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did the number of knights decrease, but the general strength also declined compared to before the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this has something to do with the military instructors sent by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to enhance the military strength of the human race in the northern continent, the Alpha Kingdom has successively dispatched thousands of noble knights to various countries to help them complete military mobilization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a price that must be paid. The stronger the resistance of the countries and the longer they persist, the more beneficial it will be to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to Hudson's \"North first, then West\" strategy, the countries of the Northern Continent must persist until the Alpha Kingdom defeats the orc army before they can receive strong support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, they are directly subject to abandonment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, who made the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie start up, and they are unable to provide enough strategic materials to support the army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the quartermaster of the last war, Hudson calculated that if the orcs were blocked from the prairie and the orcs were sent to the door for a decisive battle, the strategic materials consumed by an army of the same strength would be three times different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still the most optimistic estimate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the kingdom's army are ordinary people, and their combat effectiveness is not comparable to the elite reinforcements of the Terran Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not so easy to block the orcs in the remote mountains. If the enemy is allowed to rush out to attack the logistics, the material loss will be even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that there is no quick fix. Once the situation is unfavorable, the enemy can retreat at any time, which is easy to form a tug of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pessimistically estimated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining military strength of the Orc Empire is still higher than that of the Kingdom, and running to block the door is a thousand miles away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this background, the abandonment of the Seven Prairie Kingdoms became inevitable. At least fight at the door of the house, even if the situation is unfavorable, you can rely on the defense line to stabilize your position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't participated in it personally, it was certain that the Orc Empire had been hit hard, and Hudson wouldn't have dared to formulate such an \"aggressive\" strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the kingdom's mobilization sequence, the southeastern province responsible for logistics has always been at the back. Now that the task of fishing has been added, the mobilization sequence is even further behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rules are rules, and Hudson will not break them. This means that in the early stage of the war, he had no direct armed forces in his hands, and the only thing he could rely on was the kingdom's standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lunch time, looking at the table full of delicacies, Hudson did not rush to move the knife and fork, but smiled at everyone and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"All of you here are familiar faces, maybe I can't name each of you, but you must know me.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having worked together, you should know my style of doing things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the days to come, I hope that any military order can be implemented unconditionally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As you know, I don't like to make an example of others. But if something goes wrong, my sword will still kill!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference from last time is that the situation in the kingdom is much more dangerous now than last time, so my requirements for you are also much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From now on, please ignore your background in the military camp. You don't need an introduction, and I don't want to know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what your identity is, anyone who violates the military law will be killed without mercy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Saying the most ruthless words in the gentlest tone, everyone's expressions changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, Hudson, the coach, was still rushing to the shelves, and his prestige in the army was not very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The means of dealing with problems must also pay more attention to skills and means. As long as it is not a matter of principle, it is rarely pursued in depth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the indulgence of his coach, there would not be a case of reselling military supplies that caused a sensation in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation has changed. Hudson, who has greatly improved both in prestige and status, no longer needs so many scruples in dealing with problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, if you talk about killing people, it means you can really kill people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, Marshal, we will fully cooperate!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James immediately expressed his opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the deputy commanders of the army, after Hudson voluntarily retreated, he successfully got the position of commander of the standing army after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking office, he also did his best and won the approval of Caesar IV. Originally thought that this would lead to the peak, but I didn't expect that once the continental war broke out, Hudson would eventually become the leader of the military.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be some people who are not reconciled, but most of them are relieved. The current situation on the mainland is quite unfavorable to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, before this, Caesar IV also asked him if he intended to come out to compete for the position of coach. After hesitating again and again, James still gave up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to Hudson, everyone knows: Dragon Knight, the famous general of the mainland; when it comes to him, Marquis James, people in the country don't know who it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The record cannot be matched, and the gap in reputation is even worse. The gap between the two sides is too large, and the king's support is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, Caesar IV's military accomplishments are well known. His opinion may seem important, but in fact the possibility of everyone buying it is very low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Join if you can't beat, the position of coach can't be won, and the position of deputy coach is also very good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is not the era of Caesar III. The king can directly appoint the deputy commander. At this moment, James wants to get the position of deputy commander, and Hudson's opinion cannot be avoided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many nobles in the country who are qualified to participate in the competition, and Marquis James does not have an advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he is the commander-in-chief of the standing army, since Hudson entered the barracks, his commander-in-chief has become dispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the reactions of the generals, we can see that most of the generals don't mind Hudson seizing power as soon as he comes up. Who made most of these generals be promoted by Hudson before?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom, with the military merit system as its political core, has always followed the principle of who can beat whoever is superior. Even if James wants to cultivate cronies, there is little room for manipulation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It would be the best if everyone can cooperate. They all came down from the battlefield together, and no one wants to get to that step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I ate breakfast late and am not hungry yet. If you are hungry, eat first!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not hungry, go to the camp with me to see the meals of the grassroots officers and soldiers. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice fell, Hudson got up and walked out the door without giving anyone a chance to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, everyone followed with winks. It's just that there are a few military officers in charge of logistics, and their faces are obviously a little unnatural.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any closed system is a breeding ground for corruption, and the military is no exception.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about the treatment of noble officers, even the lowest noble knights have received matching treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deducting the meals of noble officers, the Alpha Kingdom has no such warriors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to do something, it is aimed at ordinary soldiers, at most up to the level of ten commanders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the soldiers eat mashed potatoes, gnaw on black bread, and drink vegetable soup with floating diced meat, Hudson returned to the dining room without saying a word.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to read on. From the perspective of food standards, it is almost the same as the prescribed treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the happy smiles on the faces of the soldiers still exposed the essence of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what kind of food, as long as you eat it every day, you will never have this expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to provide food according to the standard is obviously because he came to inspect the camp today. In front of the leader, you must show it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't care about the past. But in the future, the soldiers' food standard will increase by 0.5 pounds of meat per person per day on the basis of today.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The increased meat, I will ask the Ministry of Military Affairs to allocate it to you later. If the military expenditure is not enough, it will be deducted from the food standard of our high-level officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With one month as the deadline, I will take care of everyone's health first, and after one month I will train the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the soldiers' bodies can't keep up, then someone needs to be held accountable. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson reached out and tore off the thigh of a snow rabbit, and started to eat it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary military officers didn't change much on their faces, and started to eat right away, but the faces of the people in charge of military supplies were flushed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words not only puncture the window of corruption, but if the budget is not well controlled, it may even be poured into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Deducted from the food standard of high-level officers\", everyone knows this is a joke. If you really dare to do it like this, you don't have to hang out in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a weak commander dares to cut off their financial resources, he will definitely let the coach know who is in charge of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who doesn't have a lot of backgrounds to be able to serve as a fat job like a quartermaster?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if it is to make money, it is not just a few points from them, most of them are taken away by the people behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I can only think about it now, confronting Hudson openly, no one wants to be \"the chicken that was killed\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vaguely, Hudson also noticed that Marquis James frowned. I don't know if he also participated in the distribution, or if he was dissatisfied and directly punctured the window paper, not saving him face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, these things seem to be problems with military supplies, but they actually reflect the laxness of the commander in charge of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if he didn't see all this, Hudson said to himself: \"Since everyone has no opinion, let's implement it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis James, you are in charge of overseeing the implementation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone doesn't cooperate, it would be too cruel to ransack the house and exterminate the family, but dealing with a branch, I think everyone can accept it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Threats, naked threats!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general corruption cases, the stolen money is recovered, a fine is imposed, and the person is driven home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the circumstances are a little more serious, in addition to the above punishments, an exile to the border will be added.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only in particularly serious cases will the heads fall to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: The five Dukes of the Northland in the last war, because of corruption and reselling military supplies, the amount of military supplies was too large, so they couldn't close the scene, so they could only end it with their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Connecting a branch to a branch is already similar to the way of colluding with other races and betraying the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that Hudson is trying to make trouble and label it as a stigma, insisting on linking corruption of military funds with collusion with aliens and betraying the interests of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he did something a little out of line, he directly put the matter on the bright side, and everyone was speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is to win the war, not for personal gain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that it is only a request for soldiers' food, but it is actually a warning to the entire logistics system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, don't worry, I will personally supervise this matter.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    James Marquis replied boldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't think Hudson was really asking for advice, and the beatings one after another were obviously warning him to keep quiet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he already had an ominous premonition. His intuition told him that Hudson would never let it go, and there must be big moves next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A commander who doesn't do anything is not a good commander. When he himself took charge of the standing army, he used political means to exclude dissidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Failed to hold the standing army in his hands, mainly because there were too many interest groups in the army, and his own prestige was not enough to overwhelm all parties, so he could only seek balance through compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In peaceful times, it is no problem to play like this. It will be different in war time. What is needed in the military is order and prohibition, and there is no need for so many different voices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the whole kingdom acquiesces to Hudson's action. Most of the noble officers in the army have received warnings from their families. It cannot be said that there are no ones who dare to commit crimes, but the number will definitely not be many.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Holy See, Ulisse was worrying about the information in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through the information collected from all parties, it all shows that the team sent by the Holy See to find the artifact is now cool.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are a small number of survivors trapped on Dulong Island, there is a high probability that they will not survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of other factors, the Dulong Island is full of poisons, and the air is filled with the smell of toxins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Water and food are two fatal problems. If you are not careful, you will be poisoned and die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing many masters at once, the Holy See, who has a big family and a big business, can't afford it. If you come here a few more times, no matter how solid your background is, it will be exhausted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After paying such a high price, there was no trace of the artifact, and the only gain was the collection of bits and pieces of information.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Kevin, are you sure that the artifact we were looking for fell into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Scepter of Glory\" and the \"Holy Sword of Light\" are too involved, and the Holy See has no possibility of giving up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Alpha Kingdom is also a concentration camp for heretics, and there are anti-Holy sees all over the place. It is almost impossible to get things back by peaceful means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, how can there be any accurate information on this kind of thing. Most of the information we have collected is hearsay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha people have blocked the news very strictly. The fleet of the Dalton family has not returned to the mainland so far. We have no chance to get in if we want to verify the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the news that the previous artifact is on Dulong Island, it is only a possibility. Similar possibilities have happened countless times in the past, and all the rumors have finally been confirmed to be false! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin replied with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the artifact is in the hands of Kingdom Alpha, they won't reveal it! With the bad relationship between the two parties, it is impossible to verify it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If things cannot be determined, then the situation is a bit bad!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news that the Scepter of Glory and the Holy Sword of Light are wandering outside cannot be spread at all. Even if it is really in the hands of the Alpha Kingdom, we cannot directly come to ask for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a big matter, and it cannot be done by our intelligence department alone. Make a decision after reporting to His Majesty the Pope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin, you have a big task ahead. It is necessary to find out whether the scepter of glory and the holy sword of light are in the hands of the Alpha in the shortest possible time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse said with a solemn expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he is only in charge of collecting intelligence from the Holy See, he also knows a little bit about political matters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the scepter of glory and the holy sword of light are lost or not, the Holy See must firmly insist that nothing is lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Alpha man dangles the artifact in front of them, it must be a fake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This means that if they want to **** the artifact, they can only do it secretly, and they even need to \"dispel the rumors!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Secretly snatching an artifact from a kingdom, one can imagine how risky it is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is not only one artifact, what they want is the scepter of glory and the holy sword of light, and the others are not the targets of looting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't figure out the matter, if the Alpha people get a side artifact that can only be seen but not used, it won't be worth spending a lot of money to **** it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar cases have never happened before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Break your head to grab the artifact, and finally find out that it is an exclusive artifact of a special race, and only people of this race can drive it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the period of the Continental War, and the most taboo thing is to cause extra problems. Before you are sure, it is just asking for trouble if you take the initiative to attack a big country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a commotion, it will trigger the intervention of the Terran Alliance, and will make the international situation of the Holy See even more embarrassing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Please rest assured, my lord, as soon as the Dalton family's fleet returns to the mainland, we will immediately send people to verify the authenticity of the rumors!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kevin immediately promised.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it weren't for Hudson handling military affairs in the capital, he would probably be a member of the coalition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He, the dragon knight, is absent, and the Koslow family, which doesn't even have a navy fleet, is naturally not qualified to participate in this kind of public welfare game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as Hudson knows, the dark masters in the kingdom have rushed over one after another, wanting to get a share of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the major forces, there are not many eighth-level powerhouses of the dark system, but there are not a few masters of the fifth-level, sixth-level, and seventh-level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a rare encounter with an eighth-order ghost ship, which is a risk for ordinary people, but it is a rare opportunity for these dark-type powerhouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is the core of the ghost ship, without their share, the soul orbs left after the ghost is destroyed are also great supplements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Greed is the original sin. When the benefits reach a certain level, people will ignore the risks. Dark system cultivators are particularly persistent in this aspect, and it is nothing at all to take a little risk in order to chase power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Counting the days, it's time for the coalition forces to start. If it continues to drag on, after the news spreads, dark-type powerhouses from all over the mainland will flock to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one will give up the opportunity to break through the sanctuary. At that time, it will definitely be a battle between dragons and tigers. The best choice is to rush to get the core before everyone arrives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether you can break through the sanctuary smoothly, as long as you use the things, the trouble will be gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they have calculated everything, and they didn't expect Hudson, an irrelevant dragon knight, to cut off his beard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While everyone was busy looking for the ghost ship, Hudson had already found the target first under the guidance of the ghost slave in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strongest fortresses are broken from within. Relying on the guidance of the ghost spy in his hand, Hudson successfully hit the sap of the two ghost kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the remaining ghost king rose up to resist, he couldn't afford to toss the waves at all in the face of the pincer attack of the dragon and the bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After failing to coerce and lure, the three ghost kings were finally forced to sign a slave contract. Of course, the signing object is not Hudson, but Bear Stearns and Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rough methods must have backlash, but under the absolute power gap, even if the three ghost kings want to rebel, they have to wait until they break through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson looks down on them, it's because the promotion of these alien beings is too bumpy. Throughout the history of the human race, there are only a handful of scenes where sanctuary-level ghost ships appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can break through the sanctuary, Bear Stearns and Maxim, who are more talented, will not wait for them where they are, and there is almost no possibility of surpassing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Controlling the ghost king is equivalent to controlling the ghost ship. Instead of letting them continue their activities outside, they were ordered to go to the Misty Sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having caused such a big disturbance, it is time to avoid the limelight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how powerful the encirclement and suppression fleet is, they have to be caught blind in the face of the vast fog. It just happened to be able to watch Dulong Island, and not give the fish that slipped through the net a chance to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the lord's mansion, little Franz, who is more than one year old, can already climb around with small steps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of his son, many dangerous facilities in the Lord's Mansion have been given special treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pond was added with a temporary guardrail, the rockery was worn away, and the well was covered...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The degree of caution was so high that Hudson was speechless. You must know that the little guy has been taken care of by maids in shifts day and night since he was born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If accidents can happen, it would seem that he, the lord, is too useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since ancient times, when the head of the family was strong, accidents rarely happened to the descendants. Many children died young, most of them were due to internal struggles in the backyard, and only a few were due to congenital deficiencies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's status is in full swing, and all branches are very peaceful. The Koslow family has not yet developed to the point where it needs internal fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that he was inexperienced in raising a child for the first time, he simply let Melissa torment her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that this is the experience provided by Master Redman, but Hudson can be sure that his brothers absolutely did not have this kind of treatment when they grew up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Franz was not young, Hudson would definitely have removed the maids around him. Every day a group of maids followed him. Wouldn't it be a tragedy if he became Jia Baoyu?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But such good days are destined to be short-lived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the children of great nobles should be able to read and write from the age of three, and they should undergo basic knight training from the age of five.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bow and horse riding and archery, aristocratic etiquette, dealing with people, humanities and history...Everything needs to be arranged at this age, and when you are older, you will be exposed to politics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Comparatively speaking, the children of the aristocrats of the Alpha Kingdom learn slightly less things, and the children of the central and southern aristocrats also need to learn art.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, next you will be stationed in the capital, do you want to bring me and Franz?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting Melissa's resentful eyes, Hudson didn't know how to answer for a while. After hesitating for a while, he said slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The next king's capital will be a gathering place for wind and cloud, and it may be rare to find peace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the situation deteriorates and the mountainous territory is located in a remote location, we can still close our doors and defend ourselves. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all true words, and Hudson has no confidence in winning this war. In essence, whether the Alpha Kingdom can win or not depends on the choice of the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they devote all their efforts to the war, the countries along the way will not be able to stop them at all. At that time, even the Alpha Kingdom at its peak will not be able to fight on the third front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, there is no force on the mainland that can withstand the joint siege of the elves, orcs, and ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's strategy for the kingdom is entirely based on the enemy coming one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be a desperate battle, but in fact it is more of an international game. The bet is that the elves do not have the determination to destroy the Alpha Kingdom at any cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is so serious, the outside world is not saying...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Halfway through her words, Melissa suddenly swallowed back. Compared with outside rumors, she obviously believed in Hudson's judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yi was pregnant and stupid for three years. Since the birth of little Franz, she has concentrated most of her energy on her son, and she has seldom cared about political issues.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the mountainous territory is far away from the political center, and all the energies of the lord's mansion are devoted to farming, and there is no time to care about the international political situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is also the limitation of talent origin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, those who are serving in the mountainous area are all descendants of minor nobles. They have developed their abilities through acquired training, but their vision and thinking have not changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics in the eyes of the little aristocrats is the one-acre three-point land in front of their own house. Basically, it is only at the county level. If they can consider the provinces, they have a vision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"International politics\" spread to their ears, it was all hearsay news, far from the truth, and it was simply out of reach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Habits developed for a long time, subconsciously believe that international politics has nothing to do with oneself, which determines that everyone prefers to talk about things around them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is also happy to see this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for your subordinates, it's better to be a laborer with peace of mind than anything else. If you think too much, you won't be able to keep people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at the pictures you usually make for everyone. If someone really wants to go out and start his own family, Master Hudson will also feel uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cultivating a talent is not easy. If everyone is restless and doesn't want to shine for the construction of the territory, and run out to start a business one after another, who will work for him?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really broaden your horizons, the children of the nobles will find that it is far less cost-effective to go to the king if you want to make contributions and hang out with the big nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, even going to the north to fight hard is more promising than staying in the mountainous territory to farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, risks and benefits are equal. The north has more opportunities, but also faces higher risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, civilians have the opportunity to rise to power, but that's just a theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other times, Hudson didn't know that the last time the orcs invaded the Middle Kingdom, a total of more than two million people were mobilized. In the end, only seven civilians became nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is embarrassing is that the seven role models carefully set up by the kingdom are either the distant relatives of the minor nobles, or the descendants of the declining nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach of the army, Hudson can guarantee that no one will cheat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, these seven lucky people want to operate, and they don't have enough connections to operate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, these seven lucky ones are grassroots. Apart from reading a few books with their parents and gaining a little knowledge, they are no different from ordinary people, and they have not even completed the basic training of knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The probability of success is so low, it is completely caused by the power, information, and resources in the hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading a private army to the battlefield to seek military exploits, and a lonely family leading the weapons issued by the kingdom as cannon fodder, the starting point gap is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most reliable way is to follow a certain nobleman for several generations, accumulate enough connections and resources, get a noble title, and then seek fiefdoms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the route planned by the great nobles for ordinary people. It seems simple and clear, but in fact it is a big cake that can be seen and cannot be touched.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transition time in the middle is so long, the children of the next generation will either not go to school, as long as they go to the hall arranged by the noble master, they will inevitably be brainwashed and educated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including Hudson himself, if it weren't for the five hundred private troops who started that year, it would be difficult to cross the initial threshold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crueler the truth, the more it is necessary to paint a picture, so that everyone can see that there is hope in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson, who has a conscience, has promised everyone that as long as he \"performs well\" at work, he will definitely be able to solve the noble treatment before retirement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is limited to false titles, and not every manager has one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to obtain a fiefdom, you must make great contributions. There is no specific standard for the time being, and it will definitely not be low anyway. Who told this to cut flesh from the lord's own territory?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to stabilize people's hearts, we should not let everyone's thinking be too active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, it would be difficult for everyone to work with peace of mind if they heard that so-and-so was awarded the title of knighthood today, and heard that so-and-so became a nobleman tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter how low the probability is, when the base is large enough, there will be no shortage of winners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the management in the Mountain Territory is more or less basic, and the starting conditions are much better than those of pure grassroots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you experience too much baptism of success messages, it is easy to have the illusion that I can do it if I do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the exact opposite of the policy Hudson is about to implement in the kingdom's standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary soldiers, even if there are no grassroots heroes, he will artificially create a few lucky ones.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a few stimuli are not enough, then dozens or hundreds, so that role models will continue to appear around everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the kingdom pays the bill, and there is no need to cut meat from its own territory. It doesn't matter if you have a bunch of little nobles, the game is eager for quick success.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single thought of a great person is often a change of fate for ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Hudson seemed to realize something, and his whole body was immersed in it, but this state was fleeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But from the envious eyes of a dragon and a bear beside him, he knew that this must be something extraordinary. It's a pity that the current level of cultivation is too shallow to grasp such lofty things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, what happened just now, why did Bear Stearns suddenly release the protective barrier, and even I was stopped outside?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melissa asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have a little comprehension in terms of cultivation, don't worry, this is a good thing.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson gave Bear Stearns an approving look.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft with sharp eyesight are different. If they were disturbed and missed this opportunity, Hudson would regret it to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the comprehension time only lasted less than a quarter of an hour, but his intuition told him that this moment saved him a lot of training time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dragon God above, this is unreasonable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A sixth-level great magician actually began to comprehend the law. Human talent is so against the sky, can you let the dragon live? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim said with a depressed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen from the expression that he is very unhappy now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Starting to comprehend the rules, even if it is only a little superficial, it means that Hudson has a high probability of breaking through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The career of a migrant worker will be extended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally thought that after fulfilling the contract obligations in 180 years, he could live the life of a free dragon again, but now it seems that his thinking is too simple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No time to pay attention to Maxim's thoughts, Hudson only has two words \"law\" left in his mind at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from gifted races such as giant dragons, their innate supernatural powers have their own laws, and they can easily break through the sanctuary after they reach adulthood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Humans need to understand the laws themselves if they want to break through the sanctuary. No one can tell exactly how to comprehend it, and how much it needs to be comprehended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to know the \"law\" is the result of Hudson's erudition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The growth path of each sanctuary powerhouse is different, and the laws they comprehend are also different. If you insist on summing up experience, that is due to your talent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the information in Hudson's hands, and the specific description of the law, are very vague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At first, he thought that someone was hiding it on purpose, but now it seems that those sanctuary powerhouses are in the same state as he is now, and he doesn't know what he has comprehended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can figure it out, you may reach a higher level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, Maxim, how much do you know about the laws?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Human beings have a limited lifespan, and it is very difficult to break through the sanctuary, and the probability of being able to enter a higher level is even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, these long-lived races are still more dominant, and they have a long time to study slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let me tell you, there are many kinds of laws, mainly: earth, fire, wind, water, light, darkness, and thunder, and they are the easiest to comprehend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The six laws of fate, destruction, death, life, time, and space are relatively few understood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also some special ones such as: the law of the dragon, the law of the blood... They are all born with it, basically it has nothing to do with us humans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the cultivation system is, understanding the laws is indispensable if you want to break through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific rule subdivision, you should study it after the Sanctuary!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The comprehension just now was purely accidental. Don't regard chance as ability. Knowing too much now is of no benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not in the realm, it is easy to take random thoughts as laws and comprehend them, and if you are not careful, you will go astray. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns' tone as someone who had experienced it left Hudson speechless. Obviously I grew up by my bloodline talent, but I still act like I have a lot of experience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Bear Stearns also has reasons for arrogance. It is true that Sanctuary Warcraft can possess the strength of Sanctuary as an adult, but the specific time is uncertain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some sanctuary monsters possess sanctuary-level strength right after they reach adulthood;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before they are digested and absorbed, they can only be regarded as pseudo sanctuaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same problem also exists among the giant dragons. After all, no matter how talented a race is, it is inevitable that a few waste materials will be born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not a few dragons who spend hundreds or even thousands of years digesting their realm after they reach adulthood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, relying on the strength of their own talents, the dragons at the pseudo-sacred level are still stronger than ordinary human sanctuaries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is without external force. Human bodies are far inferior to Warcraft, but humans like to use tools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the holy sword of light in Hudson's hand is a good auxiliary weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the knights in the sanctuary held artifacts in their hands, it would be possible to slay dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, don't listen to Bear Stearns bullshit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What you just comprehended is a bit like the law of fate, what the Earth Bears comprehend is almost all the laws of the earth system, and no strong man of the fate system has ever been born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many records in his inheritance memory about the law of destiny! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of the number of strong people born, there is no race in the continent of Aslant that can compare with the dragon race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Bears of the Earth are good, they are quite partial students. There are a lot of earth-type powerhouses, but for the study of other laws, it depends on how many different types of bears they have born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No matter how few records there are, they are better than your dragon who has no inheritance memory!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It all depends on the mother dragon to give you the knowledge. I don't believe that she is so conscientious and entrusts you with all the inherited memories? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, who failed to pretend, immediately retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is quite experienced in this area. Bear Stearns has a deep understanding of how irresponsible his mother bear is. He doesn't believe how diligent the mother of dragons is.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe because he was stepped on and had a sore foot, the flushed Maxim glared at the cub. If it wasn't for the fact that he had lost too many times before and had no confidence in his heart, he would have gone to invite the battle at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, you are all dragons and bears with status, pay attention to my image.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the scene was about to get out of control, Hudson, who was watching the excitement, took advantage of the situation and gave both sides a step up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar quarrels will come every now and then. At the beginning, he tried to resolve the conflict, but later found that it was useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more mediation is carried out, the more trouble the two sides will have, and in the end they just don't bother to pay attention to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it was noisy, and it only took a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the situation gets out of control, Hudson will come out and pass the steps to both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really unclear, so according to the prevailing rules in the mainland, whoever has the biggest fist is right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting is not without benefits, at least the fighting experience of the dragon and the bear is increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After staying at home for three days, Hudson came to the capital again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles from all over the country have basically arrived, and even the daily communication activities have increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the banquets held by the court nobles, Hudson can not buy it at all, and now all the real power factions of the kingdom are here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to be cannon fodder, the local aristocratic lord wants to establish a good relationship with him as the coach; Hudson needs everyone to cooperate closely on the battlefield, and also needs to handle the relationship well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the five Dukes of the Northland who have not dealt with it very much, now they meet like friends who haven't seen for many years. As for the previous contradiction, it seems to have disappeared with the wind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's going on in your heart, no one knows. On the surface, everyone has already implanted the theme of \"unity\" into every word and deed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the coach, Hudson is talking about people and talking nonsense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it didn't happen, he wouldn't know he was so sociable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After taking a day off from work, I suddenly found that the group exploded. In other words, this is the first time, Haiyue can't remember, the new group is online.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I will make up for the owed updates as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally ask for a ticket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

However, the situation on the battlefield continued to deteriorate, and a series of bad news came, making everyone breathless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the fall of the Principality of Omega, the Principality of Shillong followed suit, with only three days between the two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who will be the next unlucky guy depends entirely on the mood of the orcs. The Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland has been a joke from beginning to end. From the outbreak of the war to the present, it has not achieved a brilliant record.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom in the west is now also being beaten dizzily by the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, and the front line is repeatedly retreating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi and the Principality of Orton hadn't sent troops in time to help them stabilize their position for their own safety, the situation might have collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the Alpha Kingdom also contributed, and the promised 10,000 reinforcements arrived on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, on the battlefield where millions of troops have been assembled on both sides, the mere reinforcement of 10,000 ordinary troops, apart from bringing spiritual support, cannot influence the trend of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bad news is far more than these. The trend of the war in the central part of the mainland is not as optimistic as everyone expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race does have an advantage, but this war has reached a critical moment for the alien alliance, and all races are desperately fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the countries of the human race have scruples, and they all want to win at the least cost, and they are unwilling to compromise their own strength too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially those wars jointly initiated by several countries, they all want to make others contribute more, and their performance on the battlefield is particularly eye-catching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War fights morale, money and food, and more importantly, the determination to move forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side fights for the survival of the race, while the other fights for interests. Different starting points determine how much the two sides invest in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is clear that the human race has an absolute advantage in strength, but they can only keep entangled with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war has reached a stalemate, which has little impact on the countries in Central and South China. Anyway, they can grind the enemy to death with their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the current style of play, not only can the strength be preserved as much as possible, but also an elite army can be trained by war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The future is the age of the extraordinary army, but not yet. You have seen the serf soldiers in the Alpha Kingdom before, and when the number reaches a certain level, they can also play a big role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the loss of the main army, countries in the mainland have recruited serf soldiers to join the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no shame in learning from each other. Compared with the main army, these cannon fodder troops are indeed inferior in combat effectiveness, but they are cheaper!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just in this way, it will hurt the countries of the Northern Continent. Everyone is busy with their own wars, and the countries of the Northern Continent can only fight alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Worse than bad news is bad news after bad news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just when everyone was about to discuss the issue of artifacts, bad news came from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The negotiations with the elves failed, and the other party refused to sign a non-aggression treaty with the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pressure was all transmitted together, and the atmosphere in the palace was terribly depressed, like the last calm before the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is taking a turn for the worse, and the worst situation is about to happen. If you have any ideas, please tell me!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV pretended to be calm and said. It was just the trembling of his body, which still exposed his inner anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glancing at the ministers, he became more and more anxious when he saw the same anxious royals and nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A king is a king because a kingdom exists. If the Alpha Kingdom is gone, he, the high king, is nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hudson again, Caesar IV's mentality has changed drastically. It used to be that Hudson was so unhappy, but now he is so pleasing to the eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Caesar IV hid the message in his eyes, and Hudson didn't understand it. He was busy deducing the future development of the situation in his mind at the moment, and didn't care about the king's thoughts at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the international situation is taking a turn for the worse and cannot be controlled by manpower. The most important thing for us now is to stabilize people's hearts and not mess up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom does not have the ability to take care of multiple battlefields at the same time, nor does the North Continent have the ability to face the three major alien races at the same time, but it does not mean that we have no power to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves didn't send troops, so just ignore them. The most important thing right now is to persuade the countries of the Northern Continent to send troops to reinforce the Warhammer Kingdom, and help them block the coalition forces of the ancient survivors first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our next strategy is to deal with the Orc Empire first. If the elves participate in the war, let the countries shrink strategically and let go of a road to the south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, they also need to strengthen their ties with the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland. They cannot stop the orcs' soldiers, but the army in their hands is also a considerable force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, it is best to persuade the governments of the seven countries to withdraw the remaining military forces into the kingdom after the land falls. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, calmly analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapse of the situation cannot be stopped, but it is still possible to use the collapsed situation to increase the strength of the kingdom as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows what the specific effect will be. But in this situation, it would be nice to be able to come up with a solution. How can we expect a perfect solution to the problem?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, each country in the Northern Continent has its own ideas, and they may not accept our proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to sending troops to reinforce the Warhammer Kingdom, they are more willing to close the country and defend themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mutual trust between countries was lost as early as the last orc invasion. Our suggestion at this time is likely to be considered by them as the kingdom's revenge for their previous inaction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the formation of coalition forces, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs communicated with them many times. Except for a few border countries who agreed, the rest of the countries required the kingdom to send no less than 500,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You know that the kingdom cannot divide its troops now. If 500,000 troops are dispatched to the west, then the next battlefield in northern Xinjiang can only be passively beaten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that even if we form a coalition, we can't block the elves on the western front at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two fronts are passively attacked, even if the human race wins this war, the kingdom will fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other side of the seven grassland countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can only do its best to do its work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are supporters behind these countries. If they want them to act according to our plan, they must convince the major forces in the mainland. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The words of Earl Francis were like pouring a basin of cold water on everyone, shattering all their illusions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A strategy that is in line with the interests of the Alpha Kingdom does not mean that it is also in line with the interests of the countries of the Northern Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has selfishness, it is impossible for everyone to abandon their own interests for the benefit of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries requesting the Alpha Kingdom to divide their troops is essentially for self-protection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that after the division of troops, the two fronts cannot be maintained, but everyone doesn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the coalition forces can hold back the pace of the elves' attack until the end of the continental war, they will have the possibility to keep their foundation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It really doesn't work. It is also a good choice to find an opportunity to negotiate with the elves after a few victories and strive for a decent ending.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the life and death of the Alpha Kingdom, I can't even care about it. Who has the time to care about allies?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie is even simpler.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foundation has been ruined. If you don't bring your remaining strength to prepare for the restoration of the country, you come to help the Alpha Kingdom desperately. What are you planning?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, there is only one large port on the prairie, and the evacuation capabilities of various countries are limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not completely unnegotiable to allow the armed forces that cannot evacuate in time to temporarily retreat into the Alpha Kingdom to continue resisting the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland are easy to solve. With the deterioration of the battlefield situation, they have only two choices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either evacuate from the sea, or retreat all the way into the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, there have been constant storms at sea, and there are still ghost ships on the way. The risk of ships going south is very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarified the relationship with them, and I think they can understand it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Albert said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Seven Prairie Kingdoms evacuated from the sea, and they also needed to pass through the sphere of influence of the Alpha Kingdom. Once the kingdom blocks the sea route, the sea line of communication is cut off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that this approach pulls the lower limit too low. No matter how you find an excuse to cover it up, it will seriously damage the kingdom's international image.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the fact that the fief was at the northernmost point, the first victim would be the first victim when the flames of war ignited, and he would not have made such a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Earl Albert's proposal is very pertinent. There have been constant storms at sea recently. As an ally, we have the obligation to remind the Seven Prairie Nations to sail carefully.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Earl of Oran on the side followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, all the great nobles in northern Xinjiang responded. International image is a matter of the future, but the orc threat is just around the corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't want to find a way to gather a batch of cannon fodder. In the next big war, they, the northern border lords who are \"responsible for defending the land\", will definitely suffer a big loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, some people wanted to object, but considering that during the war, someone must be the cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to let the troops of the seven grassland countries be cannon fodder than to let their own people go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pass the first one, you will not miss the second one. Anyway, the integrity has fallen, and everyone doesn't mind pulling down the bottom line a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armed forces of the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland will be withdrawn, and the people will naturally not be able to stay where they are and be killed by the orcs, so they will simply take over them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happened that the Alpha Kingdom needed to replenish its population, and there were large tracts of land waiting to be reclaimed in the territories of the new nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this kind of thing, you don't need to say it out. The external rhetoric is only one \"accepting refugees\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether these refugees should be returned after the war, and how much should be returned, it all depends on everyone's integrity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone's bottom line is falling all the way, Hudson is very speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to obtain enough population during the retreat from the seven grassland countries. It's just that judging from the current situation, there are too many people who are eyeing this piece of fat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't formulate a rule and let everyone play freely, he, the lord of the southern border, can't compete with the local snake in the north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no problem in gathering the power of the Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie, but we must be cautious in the implementation process, preferably in the name of helping them restore the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past practice, after the Continental War ends, the countries that sacrificed for the war will be re-established even if they have been destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the most powerful country in the northern continent, the kingdom has a great say in the reestablishment of the country in the northern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the biggest bargaining chip in our hands and we must use it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only the Seven Grassland Countries, other countries in the Northern Continent can also be included in the scope of public relations, trying to persuade as many countries as possible to form a government-in-exile in the kingdom after the situation collapses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to better help everyone restore their country, we must not only accept the military power of various countries, but also accept refugees from various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military forces withdrawn from various countries will be handled by the headquarters. The other people who will be relocated need the government to take care of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to formulate corresponding plans now, especially because of the large number of refugees flooding into the kingdom due to the war, it is necessary to divert them in time to avoid affecting social security. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All proposals are for the benefit of the human race and for the countries of the Northern Continent. As for the deviation in everyone's understanding, it is not his problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to help the exiled governments restore their country in the future is a matter of the future. These complex issues need to be considered in order to win the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom loses the war, everyone present will either see the Lord of Dawn, or they themselves will be the government-in-exile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, to accept personnel from various countries will be a severe test for our finances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this war, we have cut expenses as much as possible, but the kingdom's finances are still not optimistic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for the large number of refugees, the kingdom is simply unable to provide relief. If you want to receive it, you can only distribute the tasks to the provinces and entrust everyone to help take care of them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado bit the bullet and suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, everyone is a shameless person, and they cannot directly come up to divide up the refugees, there must be a fig leaf.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This fig leaf happens to only be provided by the Treasury Department. The government has no money in its pocket, so it has no problem entrusting nobles from all over the country to take care of the refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hypocrisy is a bit hypocritical, but that's what everyone eats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing that made Hudson unhappy was that Marquis Delgado said this to him, not Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the proposal is approved, it means that the person who makes the decision is the marshal of the kingdom, not King Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a problem in the operation process in the future, the responsibility will also have to be borne by him, and it has nothing to do with Caesar IV.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"His Excellency's proposal is very realistic, that is, the provinces will share the pressure of the refugees according to the actual situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, you must do what you can. While accepting refugees, you must also fulfill the obligations entrusted by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the food pressure brought about by the increase in population, we must come up with stronger policies from now on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Open source work has been arranged. In addition to hurrying up to implement production, ocean fishing is currently the most potential mining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lords of the coastal areas have to work hard, the burden of the kingdom's food now falls on you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we need to talk about throttling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before this, the Kingdom also took some countermeasures, but that was far from enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time the crisis is more serious than before, so the measures we want to adopt must also be more radical than before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not enough to simply stop holding banquets and prohibit the use of grain to make wine. I propose that the kingdom formulate a set of temporary laws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Government Affairs will formulate a set of food rationing system according to the actual situation, and formulate corresponding ration standards according to different identities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, you still need to take the lead in implementing this matter! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson still has a bottom line after all, and he didn't do anything to blame his boss. Of course, Caesar IV has voluntarily helped him withstand the biggest thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the aftermath caused by the \"Scepter of Glory\", the division of refugees can only be regarded as pediatrics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he ate alone, and everyone shared the spoils together. If things get serious, the reputation will be affected at most, and it is impossible to really pursue responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the owner of the \"Scepter of Glory\" is the Holy See, but the owners of the refugees are a group of poor settlers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The former can make the kingdom deal with it carefully, but the latter can only yell a few times, and even a thick-skinned one can pretend not to hear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one cares about some political turmoil, and everyone's attention is attracted by the food rationing system proposed by Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar operations have precedents in the Alpha Kingdom, but the details are different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, organizations took the lead in saving food, but there was no law to regulate it, let alone specific food ration standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, it is the king and the nobles who take the lead in reducing expenses, for example: changing three meals to two meals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this is the case for external propaganda, how to implement it still depends entirely on self-consciousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, the food rationing system starts with me!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily ration standard is tentative: one pound of bread, one pound of meat, some ingredients, and some fruits and vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You all figure it out, set a standard for yourself, and give the people of the kingdom a good start, so that the work of the Ministry of Government Affairs will not be difficult. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said pretendingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Royal education from childhood is not for nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    King Caesar IV knew very well that after losing the right to speak in the military, he, the king, had to find an opportunity to show his presence if he wanted to hand over power smoothly after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take the lead in saving food. This kind of political project that is beneficial and cost-effective must not only be done, but must be done well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the king has set his standards so low, which makes it very difficult for everyone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this hierarchical world, a courtier cannot go beyond the king, and the standard has to continue to drop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV is in the deep palace compound, whether there are specific implementation standards, the outside world does not know.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But those who are often active outside often have to implement the standards, otherwise they lose the meaning of taking the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking the law is a small matter, the most important thing is not to implement the standards, and spreading the word will damage the reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, let's increase the quota a little more!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you use this standard, those of us in the rear are fine, but the ration standard for officers and soldiers on the front line cannot be obtained! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, stepped forward to persuade him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without considering the quality of food, the quota set by Caesar IV is really not much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under high-intensity training, two pounds of staple food is not useful at all. After all, the food that soldiers eat does not have such a high energy content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was treated like a king at every turn, and it seemed that everyone had no rules when it was passed on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This kind of standard is indeed a bit difficult for you. Forget it, let's add another pound of bread every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the military is special and cannot be carried out in accordance with conventional standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order that the staple food quota of officers and soldiers in the army shall not be lower than mine! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to what Caesar IV said, Hudson secretly regretted that he should not have communicated with the prime minister in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him is clearly collusion, deliberately creating a chance for Caesar IV to gain reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary soldiers don't have much discernment. The royal family only needs to publicize it, and Caesar IV's bad voice in the army will be completely washed away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that his coach brought too much pressure on Caesar IV. In order to stabilize the kingship, he was forced to put down his figure, take the initiative to lower his figure, and created an image of a monarch who \"loves soldiers like a son\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now doing this makes Hudson very passive. If you act out of line, it is easy to fall into the infamy of \"rebellious officials and thieves\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are also very obvious. Caesar IV pushed all the great nobles into a corner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what you think in your heart, you must follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the war is over, everyone will not have a good life. At least in front of outsiders, you have to suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With these people taking the lead, the food standard of lieutenant generals can also be lowered, and the treatment of ordinary soldiers can be raised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has made up his mind, and he will go to the army to carry out reforms to narrow the gap in food and treatment between officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have an opinion, let everyone argue with the king. Since Caesar IV wants to gain this reputation, he has to bear the abuse of vested interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that everyone was still unwilling to speak, Hudson stepped forward and said: \"Your Majesty leads by example, and we will naturally follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in terms of share, I don't think it is necessary to divide so many levels. After all, you have the strength to work when your stomach is full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In ordinary times, the big nobles will be subject to 90% of the ration standard of His Majesty; the middle nobles will be subject to 85% of the ration standard; and the minor nobles will be subject to 80% of the ration standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The civilians below are subject to a 30% discount on rations; serfs are subject to a 35% discount; slaves are subject to a 40% discount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grade of staple food, the subdivision of supplementary food, and the proportion of meat are still determined by the Ministry of Government Affairs according to everyone's identity and occupation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once everyone is recruited into the army, these standards will be invalidated and replaced by the standards in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking into account the actual situation, the food standards of officers and soldiers in the army must also be adjusted appropriately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His Majesty issued an order just now, setting the lower limit for officers and soldiers in the army, so now there is also a need to set an upper limit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What do you think is the appropriate position for this upper limit? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone has no opinion on the ration standard. The king's standard comes first, and no one can surpass it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing more than when there are few dishes on the table when you are doing activities outside, everyone will definitely not be hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food ration standard for serfs and civilians is not in the scope of everyone's consideration. The food rationing system is aimed at nobles and businessmen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The daily life of the people at the bottom has not reached the ration standard, so restrictions are out of the question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not a quota distribution, the so-called standard is actually an upper limit of food consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is the adjustment of food standards for officers and soldiers in the army, which has attracted everyone's attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From Hudson's proposal, everyone can see that he has premeditated for a long time. The delay in taking action is obviously out of fear of causing a backlash.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance of Caesar IV just now directly put everyone together and laid the foundation for the reform plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone, you look at me, I look at you, and for a while, I don't know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone agrees with the minimum lower limit proposed by Caesar IV just now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this is a time of war, and the king cannot starve his soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three pounds of staple food may seem like a lot, but this refers to cooked food, not three pounds of flour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of big stomach kings who have little oil and water in their stomachs and eat whole grains every day, it is impossible to support high-intensity training and fighting without eating a little more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is just asking everyone about the upper limit, and has not formulated specific standards, so he has no way to talk about it. It can't be said that there is no upper limit, can it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is saving money, there is no reason why there are still a bunch of people who continue to feast on fish and meat. Although these people are inextricably linked with everyone, it is not enough for everyone to fight desperately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this is also for the benefit of the kingdom, and does not touch the core interests of the major nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, the situation in the military is special, so the upper limit is reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to handle it flexibly according to the specific situation. In my opinion, set a reference standard and implement it according to the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key thing to do is the food standard level. Because of the war, it is best to cancel some hard-to-find ingredients. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero took advantage of the situation to make up the knife.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, limiting the total amount is just a feint, and the real goal is still to target food standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all military officers are big eaters. The real bulk of expenses is never in the quantity, but in the extravagant food standards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nothing in peaceful times, the nobles outside live like luxury. The number of noble officers in the army is limited, and the overall expenditure is limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war period is different. With the expansion of the army, the number of officers has expanded rapidly, and the required expenses have also become huge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Referring to the last war, we know that nearly 50% of the kingdom's military expenditure was spent on officers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining 50% of the military expenditure not only feeds a large number of soldiers, but also includes the expenditure on the weapons and equipment of the entire army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The food standard proposed now is just an entry point, and the real motivation is military reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Has nothing to do with Hudson's subjective wishes. With the existing resources, the Alpha Kingdom must carry out reforms if it wants to carry out this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Presenting the issue at this moment is essentially a showdown to the major forces, but the method is a bit obscure and does not directly touch everyone's sensitive nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the entry is opened, Hudson can take advantage of the opportunity to reach out to the logistics and reform and reorganize the current logistics system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inevitable to catch a few unlucky **** and kill Liwei.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accidentally involving the interests of a certain nobleman here is also a high probability event. Once reforms are launched, bloodshed is inevitable, mainly to see who will be unlucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson is not a pure reformer, and he does not have the gambler's nature to risk his own wealth and life for the sake of reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The purpose of the early showdown is to gain everyone's support and limit the bloodshed to the pawns below, so as not to cause a struggle among the upper echelons of the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no deep-seated change in the political structure, but only a compromise due to the situation. Such reforms are certainly not thorough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even once Hudson leaves office, vested interest groups can immediately counterattack, but this is also the easiest reform to succeed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty is right, the situation in the military is special, and we really need to be more flexible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Majesty, how do you think the upper limit is set at two to three times? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naked hints.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Relatively speaking, it is also the time when the resistance to reform is the least.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first measure is to check the accounts. Instead of checking the old accounts, we only look at the accounts of everyone in recent days and the implementation of the task of \"fat\" for the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Master Hudson had warned before that guys who can hit the muzzle of a gun are all ignorant masters, and they should be sacrificed for reform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But just because these people don't wink, doesn't mean the people behind them don't win either. Everyone knows very well that this reform is a decision jointly made by the bigwigs at the palace meeting, and no one is allowed to destroy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Smart people know how to do things. Hudson only went to arrest people, and he sent the \"stolen goods\" with a confession letter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cooperation efficiency was so high that it was faster than the raiding team, which made Hudson embarrassed to hold on to him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Self-defense eliminates the investigation link, saves a lot of social resources, and it is normal to be punished lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the massacre of nobles is likely to cause dissatisfaction among the ruling group. Naturally, Hudson will not deliberately make his own reforms more difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The face of all parties must be given, and the killing of chickens and monkeys must also be done. The principle of punishment becomes: capital crimes can be forgiven, living crimes cannot be forgiven.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the circumstances are minor and the crimes are meritorious, if the circumstances involved are serious, the titles will be expelled. The hereditary titles will be inherited by the descendants, and the honorary titles will be withdrawn directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In line with the principle of waste utilization, all those involved in the case will be included in the \"Warrior Battalion\". After the war starts, they will undertake the most dangerous tasks on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can complete three tasks, the previous old account will be written off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In view of the face of the forces behind these people, Hudson allowed everyone to bring guards to the battlefield. If he was willing to spend his money, he would not object to bringing private troops there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the glory of the nobility is lost, it will be washed away with blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a group of \"chickens\" who were killed, and realizing that Master Hudson is not easy to mess with, the follow-up work will be carried out much more smoothly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just half a month, the barracks changed drastically. The standard of food for the soldiers has increased, and the intensity of training has gradually increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson strictly followed the orders of Caesar IV, and he directly copied the staple food standards set by the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king had 2 pounds of fine bread a day, so the soldiers ate 70% rye vegetable bread; the king didn't know what kind of meat he ate, so the soldiers had to have a pound of meat a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fish, rabbit, chicken, goose, pork, beef, and mutton are all fine, anyway, the total amount must be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I dare not expect extravagant ingredients, what is the use, anyway, 1 pound of coarse salt per person per month must be guaranteed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fruits don't have to be extravagant, that's impossible. But vegetables must be no less than two pounds. Potatoes, soybeans and barley... These whole grains can also be vegetables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that there are a lot of quotas. In fact, Hudson has never seen leftovers in the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is the sequelae of lack of oil and water in the stomach. Only when the oil and water are replenished, everyone's food intake will gradually decrease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only one injured was the Royal Government, who was going crazy in order to raise a large amount of meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the soldiers were not picky eaters, they would eat the meat of any animal, and they would not be able to meet the demand for meat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, we can't go on like this. The depletion of the standing army alone will make us exhausted. What if we fully mobilize?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having been prime minister for so many years, he has never seen such an extravagant army. It would be nice for ordinary soldiers to be able to drink broth, but how about a pound of meat a day?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Prime Minister, you can rest assured that our military expenditure has not exceeded the standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I just ask you to use the original purchase of Warcraft meat, spices, and some luxury goods to purchase ordinary meat products.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I also cut some unnecessary expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: In the private kitchens of officers, it is stipulated that the servants they carry must be practitioners, it is forbidden to bring too many personal items, and some meaningless decorations are canceled...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After accurate calculations, the current military budget of the kingdom can fully meet the daily consumption of the standing army, and even buy some magic crossbows every month. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Saving money is impossible. Before the military expenditure reform, it was indeed in the name of saving military expenditure, but that was only to gain the support of the government.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the initial reforms have been completed, Hudson will naturally spend the money saved on improving combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite are all fed by money, and Hudson's series of victories in the Southern and Northern Wars is not only based on luck and planning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only when they were in the territory, but also improved the food standards of the soldiers. After entering the Principality of Moxi to fight, the soldiers opened their stomachs to eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nutrition can keep up with high-intensity training. Strict training and fighting on the battlefield finally cultivated an army with good combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this era, the material standard of the kingdom's standing army is actually not bad. But it can be better, why not improve it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, through rigorous training, improving physical strength and combat awareness, ordinary soldiers can also compete with low-level knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this set of \"heresy\" theories is currently Hudson's personal research and has not been disseminated to the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it has been done before, the samples are still too small. Among the more than 20,000 private troops in the family, there are only two to three hundred people who can compete with low-level knights through physical training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether these people have different talents or the theory is really effective, more samples are needed for verification.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson did everything in the standing army, not only to improve the combat effectiveness of the Kingdom's army, but also to verify his own theory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the fact that the expenditure has not exceeded the standard is also related to the current price system of the Alpha Kingdom. The normal market is affected by the relationship between supply and demand, and the price has already soared to the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But at present, the kingdom's means of production are all in the hands of the aristocratic group, and it is essentially a planned economy. The price agreed between the government and the noble lord will not change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you move to a wartime economy, it's even simpler. All strategic materials are collected directly and allocated by the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, I know that your reforms have achieved great results, but the supplies are not unlimited, and it is very difficult to supply the standing army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the kingdom is fully mobilized, it is simply impossible for us to provide so much meat, and the logistics will drag us down! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland tried to persuade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be honest, the daily consumption of the standing army is a terrifying figure in itself. If it is doubled again, the logistics will have to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by the upper limit of productivity, which can be reversed by non-manpower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, please rest assured that the national mobilization is a last resort. If our strategy is carried out normally, there is no need to mobilize so many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the analysis of the news from the prairie, the current orc empire is no longer the orc empire of the past. Their strength is less than half that of the peak period, and at most it is only 30-40% of the level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the materials are assembled on the front line in advance, and the training of the standing army is completed, we only need to gather another 250,000 noble elite private troops to fight them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of troops mobilized is reduced, and the consumption of materials is naturally reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such an increase and a decrease, you can do the math to see whether our logistics pressure has become smaller after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is that this time we are not simply defending, but to quickly defeat the Orc Empire, and then transfer the army to the Western Front. The requirements for soldiers are also greatly increased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a high-intensity use of troops, if the supply standard is not raised, I am afraid that the people will be used up before the war is over! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The perfect reason directly left the Grand Duke of Newfoundland speechless. His mind was full of \"strategic needs\", and even Hudson's prerequisites were ignored by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, if the fight is started at the door of the house, if the battle can be resolved quickly, it is indeed possible to meet the needs of the army by relying on the materials hoarded in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland was surprised to find that he was actually persuaded. Hudson's strategic plan is indeed very risky, but the Alpha Kingdom has no choice now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except that this plan is relatively reliable and has certain practicability, other people's strategic plans are even more illusory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: form an army of 300,000 monsters, directly fight the orc empire, and set foot on the elf kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that if the Alpha Kingdom wants to assemble 3,000 monster cavalry, they have to pull in underage monsters to make up the number, which is a hundred times away from the figure of 300,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: a drunken officer proposed to send a hundred sanctuary experts to directly destroy the leader of the opponent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Another example: A military officer who dozed off at work suggested that everyone pray together so that the Lord of Dawn will send divine punishment to destroy the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no unreliable, only more unreliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the officers are incompetent, it's that the kingdom's strength is too weak. Forcing everyone to ask for a plan, and they have to come up with different plans, so naturally they can only diverge their thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it can be realized is not important, the key is to hand over the task first. If it cannot be implemented, it is because the kingdom is not strong enough, not because there is a problem with the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, are you sure you can defeat the Orc Empire with such a small force?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Living in the shadow of the orcs all the time, it was hard for him to believe that he could defeat the orc empire only by gathering 500,000 troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Simply calculating military strength, such a small number of troops is naturally not enough, but wars are not simply based on military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to fight specifically, we still have to wait for the orcs to come over before we can determine the tactics. Don't worry, I know it well! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the plan is feasible or not, as the military commander of the kingdom, he must have confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't win, look for objective factors. Anyway, the Kingdom has fought the orcs so many times, and there was no time when they won by themselves alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Flander Kingdom, as the only country with a large port on the prairie, their development was smooth sailing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although tolls from various countries are not collected, the consumption brought by people coming and going will stimulate local consumption immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xinggang's development time is short, but in terms of prosperity, it is no less than the second-tier ports on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the importance attached to the port, the Farland Kingdom directly placed the capital in Xingang, which promoted the great development of the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the sudden war, Xingang would be able to develop into one of the most important ports in the continent of Aslant sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Does the Alpha Kingdom really dare to cut off the route?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Philip I asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the period of the Continental War. At the critical moment when the major forces unite together to deal with alien races, it is a taboo to stab an ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the past practice, even if it is to deceive people, it is a secret method, and no one dares to openly sabotage it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Alpha Kingdom has never said that it will cut off the route, but only sent someone to remind us that the sea has been rough recently and there are ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we don't accept their terms, maybe pirates will run rampant and rob our convoy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information provided by the merchant ship, the Alpha people have indeed formed a large-scale fleet to search for traces of ghost ships at sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, there are also many pirates who were originally active in the coast of the Alpha Kingdom. The trajectory of their activities continues to move northward, and the final destination is likely to be the sea off Xingang.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our fleet is too small to be a match for these pirates. The kingdom's sea route lifeline may be cut off at any time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Doni said with a face of embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Weak countries have no diplomacy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the Alpha Kingdom, the Farland Kingdom is a weak chicken, and in terms of overall strength, it is only a large province of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is the support of the most powerful country in the mainland, it will not be able to quench the near thirst. If they fell out directly, before the Frankish Kingdom could spare their hands, they would be destroyed by the orcs first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accepting Alpha Kingdom's proposal means that their strategy to preserve their strength has failed. Even if the main force is withdrawn, it is inevitable to continue to fight the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we must carefully consider the Alpha people's proposal. The continental war has reached a stalemate, and the stimulated orcs have increased their offensive strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the flames of war will reach Xingang in the second half of the year, and our evacuation plan must be started as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If possible, we'd better negotiate a solution to the current crisis. Perhaps you can consider asking the Frankish Kingdom to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is too hasty, and we have no way to withdraw all the citizens. It is also a good choice to throw those who were about to give up to the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs can try their appetite, and it is worth paying some price in exchange for our evacuation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, if the future kingdom wants to be restored, it is necessary to win their support. This protection fee will be handed over sooner or later! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gottel gritted his teeth and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the minister of military affairs, he chose to compromise, which was definitely not his original intention, but the orcs didn't give face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the two parties communicate secretly and they agree to give up most of the country, the Orc Empire is not willing to let them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the strategy of slowing down the army fails, then the only option is to face the orcs head-on. In order for the allies to last a few more days, they could only send troops to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Alpha Kingdom intends to detain them as cannon fodder, in fact similar operations have already happened on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega, which were the first to perish, were forcibly requisitioned when they passed by neighboring countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, it is temporarily borrowed for use, but in fact, everyone knows that this is a trick of borrowing without repaying.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for sure that they couldn't keep it, I'm afraid the refugees from the two countries would also be divided up by everyone, and they wouldn't even leave a hair for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He slapped the table fiercely, and Philip I, who was furious, immediately cursed: \"Damn Alpha people, they are just a bunch of robbers!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have written down this grudge!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And let them wait, our future will be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while of venting, Philip I calmed down, looked into the distance and said: \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent people to communicate with the Alpha Kingdom, and we can make some concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell the Alpha people that as long as they are willing to ensure the safety of the route, refugees from the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega can be given to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees from other countries behind, as long as they enter the kingdom, we can also send them to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, they need to send their own boats to pick them up, or arrange for the refugees to leave by land. We don't have extra transportation capacity for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha people are determined to stay with us and negotiations cannot solve the problem, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must also stabilize them and buy time for the family members of the kingdom's nobles to evacuate. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes are constantly being staged in the five grassland countries. It's just that everyone is facing a different situation. Even if they want to evacuate from the sea, they must borrow a way from the Farland Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing the lessons of the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega, everyone is now wary of allies. I am very worried that I will be backstabbed by my allies during the evacuation process.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actions of the Alpha Kingdom made them even more chilled. It's fine to give up some serfs. After all, the orc army came too fast, and they didn't have the ability to evacuate all the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is unbearable to keep the noble master as cannon fodder. There is nothing to say, this kind of thing must be reported to the parents!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The negative teaching material is in front of us, we must make a big deal and force the Alpha Kingdom to compromise, otherwise the future will be worrisome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the departure of letters asking for help, the situation in the mainland was once again stirred up. The prairie, which had been out of everyone's sight for many days, once again gathered eyes from all over the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The Kingdom's standing army is as high as 270,000 people, and it is unrealistic for them all to gather together for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only a few legions guarding the capital under the city, and the other troops are receiving military training in their respective stations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the actual situation of the garrison, some troops run circles around the barracks, and some troops go directly to the field for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the supply of supplies guaranteed, Hudson was relentless and strictly ordered the noble officers to take the troops for physical training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to be lazy, as long as you don't get caught, Marshal Hudson is patrolling the sky on a giant dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once caught, they will be downgraded and dealt with at least, or thrown into the \"warrior camp\" to commit crimes and meritorious deeds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The competition within the nobles is also very fierce. The children of the nobles who are in the standing army are basically masters without fief inheritance, and they are still waiting to make contributions on the battlefield?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Demotion treatment, not only reduces the official position, but also the success rate of their achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, the more senior the general, the more secure he is, and the easier it is to accumulate military merit. Many times, relying on the efforts of his subordinates, he can start with a lot of military merit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, the middle and lower ranks of officers are much harder. As the specific implementers of strategies and tactics, they often undertake the most dangerous tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In all previous wars, the casualty rate of the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom remained high. The main reason was that the middle and lower class nobles often led their soldiers to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Throw it into the \"Warrior Camp\", let alone. Performing the hard task of narrowly dying, the credit for completing the task must first be used to make up for the mistakes made before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that from the moment you step into the warrior camp, you have already bid farewell to \"success and fame\". Some are just a hard-pressed atoner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone suppressed the disappointment in their hearts. Deciding to follow Hudson to steal a lesson will certainly not lack patience.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you don't understand, just record it first. Go back and copy it back intact, just copy it directly to see the effect.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that someone was stealing, Hudson didn't interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are so many officers and soldiers participating in the training, someone will always record it, and it is doomed not to keep it secret from the moment the training starts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is plagiarism intact, the effect cannot be replicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers in front of me are all from the battlefield. Although most of them are from the logistics force, they have seen blood on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not as good as the previous standing army. That is because the original standing army of the kingdom is stationed on the border all year round, and has frictions with the orcs every now and then, and occasionally goes deep into the orc empire to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in peaceful times, thousands of people are lost in combat every year. If his own ability is not good, he would have been eliminated long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the case of sufficient supplies, veterans undergo rigorous training and have a high probability of being transformed into elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult for ordinary serf soldiers to achieve this effect without going to the battlefield to see blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For half a month, there was nothing new about physical training and queue training. Occasionally, combat training was simply a few moves of hacking, slashing and stabbing, which stunned the big nobles who stole their masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Torsten, our Marshal Hudson's training is the same every day. What's so interesting?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this familiar voice, he turned his head and glanced at the person coming, Duke Thorsten said angrily: \"Hero, stop doing this!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing interesting to say, the details of the training process are the most detailed records you have recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I'm not mistaken, you have already sent someone back to try these training contents in the family's private army. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Social beatings are the best way to make people grow. The hard times in recent years have made these Northland Dukes who came to power ahead of schedule grow a lot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you stand on the opposite side, those who should steal the teacher still have to steal the teacher, and the face is only worth a few dollars in the face of survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"hey-hey…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Torsten said this, as if you didn't learn it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hudson's training method is simple, but it is effective!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    伱Looking at the teams outside the city, they are obviously different from before. It seems that he has taken over this army for less than two months, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the military training methods passed down by our families are actually not that complicated, and even the latter part of the content overlaps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that our serf soldiers usually train every five days and every ten days. Only a small number of elites can train every three days. Here, they train every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson is also ruthless enough to directly cut down the welfare benefits of noble officers to improve the food standards of these big soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for his nutrition to keep up with such crazy tossing, people would have been disabled by him long ago. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero made complaints unabashedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can see the problem. Even if I can't see it, the family think tanks behind me will help analyze it, but it doesn't mean that I can follow suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the kingdom's standing army, it is actually more difficult for the noble private army to carry out system reforms.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A standing army belongs to the kingdom, not to someone else. In order to win the war, it is acceptable for nobles to temporarily lose part of their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family private army is different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because they are all on their own, they can safely hand over their backs to their companions when fighting, and they can often exert stronger combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It also originated from our own people. If we want to carry out system reform, the resistance we face is also from top to bottom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the head of the family is strong enough, the improvement of the treatment of the soldiers can barely be implemented, but if he wants to reduce the treatment of the noble officers, then there is no need to discuss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is a hero of the family, so why should the salary be reduced? The head of the family has to be reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, as long as there is no corruption within the family and everyone is allowed to sacrifice temporarily at a critical moment, then it is not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, like Hudson's reforms, these are temporary emergency measures, and once the danger is lifted, they will soon return to their original state.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, you two, there is no need to discuss Marshal Hudson's military capabilities. If you have this spare time, why not think about how to deal with the next situation!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez said helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that they hold great power at a young age and are the envy of everyone outside, but in fact they have a hard time knowing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest shortcoming of taking the position early is the lack of prestige, and it is impossible to suppress the old guys in the clan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is the head of the family in name, but unfortunately because of the wrong decision made by the previous head of the family, the family has suffered heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the kingdom's strict succession system, there might be a drama of side branches seizing the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The power of the Patriarch was affected, no matter whether it was internally or externally, none of them could become strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes a decision is made, but it will be overturned in the clan, and there are more cases of obedience and violation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the five Northland families were at their peak, they would have jumped out to compete for the position of coach. It is definitely not that simple for Hudson to want to be in the top position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now let alone fight for the position of coach, they don't even have the confidence to fight for the position of deputy coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they were nominated, they could only reluctantly refuse. There is no other reason, it is that none of them believe that they can do well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rodriguez, do you think it will be our turn to control the next situation?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is doomed to follow the general trend, so why bother yourself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the kingdom can survive this calamity smoothly, there is nothing wrong with us being the dogs of the house. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just his actual practice, which obviously doesn't match what he said. If he was really going to follow the crowd, he wouldn't be so active in stealing lessons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is obvious that the conversation between the few people was deliberately told to someone who cares. If you really want to discuss matters, you can't choose this heavily guarded city gate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Caesar IV succeeded to the throne, they have intentionally or unintentionally moved closer to the king in order to get rid of their embarrassing political position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, the plan is half successful. Under the operation of Caesar IV, their relationship with the royal family has eased slightly, but their political isolation has not been able to change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, they were still too impatient. They urgently needed to change their political status, and they couldn't hide it from the old foxes in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I offended so many people before, and now I want to turn around in decline, how can everyone let them relax?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the goodwill released by the royal family to them, it is all illusory. Caesar IV said that he would accept them, but no one knew what he thought in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, their ancestors ruined the royal family and lost their ancestral property, and the older generation who have personally experienced it have not died yet!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With these old antiques, the matter is not over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Coupled with Hudson's strong rise, they lost the right to speak in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to avoid being hit in the war, the few of them had to repeatedly express that they had no ambitions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Lutetia, the eighteenth council of the Terran Alliance kicked off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has been less than two years since the last meeting closed, making it look like a permanent institution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way. There are too many things that need to be coordinated by all parties in the outbreak of the continental war, and there must be a meeting to discuss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The delay in the opening was mainly due to the fact that the last meeting had just ended, and it seemed very cheap to hold another meeting immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    National countries do not want to start this \"historical name\". When encountering problems, representatives of all parties discuss and deal with them in private, until representatives of the five grassland countries jointly initiate a proposal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem was brought to the alliance meeting, which was obviously the result of the breakdown of the negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What is surprising is that Charles III, who loves the limelight, is \"at home sick\" at the moment, and instead of coming to join in the fun, he let the prime minister, Duke Bergson, preside over the meeting as the representative of the host.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Predrag, what is your country's opinion on the joint complaint of the Kingdom of Farland, the Kingdom of Ita, the Kingdom of Light, the Duchy of Gamma, and the Duchy of Delta?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Bergson asked seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Welcoming everyone's gaze, Earl Predrag smiled and said: \"Your Excellency, Members of Parliament, these accusations are pure nonsense!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When did we cut off the air route and affect the war between the grassland countries and the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for threatening countries to withdraw their troops to our country and using them as cannon fodder, it is even more blatant slander!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a shameless thing can only be done by a rogue country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know how some people's brains are so long. We only reminded us of the strong wind and waves at sea once, but we made up so many pictures in our brains.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid it's an excuse deliberately fabricated by some people who are greedy for life and afraid of death, and want to be deserters in front of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyone with a little common sense knows that if the countries on the grassland fall, there are only two evacuation routes for the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few boats on the sea are not enough for some selfish deserters, so where are the boat tickets for ordinary civilians?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our country's willingness to accept refugees is due to the noble spirit of responsibility and compassion for the weak...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These slanders appear mainly because we are unwilling to accept cowards who flee without fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These scum who enjoyed the glory of the nobles and were unwilling to take responsibility, fabricated these accusations in order to avenge the kingdom! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics, thick-skinned, eat enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how much the five grassland countries accuse, they are all things that haven't happened yet. As long as the Alpha Kingdom bites dead and refuses to admit it, it is impossible to convict the crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the original proposal was issued, the Five Nations did not expect to do anything to the Alpha Kingdom. They just wanted to create pressure from public opinion and force the Alpha people to give up their plan to use them as cannon fodder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that a storm of public opinion has been created, but the direction of the wind is not right. The Alpha Kingdom, which should have been blamed for being busy explaining, directly bit them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Deserter\", a seemingly simple word, was a heinous crime during the Continental War.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once they fall, even if they evacuate from the grassland intact, there will be no place for them on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The relatives, friends, and family members of the past will be ashamed of them, and even the family behind them will be ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Predrag, you are completely slandering!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's all slander!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We are busy fighting **** the front line, and you are watching the excitement in the rear, deliberately sitting and watching...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the representatives of the five countries continue to file complaints, the smile on Earl Predrag's face became brighter and brighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other party panicked so quickly, there is only one explanation: they are really planning to run away!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that it has been dismantled, it will undoubtedly seriously affect the evacuation plan of the five countries. If the movement range is a little bigger, it will cause an uproar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The window paper was pierced, even if there was a chance to withdraw the main force, they dare not implement it now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people were to be evacuated from the sea, the spittle stars within the human race alone would be able to drown them, let alone restore the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Whether there is any slander, everyone knows in their hearts that many congressmen present here are not blind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, there are so many of you returning home to visit your relatives!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is a time of war, and all resources should be tilted towards war. Tens of thousands of people return home every month to visit their relatives. It seems that your war potential is quite large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Talking about using allies as cannon fodder, I think the representatives of the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega will have something to say.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the tens of thousands of troops that broke out from the two countries are now less than five hundred, and they are short of sending their king to the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are also afraid of being tricked when we meet your low morals and allies who want to be deserters!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone can rest assured that the kingdom will take over when needed, who made us and the orcs enemies! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly defending, but it sounds like everyone still thinks it makes sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is an indisputable fact that the number of people visiting relatives in grassland countries has skyrocketed. According to the rules, transferring family members in advance is also crossing the line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that for this kind of thing, everyone usually turns a blind eye to it, and no one wants to do it right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All members of the House of Representatives here know about cheating teammates. When the incident happened, the two victims of the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega also approached everyone to uphold justice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the reasons for the Five Kingdoms of the Grassland are very good, all in order to resist the invasion of orcs. In addition, it was only forcibly expropriated at that time, and it had not been used as cannon fodder, and everyone could not be convicted in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the incident, both the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega were left blank, and even the investors behind them chose to admit their losses, so naturally no one would stand up for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is determined that there is no way to recover, and the representatives of the two countries in the parliament are too lazy to do useless work and start their retirement career in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Earl Predrag's words pushed them to the foreground again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Earl is right, our two countries just mistrusted five shameless allies, and even lost the last seed of the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even our king is under house arrest. And use this as a threat to prevent us from appealing to the Alliance Council!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to His Majesty's safety, we can only choose to compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today finally let us wait for the opportunity to speak, in front of many congress representatives, I don't believe you dare to kill the king! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dog thief, today we want to seek justice for the dead souls of the Principality!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The accusations of the Earl of Carliss and the Earl of Houston instantly brought the atmosphere of the venue to a climax.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Cut off the route\", \"Sit back and watch the allies defeat\", \"Desert soldiers\", \"Use allies as cannon fodder\", each topic is already sensitive enough, and now a \"house arrest monarchy case\" has been involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If any accident happened to Borent I and Baird I, there would be a regicide case immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The incident became more and more troublesome, and the congressmen who had been watching the excitement gradually couldn't sit still.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous issues are easy to talk about. After the sexual war is settled, the responsibility of the country concerned can be slowly investigated, but the regicide case must not happen under their noses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is only a possibility, it is not allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere in the silent venue was terribly oppressive. The representatives of the five grassland countries who were forced to the corner hurriedly came out to explain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they were interrupted by Duke Bergson as soon as they spoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I don't care what kind of grievances there are among the seven grassland countries, such things as house arrest of the monarchs of other countries are not allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trying to kill the king in vain is a heinous crime!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I propose that the alliance send a fleet to bring back Borent I and Baird I. During this period, you must ensure the safety of the two majesties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the issues, after the two Majesties arrive in Lutetia, we will hold a meeting to discuss. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that Duke Bergson is suppressing the five steppe countries, but he is actually saving the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the discussion continues, not to mention forcing the Alpha Kingdom to give up its plan, maybe the Five Grassland Kingdoms will become suspects of regicide first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Five Prairie Kingdoms are still politically immature after all, and it would be a big failure to bring something that hasn't happened to the Alliance Parliament.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But his own **** is not clean, and he left people with a handle on the issue of the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega. How could the Alpha Kingdom give up this opportunity?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alliance meeting had just begun, and the five grassland countries were directly defeated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, none of the crimes they sued the Alpha Kingdom had had time to happen. On the contrary, they themselves were charged with the same crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for Duke Bergson's timely rescue, it is estimated that within a few days, the Alliance Council will be able to receive the news of the assassination of Borent I and Baird I.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the five grassland countries will become coal, and even jumping into the sea will not be able to clear up the suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of multiple crimes, any actions taken by the Alpha Kingdom against them will become legal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even now, their identities have changed from plaintiffs to defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, their problem is not how to accuse the Alpha Kingdom of crimes, but how to make the Alpha Kingdom let go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Obviously reminded them before, not to make things big, but they just didn't listen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it's all right, everything is as he expected, and things have gotten out of hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The day's affairs came to an end for the time being. It was the face of the Alpha people for the Frankish Kingdom, so they didn't continue to delve into it, but it didn't mean the matter was over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, if everyone communicates well, the major incident can be reduced to a minor one; if the conditions cannot be negotiated, the final decision of the Human Race Alliance will be very unfavorable to the Farland Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how big the trouble is, he has to help solve it. Who made King Flandre his younger brother! As the eldest brother, he has the obligation to clean up the mess for the younger brother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell Philip, don't always be smart. I will take care of the aftermath for you today, but this is the last time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what happens next, Baird I and Borent I must not have any accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And your idiot evacuation plan, stop it now. Is it true that all representatives of the House of Representatives in the Terran Alliance are dead?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay when no one is watching. You several countries act together, and you may be able to cover things up with the help of your connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now because you idiots messed around and offended the Alpha people to death, they are waiting for you to make mistakes!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Using allied troops as cannon fodder, putting the monarchs of neighboring countries under house arrest, and another crime of desertion, do you want to send yourself to the gallows with your own hands, just to feel comfortable? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had secretly regretted it. If he had known that things were so troublesome, he would not have spent a lot of money to push his younger brother to the throne.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits of this investment have not yet been seen, but the troubles have not stopped. From the initial kingdom building to the current situation, the family has paid too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you stop the loss now, you will lose everything. If you don't move, at least there is hope of recovering the cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is not only the royal family that invests in the Kingdom of Farland, but also a group of dignitaries in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I just wanted to find a good job for my children, but I didn't expect the situation to develop too fast, and the mainland war broke out before it could gain a firm foothold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Additional investment is definitely not as important as one's own main business. The Kingdom of Frankish wants to give priority to the domestic battlefield, and the support it can provide to the Kingdom of Frankland is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please calm down! What happened this time was completely accidental, and there will never be a next time!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the Alpha people are too despicable, they don't admit to what they have done, and they bite us back!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially Carliss and Houston, the two idiots, who had promised to stand with us in advance, but they turned their backs on the spot and caught us off guard...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay if you don't explain it. Hearing what Earl Davis said, the anger in Charles III's heart rose again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a cold drink, he walked away directly. Deep down in his heart, he understood very well that these people's political inexperience was not due to their own abilities, but more because of their family positioning!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Frankish Kingdom is different from the Alpha Kingdom. The death rate of noble children is not that high. In order to prevent troubles during the power transition, they often focus on cultivating heirs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other children can also share family resources, but the education they receive is not exactly the same. Many people have been trained in the direction of professional talents since birth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In their respective fields, these people are talents. The ability to comprehensively consider problems will inevitably be lacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Located in the core area of ​​the human race, there are not many opportunities in the Frankish Kingdom. Even if you can go out to start a business, it is not a problem to be qualified as a small and medium-sized noble lord through temporary make-up courses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the plan did not change quickly. Decades ago, no one knew that there would be a chance to establish the Farland Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of people who were supposed to be ordinary nobles in the kingdom were pushed to the fore by the torrent of the times to take charge of the destiny of a country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly in a high position, it cannot be made up for by making up lessons. If the world is peaceful, with the support of the Frankish Kingdom, they can also slowly learn experience at work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the troubled times came too early, and before they were ready, they ushered in the first international game, and were taught a lesson severely by the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III was unwilling to talk nonsense, because he knew very well that if he wanted to mature quickly in politics, he could only make people step on the pits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, right now, if the dignitaries of the Kingdom of Flandre cannot put away their desire to prove their abilities, they will not be able to mature politically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is doomed to pay tuition fees, and it is cheaper to pay the fees earlier. What the Alpha Kingdom wants is cannon fodder, and they don't want the lives of these nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By using allies as cannon fodder as brutally as the Five Prairie Kingdoms, the Alpha people's next operations must have a lot of technical content, at least they will not leave any grounds for attack on the surface.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar troubles were encountered by Pius VII. It's just that because of the distance, he received the news a little later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was no prior warning about the nonsense of not listening to persuasion, but there was no rush to output anger. He was also angry, and he was even more angry that the Alpha people didn't show face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the anger was not too great this time. After all, it is not a matter of a day or two for the Alpha Kingdom not to buy into the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Is there any news about Josip and Jelacic?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having not received any news for a long time, deep down in his heart he already had an ominous premonition. Even if the team sent out is very strong, the strength of these people will still be greatly reduced when they reach the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the enemy doesn't give them a chance to fight in close combat, most of the knights will have nothing to show their strength and can only be reduced to spectators in naval battles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The place where the fleet disappeared is close to the Alpha Kingdom. Others dare not do black hands to the people of the Holy See, but it is hard to say when they meet those alpha lunatics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we are working hard to investigate. Judging from the current situation, the team looking for the artifact may be in danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the collected information, before the pirate fleet disappeared, it sank a warship of the Dalton family on the southeast coast of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, the main fleet of the Dalton family assembled, and even the dragon knight Hudson also appeared in the fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to compete for the dominance of the southeastern province, the Koslow family and the Dalton family had many conflicts secretly. Under normal circumstances, Hudson should not appear in the enemy's fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To get them to join forces, I am afraid that there is only a higher level of pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very likely that Josip, Jerachich and his party exposed their identities, attracted the attention of the Alpha Kingdom, and planned this operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not ruled out that the appearance of the artifact attracted the prying eyes of the Dalton family and the Koslow family, and the two jointly planned the attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The possibility of the latter is relatively small. The Koslow family is a master in Hudson, and the master of the Dalton family was also severely damaged in the last war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have compared the strength of the two fleets. Although the fleet of the Dalton family has the upper hand, it does not have the ability to wipe out the Barbarian Pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the vast sea, as long as you want to leave, most of the warships should be able to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are the only ones who take action, even if our people will lose, the whole army will not be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the Alphas sent more masters to join the battle. Just after the naval battle, a large number of strong men appeared on our ship, preventing the fleet from retreating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the Dragon Knights, it is not difficult for them to send the master to the pirate ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If our people have found the artifact, it is very likely that the artifact has now fallen into the hands of the Alphas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Combined with their dragnet search in the misty sea area, it is likely to be the last round of hunting and extermination of survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least from all the information we have collected, no one has ever seen a ghost ship except for the fleet of the Dalton family! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisey analyzed with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The truth or something, it all depends on the brain. In the business of collecting intelligence, it is impossible to do without an imaginative brain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    My family members are missing, and there must be an explanation. In the absence of evidence, letting hostile forces take the blame is the best option.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Ulisse had a premonition that this matter was done by the Alpha people, and the Hudson and Dalton families were the specific executors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the Holy See needs to help the Kingdom of Light to tide over the difficulties. However, a series of evidences that have appeared in the Alliance Parliament are very detrimental to the Kingdom of Light. The Holy See cannot directly come out to help them stand in order to avoid suspicion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Received by the Pope, Ulise, who was politically savvy, simply pinned the blame for the disappearance of the treasure hunting team on the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, look for the bad luck of the Alpha Kingdom, which is the personal grievances between the two families. Helping the Kingdom of Light to relieve stress was completely accidental and coincidental.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Damn Alpha people, they have repeatedly provoked the majesty of my Holy See, this time they must be taught a lesson!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to use the pretext of encircling and suppressing pirates to let our fleet move northward to put pressure on the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they don't know how to advance or retreat, and still want to block the route, then let our fleet continue to go north to help them encircle and suppress the ghost ship. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Canglan City, Marshal Hudson, who was supposed to ride a giant dragon to inspect the training of the army, was chatting with a group of nobles on the tower at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A dragon roar pierced through the air, and Maxim started his day's inspection work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the huge body of the dragon, it is really not so easy to find out whether there is a dragon knight on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally touch the fish, the people below will not notice. After all, a giant dragon is not a hardworking creature, and it is really embarrassing for the dragon to work alone without the dragon knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson took the dragon out every day, blinding the eyes of many nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You must know that the other three dragon knights on the mainland are either sleeping or doing mischief. When the dragon knight was not paying attention, the dragon went out to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the circumstances that the same kind are not at ease, Maxim, who seems to be a quiet and diligent dragon, has become an outlier among dragons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the kingdom, Maxim has his own title—the most moral dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for him reaching out to the kingdom for a salary, everyone expressed their understanding. For creatures with overwhelming combat power like giant dragons, everyone's requirements are generally not high, as long as they don't cause trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is better to buy peace with money than to be robbed by a giant dragon. This guy never cares about the severity of his strikes. If he is killed or disabled, it would be a tragedy in life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, how long will the soldiers' physical training last?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran asked casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's practice for another two or three months. When they can travel hundreds of miles a day with light clothes, they can barely start the next stage of training.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is not bragging. In the extraordinary world, even if you have never practiced, nourished by energy elements, the physical potential of human beings is far stronger than that in the technological world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elites who have undergone rigorous training are all special forces in the technological plane. Traveling hundreds of miles a day is completely achievable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elites in their own territory can guarantee a certain combat effectiveness even if they travel hundreds of miles a day, regardless of logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this kind of high-intensity march cannot become the norm. It's okay to come here for two days occasionally, if it's like this every day, unless he can train all the soldiers into knights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just think about it, Hudson is satisfied if one or two percent of the soldiers can pass acquired physical training and reach the level of a first-order knight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this is still in the groping stage. If you want to increase this ratio, the best way is to create a supporting practice method to actively absorb the energy between heaven and earth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has studied various cultivation systems on the continent of Aslante, but he is still far from creating a universal practice that does not require qualifications.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats have arrogance to commoners. In addition to status, cultivation talent is also an important reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson conducted a test in the territory, and the proportion of civilian children with cultivation talent is much lower than that of the noble group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the god-given blood circulating in the outside world, Hudson is more willing to believe that it is genetic optimization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marriage within the aristocratic group, both parents have cultivation talents, and the children themselves are a combination of excellent genes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who have the cultivation talent focus on training, those without the cultivation talent are directly eliminated, and the survival of the fittest is selected from generation to generation, and the talents of the younger generations are naturally upward as a whole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Two or three months is not very long. The only problem is that your military training method consumes too much material. We can persist in a short period of time. After a long time, everyone can't bear it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Earl Oran's complaint, Hudson smiled slightly. He has heard similar complaints countless times, but everyone's bodies are still very honest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the kingdom's backing and the guarantee of supplies, Hudson would not dare to train soldiers like this. Including training his own private army in the past, the intensity was not so high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget about other supplies, meat alone consumes more than 200 tons every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the meat supply provided by the Kingdom, we can see that the proportion of fish meat is getting higher and higher. Obviously, the production of other meats cannot keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to meet the needs of the army, the kingdom has issued decrees requiring local lords to organize manpower to expand pig and poultry farming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, even if the kingdom does not ask for it, due to the increase in the army's meat demand, the nobles in various places will develop their own breeding industry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The upper and lower aristocrats took effect, and the big aristocrats started it up, worrying that the small and medium aristocrats below would not follow suit. Even if they don't know what it is for, their instinct will still make them choose to follow up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that Hudson alone has driven the unprecedented development of the kingdom's breeding industry. The only question is whether this enthusiasm can last forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, Hudson is not optimistic about developing the breeding industry at this time. It has nothing to do with farming technology, but mainly with food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, the kingdom had no surplus food to feed the livestock. Even if there is food in the warehouse, the nobles are reluctant to do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, with the current price system, the price of beef and mutton is five times that of rye, and the price of pork is only three times more. Raising pigs with grain is a blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that everyone is reluctant to use food and it will not affect the kingdom's war readiness, Hudson didn't bother to bother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slower the growth cycle, the slower the growth cycle. Maybe in the middle and late stages of the war, they can still catch up with the slaughter of these animals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worst thing is that these animals can be raised, and it can also slightly improve the food of the people at the bottom. Noble gentlemen are reluctant to throw pork.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everything to win the war!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hard times are only temporary. When the mainland war is over and the military pressure is not as great as it is now, our consumption will drop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you're lucky, you might even get some windfalls. We can't afford to offend the elves, and the ghostly place where the ancient survivors stay is not worth plotting, but the orc prairie kingdom still has a chance to get a share.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Seven Kingdoms of the Prairie were destroyed by the orcs, and it is still unknown whether they can be restored. Anyway, now that we have fallen out with our neighbors, it doesn't matter if we offend a little bit more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Move the boundary line out, and the family will be divided into a county, which will be regarded as our military compensation, and it should not lose too much in general. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson once again drew the cake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strongest measure to improve the combat effectiveness of the army is training?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Hudson's view, that is just the basic factor for normal performance. If you want everyone to perform at a super level, you still have to rely on painting cakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a very technical test. Ordinary soldiers are easy to fool, and their appetites are not very big. Throwing some noble titles out is enough to make them desperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the great nobles in the kingdom are different. This group of people has good vision and brains, and Hudson dare not treat them as fools.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is painting cakes, it is necessary to draw cakes that everyone can smell. People can see through the pure fake big space at a glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So the elves and the ancient survivors must be ruled out, and only the prairie can make a plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it is the land of allies, but now that everyone has fallen out, there is no need to be so polite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One family and one county, everyone has the strength to eat it, and at the same time, they can tie the interests of the kingdom's major forces to the border.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the neighbors are weak, this is the frontier base for external expansion; when the neighbors are strong, everyone can cooperate sincerely to face the threat of foreign enemies, which is a good choice for all parties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, are you so optimistic about this war?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Carles asked in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is thinking about how to get through the crisis. Many people have made plans to go home after defeat and stick to the castle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Carles, risks and opportunities always coexist. As long as we fight fast enough on the battlefield, we can win this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire has fallen, and the Seven Prairie Kingdoms are nominally seven countries, but the military strength of a single family may not be able to catch up with you.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such opponents, even the orcs were not able to destroy them in one fell swoop. Isn't that the problem?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After defeating the Orc Empire, we are blitzing the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, and we have negotiated for the remaining elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, we don't border with them. There was no hatred in the past, and the two sides have a basis for compromise. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuously fooling all parties, a lot of words have been said many times, and Hudson himself is about to believe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Orc Empire's slow progress on the battlefield is not only due to military strength, but also due to logistical pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How rich are the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, I am afraid that the mice will cry when they go, and the spoils of war are pitifully small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to fortify the walls and clear the fields, they themselves are \"clear\". For some orc races that eat grass, it is not a big problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local nobles and lords are not determined to fight to the death, so naturally they will not force the people to give the orcs extra meals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was not much population in the first place, and once they spread out in the vast prairie, even fewer \"vegetable people\" were captured by the orc army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lessons of the last war still gave the Orc Empire a memory. Considering the issue of internal unity, the five royal families also had to restrain themselves a bit, not daring to openly use the cannon fodder race as military rations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to worrying about the loss of troops, they did not work as hard as before when attacking the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when he realized that the defenders were just trying to delay the time and give an explanation to the ethnic alliance, he was even less interested in attacking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the superimposition of multiple factors, the attack speed of the orc army seemed very weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of the truth, if it comes to Hudson, the coach of the kingdom, it must be a sign of the decline of the orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adhering to the principle of fooling each other, Hudson did not hesitate to brainwash everyone over and over again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The following strategies are all based on the premise of a quick victory against the orcs and a big victory. In case something happens on the battlefield, it will be as if Master Hudson didn't say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, there are still very few great nobles who believe in this judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that these guys in high positions not only have good brains, but also have a bunch of think tanks behind them to help analyze, it is really not easy to fool around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing that it was a scam, but still running to the party, in essence, I still have no idea and want to seek psychological comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these doubts were limited to the gathering of the great nobles, and everyone outside showed full confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Every time they go back, everyone will carry out the artistic processing of Ha's fudge Dafa and pass it on to their subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a word, they, the high-level kingdoms, can be suspicious, but the middle and lower nobles and low-level soldiers below must firmly believe that the kingdom can win the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you encounter setbacks on the battlefield in the future, it will be after everyone's joint efforts—the kingdom wins the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any questions or problems must be concluded with \"the kingdom can win the war\" for argumentation and analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (Remarks: King Boshirent I of the Duchy of Shillong, a typo in the previous chapter has been revised)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In recent days, the Franks have been mediating the conflict between the Alpha Kingdom and the Five Grassland Nations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As one of the powerful factions in the kingdom, if the other party doesn't come to him, there will be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the current diplomatic situation, the kingdom seems to have an advantage, but in fact it can't really compare with the five grassland countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom needs the five grassland countries as cannon fodder to buy time for its own war preparations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that in the Alliance Council, they were charged with a lot of crimes, but it was precisely because the charges were too great that they could not be dropped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the charges are confirmed, the dignitaries of the five grassland countries will not be able to get along with the human race. Why should they fight hard?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, the current battle on the prairie is a group of dignitaries working hard for their own reputation and the hope of restoring the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom is now biting their handle, mainly to exert pressure so that the dignitaries on the grassland dare not run away easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It would be even more perfect if they could receive their inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the overall situation is important!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing a burst of output from Minister Frank, Hudson just drank his tea calmly, and after a long while, he said slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, it is for the sake of the overall situation that we cannot give up easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current actions of the five grassland countries have set a bad start for our human race. If we don't punish them severely, what if everyone follows suit in the future? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Playing stupid, he is a professional. The five grassland countries are indeed very important to the Alpha Kingdom now, but the conditions still need to be discussed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farce caused by the Five Grasslands in the Human Race Alliance Parliament, the Alpha Kingdom did not suffer on the surface, but in essence its international reputation was greatly affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no evidence, but it does not mean that something does not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the farce, the perceptions of the Alpha Kingdom from all countries in the Northern Continent have changed. The original plan to integrate the military forces of various countries can only be postponed for now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Slow step by step, slow step by step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, Hudson had no confidence in integrating the military forces of various countries, but now the probability of success is even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that this immature political action of the five grassland countries will completely hurt both sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, the five grassland countries have realized their mistakes. They not only apologized to the two majesties, but also promised to provide support when the two countries are restored in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, the five countries also announced that they would suspend all family visits during the continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I came to visit you today. In addition to coordinating the previous misunderstandings, I also negotiated the refugee issue entrusted by the five countries. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Landry's direct showdown made Hudson realize that the opponent had come prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom can buy off the representatives of the two countries, and the other party can also buy off the kings of the two countries. As long as the victim does not pursue the matter, the unpleasantness that happened earlier can be a misunderstanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transfer of family members has stopped, and the accusation of \"crime of desertion\" is also untenable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The present negotiation is mainly for profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are choices, no one wants to die. The dignitaries of the five grassland countries are even more unwilling to be buried with the newly born country that has little affection.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marquis, it is a good thing for the entire human race that the Five Grassland Kingdoms can come back from their lost ways, and I am also very pleased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just this kind of thing, you should talk to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instead of coming to me, the leader of the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is indeed very interested in refugees, but the more he wants to take over the people of the five prairie countries, the less he can show it at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other party came to him, obviously wanting to use him as a bargaining chip and use him to put pressure on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we will naturally talk. Today, on behalf of the five countries, I came to visit His Excellency the Marshal, mainly hoping that the Marshal can accept some refugees.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no shame in talking about interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sometimes it is easier to reach an agreement by directly stating the conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Marquis, there is no problem in accepting some refugees. But in my opinion, these are symptoms rather than the root cause.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The following content only represents my personal opinion and has nothing to do with the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The misunderstanding between us and the five grassland countries is easy to resolve, but the trouble is the aftermath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapse of the Principality of Shillong and the Principality of Omega caused hundreds of thousands of people to be displaced. A large number of people either died under the butcher knife of the orcs or died on the long road to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current war situation on the prairie is very unfavorable to the five prairie countries, and the front may collapse at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once a defeat occurs, more people will be displaced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of waiting for the tragedy to break out, it is better to transfer ordinary people to the rear for proper resettlement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the five grassland countries are restored, these preserved manpower will also be the main force for building the countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the difficulty of population migration, as the big country closest to the five kingdoms, I think the nobles of the kingdom will be willing to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, I suggest that you discuss with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom about how to operate and some details. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson suggested with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suggestions can be given, but he will never intervene in the specific content of the negotiation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to entrust the Alpha Kingdom to take care of the people of the five countries. I am afraid that these people will become Alpha people by the end of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Return the population, just listen to it. If it comes to specific implementation, how can you spit out what you eat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much you can pay back depends entirely on everyone's integrity. Even if the population is returned, it will only be a group of old, weak, sick and disabled who have lost their labor force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Future disputes and disputes are almost inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even in order to keep the interests in hand, it is not impossible for the kingdom to obstruct the restoration of the five kingdoms of the grassland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, you just talked about the people's problems, so what about the troops of the five grassland countries?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We are all very clear about the current situation, the five grassland kingdoms cannot last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries of the human race are all busy in the continental war, unable to provide them with more material assistance. Even if the orcs don't attack, it won't be long before the defenders will be trapped by supplies and collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the strategic materials are exhausted, evacuation becomes an inevitable choice. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Landry asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the serfs at the bottom, the big men obviously pay more attention to the army. These are all investments made by the major forces behind the Five Grasslands, and no one wants to waste money directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most practical issue, restoring the country requires strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no soldiers in hand, even if the orcs are driven out, a bachelor king will not be able to control the place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, the time has come for the five countries to withdraw, and the continental war has reached the most critical moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said that every military force is precious to the human race, so naturally it cannot be left idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that the Five Grassland Kingdoms need to keep their seeds and prepare for the restoration of the country later, middle and high-level noble officers can leave with their families, but ordinary officers and soldiers must stay. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a look of consideration for others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't know, these soldiers will be recruited by the Alpha Kingdom, maybe they really think it's out of justice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanted to open his mouth to refute, Marquis Landry took it back when the words came to his lips.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have been spread in the Terran Alliance Congress. If the five grassland countries continue to withdraw with a large number of troops, I am afraid that the discussion of \"crime of desertion\" will be put on the agenda again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't afford this crime, then the number of evacuated people must be controlled. At the very least, let the outside world look like they broke out by luck, instead of running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a good choice for the power that is destined to be abandoned to fall into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom. To avoid the sudden collapse of the Northern Continent war situation, it would affect the strategic layout of the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, the middle and high-level military officers are not enough, we must leave some guards for the five monarchs to show off!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Landry said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you pay attention, you will find that his fingers move a little, which seems to be implying something.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't answer directly, just smiled without saying a word. He naturally knows the bottom line of the kingdom, but it is absolutely impossible to reveal it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What kind of result can be negotiated depends on the next diplomatic game between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After seeing off Marquis Landry, he was taken to a meeting in the palace before he had time to adjust his thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See Navy Fleet intends to go north!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Focused on wars with orcs all year round, the kingdom's sea power mainly comes from the private armies of coastal nobles, and the kingdom's navy can be regarded as an \"existent fleet\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to fight pirates once in a while, but if you want to compete with the Holy See's navy, the gap between them is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the addition of the power of the coastal nobles, there is still a certain gap between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if the Holy See fleet really comes to kill, as a local snake, it is not completely powerless to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering the kingdom's maritime military power, and mobilizing some experts to go there, there is still a chance to severely damage the Holy See Navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the expedition of Laoshi is very expensive, and the Holy See also has its own maritime interests that need to be protected by the fleet, so it cannot stay on the coast of the kingdom for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even during the worst period of the relationship between the two sides, the Holy See did not form an expeditionary fleet to kill them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, \"military blackmail\" appeared in Hudson's mind. This wave of actions by the Holy See is obviously supporting the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this country is filled with a large number of descendants of the Holy See dignitaries, unlike several other countries, although the backstage is not small, most of them are collateral descendants of various families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See sent a note. They are fighting against pirates, and they want to send troops to help us clear up the ghost ships in the misty sea area to ensure the smooth flow of routes.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Earl Francis' words fell to the ground, everyone's expressions turned ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no such thing as **** of the sea in the continent of Aslante, everyone still acquiesces in their respective spheres of influence, and the behavior of the Holy See has obviously crossed the line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A combination of soft and hard, this is to force the kingdom to make concessions!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now is the period of the continental war, the Holy See should not dare to provoke a civil war among the human race without authorization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hunt for the ghost ship must be sped up. If it takes too long to find it, then the hunt will be suspended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The negotiations between    and the five grassland countries cannot be affected. If we threaten this kind of thing, as long as we compromise once, there will be countless times in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See Fleet wants to go north, so let them come up!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance Council is watching. Even if the air route is clear, does the Kingdom of Light dare to run away? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said with a sneer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a great humiliation for the kingdom to let the Holy See enter the sphere of its own strength, but no matter how great the grievance is, it is better than a direct compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unable to start a fight, the Holy See fleet can actually do not much except to show off its force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, shall we not fight back?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked rather annoyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of useless decision is not suitable for the king to make, but the prime minister's self-assessment still makes him unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, what made him even more angry was the provocation from the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom suffered a loss, and the first to bear the brunt was the damage to his authority as the king. In the era of Caesar III, the Holy See did not do this kind of thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the overall situation is the most important thing!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the situation in the kingdom is difficult...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ministers persuaded Caesar IV one after another, making Caesar IV want to cry without tears. Isn't it just to vent my inner dissatisfaction, why is it endless!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended not to see the grievance of his own king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, conflicts with the Holy See were all confrontations between two major forces. To put it bluntly, they were all business affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two major forces clamored fiercely, but for the individuals among them, the influence was actually not that great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The center of the dispute this time is the descendants of the Holy See dignitaries, which has already involved personal grievances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the treasure hunt team's disappearance was superimposed, which intensified the conflict between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the Holy See is only guessing about the news about the artifact. If it is confirmed, their reaction will be even more intense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the Holy See fleet going north is a humiliation for the kingdom, but it is an opportunity for him personally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since he followed him, the ghost ship has not sailed once, and the ghosts who love robbery are feeling wronged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm ashamed to play tricks on my own people, but he has no pressure to cheat the Holy See. Anyway, they all came to encircle and suppress the ghost ship, and it was reasonable to be attacked by the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making up their minds to attract people from the Holy See, Hudson naturally wanted to add fire to help them make up their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the prime minister's proposal is very pertinent. We must not compromise on the Kingdom of Light at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the kingdom's reputation, we can't lower the conditions, but instead specifically raise the requirements for the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't need to be too much, just a little higher than the others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe with such a stimulus, the other four will directly reach an agreement with us, and the remaining Kingdom of Light will be unable to support itself, and it will definitely not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the fleet of the Holy See going north to destroy the ghost ship, then let them be fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to release the news, saying that the ghost ship is lurking in the depths of the misty sea, let them go in and search it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most experienced veteran captain cannot guarantee free access to the foggy sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case they get unlucky and get lost inside, it's not our fault!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Hudson's proposal, Caesar IV was shocked, and instantly made up his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See does something at this time, the Terran Alliance will definitely interfere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Kingdom of Light, they may not be able to withstand the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the Alpha Kingdom is only targeting ordinary soldiers and serfs, and will not hurt those second generations at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if a parent is angry, he will not turn his face immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if the \"scepter of glory\" is involved, it will be different. Unless he handed over the artifact immediately, people from the Holy See would come to him sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV, who was already guilty, had already confirmed that the news of the artifact had leaked out. It was just a test made by the Holy See before he was sure that the item was in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See's fleet is going north, and we really can't stop it. It's just that the misty sea is so dangerous, can it bury a powerful fleet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked uncertainly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to professional knowledge, the Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero, stepped forward and replied:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the misty sea area itself is not dangerous, and there are no powerful sea monsters entrenched. The dangerous thing is that the area covered by the fog is too large.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the ship enters it, all navigation tools will lose their effectiveness. Except for a poisonous dragon island in the center, there is no point of reference anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times it seems to be heading in one direction, but affected by the fog, you don't know if you are going astray.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even entering it with a fleet, ships can get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See's fleet goes deep into it, I dare not say that it will definitely get lost, but heavy losses are still inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is the case of unfamiliar places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a guide who is familiar with this sea area to lead the way, and the magician on board drives away the fog all the way, there is hope for a safe retreat. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, everyone turned their attention to several coastal lords, hoping to get a definite answer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency the Grand Duke is right. Under normal circumstances, as long as the Holy See is well prepared, it will be able to come out of the sea of ​​fog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the current situation is a little different. There are still three extremely dangerous ghost ships entrenched in the misty sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people have seen them on the edge of the fog. The coalition forces tried to go in and encircle them several times, but they had to give up in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fog will not affect the actions of these monsters, but in order to avoid accidentally injuring their own people, the magic crystal cannon on the ship is useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If people from the Holy See dare to go in, they will definitely pay a heavy price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, no matter how many magicians they have on board, it is impossible to disperse the thick fog in the entire sea area, and there will always be opportunities for the ghost ship to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter who wins or loses, there is one less hidden danger for the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See really wiped out the ghost ship, the Holy See fleet would suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we are lucky, maybe we can go up and make up the last knife. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Dalton family suffered heavy losses in the last encirclement and suppression of \"pirates\". He paid a heavy price, but in the end he didn't even get a hair.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pirates were cultivated by the Holy See, and this account will naturally fall on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially when artifacts were involved, the Dalton family must bear the brunt of the conflict between the future kingdom and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Destined to face each other, rather than waiting for the enemy to attack, it is better to make arrangements in advance to severely damage the Holy See's sea power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See wants to take revenge, it will have to build another fleet. The shortest time period for this period must be in years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the enemies of the Holy See are not only the Alpha Kingdom. Once the sea fleet suffers heavy losses, their overseas trade will inevitably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maritime trade is damaged, fiscal revenue will inevitably decline, and correspondingly, military expenditures that can be invested in the navy will also decrease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many maritime powers have declined after a major defeat. It's not that they don't want to struggle, but mainly because they have no way to recover their strength in time under the vicious circle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One step at night, the benefits are divided up by others. The gap in strength between the two sides has widened, and the probability of getting back the original benefits is getting slimmer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a moment, Caesar IV finally nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The ghost ship is indeed very powerful, but it is also a piece of fat in the eyes of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many treasures on the continent of Aslant to assist cultivation, but the treasure that can help people understand the law is rare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the limited scope of use, I am afraid that the strong from all over the continent will flock to it, even if they stay in the misty sea area, it may not be safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, no one has ventured deep into the misty sea, that is because the dark-type powerhouses who arrived in the early stage are all natives of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all people in the same circle. After a little inquiring, you can know the danger of the misty sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Treasures are precious, but small lives are more expensive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation will be different when outsiders come over. It is also not surprising to get the opposite result if you go to inquire about the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One death counts as one death, and if there is a chance to clean up competitors without a trace, local snakes will not be soft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The net went down, and Hudson continued to start his military training career. From the initial physical training to individual combat training, it has now entered the final stage - the military formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the training of the private army back then, Hudson can command it himself, and the kingdom's standing army can number more than 200,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you gather people together, the area of ​​the training ground will not be smaller than the capital. Ninety-nine percent of the soldiers could not hear even if they shouted their throats.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is inevitable to distribute training tasks to noble officers. It's just a little different from the previous training, the military formation training is much more complicated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson gave the order and explained it very clearly, few people still understood it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a last resort, Hudson had no choice but to return to his old job. He visited the military academy instructor for a while, and first called the officers together for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the gloomy faces of a group of noble officers, like soldiers on the training ground, waving the spears in their hands rigidly, the surrounding dignitaries of the royal capital couldn't bear to look directly at them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, spectator training can also be learned, but in order to impress everyone, Marshal Hudson specially stipulated that officers must participate in the training in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocratic demeanor, forget it! When it comes to the training ground, no matter how high the nobles are, they are still soldiers. As a kingdom in war, the Alpha Kingdom has never raised delicate people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overall quality of the officers is still good. After eliminating a few laggards, the rest have shown super learning ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you are unhappy, learn to be free early. If you can't learn it, you have to train on the court all the time. It's a trivial matter to be embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the performance is too unbearable, unable to keep up with the training progress, there is a risk of being kicked out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to get into the current position, and no one wants to be demoted because of \"incompetence\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher the officer, the greater the pressure. The current status does not allow them to appear \"labeled of incompetence\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The harsh training standards made all the officers tormented enough, but the nobles from all walks of life who watched and stole the teacher were very excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally learned something real!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is also a military formation in the Kingdom's army, but it is limited to lining up in a row to attack. Once the two armies are at war, the free battle mode will soon be activated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation on the training ground is obviously different. It looks like an ordinary square formation, but in fact there are small army formations inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they are merged together, they can form a large square formation to fight; after they are split, they can also be transformed into countless small army formations to fight alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous shaking of the command flag, the formation also changed regularly, like giant dragons, constantly wandering on the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows how to fight, and is very clear about the significance of this kind of cooperation in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You have heard of these unpredictable military formations, and even sent people to steal divisions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that I don't know what went wrong, and finally learned a four-in-one, the power can't compare with the genuine army array on the training ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hudson, you are really willing to give up! These things that can be passed down through the ages have been directly brought out. Aren't you afraid that everyone will learn from them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Oran asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although this knowledge is not his, everything that Hudson owns will eventually be left to his grandson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he thought of his grandson's unique inheritance, which was shared by everyone, Earl Oran couldn't help but feel a pain in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Ha ha…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Your Excellency Earl, don't look at the unpredictable formations on the training ground. It seems to be infinitely powerful, but in fact it cannot be replicated on a large scale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The quality of ordinary soldiers is far inferior to these officers, and it would be good if they can learn to form formations. It is almost impossible to expect them to make such flexible changes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the family private army that I have trained for many years, they are also slightly inferior in the use of formations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of complicated formation is not prepared for soldiers at all. Let everyone conduct a drill now, mainly to let them feel the power of the military formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who's private army's quality can be compared with this group of officers on the whole, and the results were stolen, I also recognize it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson laughed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stealing also depends on the situation. If you blindly follow suit without considering the actual situation, you will only bring yourself to humiliation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the officers have almost learned it, when they go back to train ordinary soldiers, they will find that the most suitable is the best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, Alpha Kingdom's wonderful operation suddenly pushed the Holy See to the foot of the wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, they only planned to use force to demonstrate to make the Alpha people make concessions on the issue of the Kingdom of Light, but they didn't expect them to just pretend to be confused.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See said to crack down on pirates, and the Alpha people replied: Pirates are too abominable, they must all be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See said that it would go north to encircle and suppress the ghost ship, and the Alpha people replied: the ghost ship is in the foggy sea area, be careful when the fog is thick on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The talk is all about this, if you don't go, wouldn't it appear that the Holy See is very cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if military action is really taken, there will be a bunch of new troubles to solve. Although the Holy See's naval fleet is powerful, it also has great maritime interests that need to be maintained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few heretics, most countries are paying tithes to the Holy See. The main reason is their strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially for those small coastal countries that pay taxes in full, the deterrence of the naval fleet has played a key role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to deterring all countries, the interests of the Holy See at sea also need protection from its own fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the main fleet leaves, the competitors will not miss this opportunity to add chaos. Although they will not hit the door directly, it is still possible for remote control pirates to attack their fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These small-scale means of fighting are still based on the fact that the strength of the main fleet of the Holy See has not been damaged. If this trip suffers heavy losses, there will be more troubles in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think of the Alpha people's reaction?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that the fleet going north at this moment would definitely not be smooth sailing. But he was too excited in the front, and said all the words in the scene. It's not easy for him, the Pope, to slap himself in the face!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Alpha people are so rampant, they clearly believe that I dare not take action during the continental war, so they have no fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we stop at this moment, not only will the disappearance of the treasure hunting team become a headless case, but the prestige that my Holy See has accumulated on the mainland over the years will also be destroyed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since they choose to pretend to be stupid, then we will simply let them go and send a fleet to investigate the disappearance of the treasure hunting team under the pretext of going north to encircle and suppress the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait for the evidence to be found, and then argue with the Alpha people to see how long they can keep their mouths stubborn! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake has always been a hardliner when he met the Alpha Kingdom, an old enemy who made him vomit blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this old enemy is not weak in his own strength, has not shown a fatal flaw, and the international situation has not left them a chance to retaliate, so it has been delayed until now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Investigating the disappearance of the treasure hunting team is just an excuse to the inside. Anyone with a little bit of political savvy knows that two major incidents involving the loss of artifacts are involved, and the case of the disappearance of the treasure hunting team must be handled in a low-key manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, I already know that there is a shadow of an Alpha person behind me, just find an opportunity to retaliate later, there is no need to ignite this political thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of force intimidation is essentially to stand for the second generation. They are all parents, and no one wants a white-haired person to give a blond one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Blake, you are still as reckless as ever. The Alpha people let us go north, who knows what conspiracy is behind it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that the ghost ship can be found in one of the top ten dangerous places in the mainland—the sea of ​​fog. If you want to investigate the disappearance of the treasure hunting team, you have to go deep into the legendary Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha people are local snakes, and they know the situation in the misty sea area like the back of their hands. If we set up a trap inside and wait for us to jump in, we will suffer a lot if we don't notice it for a while! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Gu Lei's analysis, everyone's faces were ugly. According to past experience, going to the Alpha people's sphere of influence and fighting against them usually doesn't lead to any good results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See also has a copy of the information on the Misty Sea Area, but the content of the records is very thin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sea of ​​Fog: The fog is thick and easy to get lost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island: Infested with poisonous insects, extremely dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then there is no after. A sea area shrouded in fog all year round, plus an island full of poisonous insects, who is full and has nothing to do, so go to research every day?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The financial and human resources of the Holy See are also limited, and it is impossible to explore every corner of the world. The misty sea area that has little value will naturally not become the focus of attention of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"So what if there is a conspiracy? At this point, is it possible that we can back down and announce to the outside world that we are not free to encircle and suppress the ghost ship?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Blake said disdainfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not a big deal to save face, and there are still a lot of second generations trapped in the Kingdom of Light. Shrinking at this moment, God knows how many will come back in the end?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A similar thing had already happened on the prairie once before. In the tragedies of the Principality of Omega and Principality of Shillong, the Kingdom of Light played the most disgraceful role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First they fooled their allies into withdrawing to their own territory, and then detained some of the opponent's monarchs, forcing the withdrawn troops to serve as cannon fodder on the battlefield. They all set a precedent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to act so boldly, it is naturally determined by the living environment. Accustomed to pointing out the country in the Holy See, none of them took the Principality's monarch at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's nothing to temporarily detain people. When the Holy See was glorious, it sent the king directly to the barbecue grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Growing up after studying these great achievements, I have long been accustomed to the supremacy of theocracy, and my behavior is inevitably a little out of line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It cannot be said to be stupid, at least militarily, these actions are desirable. Relying on the cannon fodder from neighboring countries greatly reduced the loss of the Kingdom of Light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that they were not very lucky. They met neighbors who were also evil, and wanted to copy their actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let the First Fleet, Second Fleet, and Fourth Fleet go north, leaving the Third Fleet to guard the home.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This operation must be straightforward. Our main goal is to find out the disappearance of the treasure hunting team, and the second is to ensure the smooth flow of the route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The eighth-level powerhouses of the dark department all act with the army. If you encounter a ghost ship, you can take care of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that there are three eighth-tier ghost ships roaming the foggy seas, as the rumors say, maybe we can add a strong sanctuary. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Typical political discourse, smart people know that the investigation of the disappearance of the treasure hunting team is a cover. The account has long been recorded in the Alpha Kingdom, and there is no need to reverse the case for the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, it is the secondary task behind. Whether it is to ensure the smooth flow of the route, or to destroy the ghost ship to seize the chance of the sanctuary, it is more important than the final case of the disappearance of the treasure hunting team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are a large number of masters in the treasure hunting team, which is one of the core strengths of the Holy See, that is only when they are alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dead people are worthless. It is enough to find the murderer and wait for the opportunity to avenge them. It is completely meaningless to spend a lot of manpower and material resources to find out how they died.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elements are changing, the enemy is releasing a forbidden spell, and the magician group hastened to interrupt it!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg, who noticed something was wrong, hurriedly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the magicians in the city had already noticed something was wrong, but they were suppressed by the enemy to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone messes up the elemental sea together, there is no forbidden spell that can interrupt the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When this happens, there is only one way to explain that the magicians who released the forbidden spell outside the city are far stronger than them. Even if there is a small chaos in the elemental sea, it will not affect their release of the forbidden spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation of the marshal is not good. The magicians outside the city are too powerful. We can't interrupt the enemy's spellcasting. It may be that the elves have joined the battle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the city defense magic circle can weaken the enemy's magic attack, it cannot stop the forbidden spell. Order our people to withdraw to the next line of defense, there is no need to make meaningless sacrifices! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The white-haired old man said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After fighting with the army of the ancient survivors for such a long time, I have roughly figured out the opponent's strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, although the Northern Continent Allied Forces are at a disadvantage, they are able to kill all of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now the magic power of the enemy has suddenly skyrocketed. Either there are new ancient survivors joining the war, or the elves paddling water have provided them with support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter what the situation is, the immediate defense line is on the verge of collapse. Even if the defenders endured the loss and gritted their teeth and persevered, they still couldn't withstand the successive magical curses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master Jesse, what forbidden spell is the enemy casting? How long will it take for it to fall?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Borg just finished speaking, the old man's face changed drastically again, and he said in a panic:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is another forbidden curse brewing, the elves must have joined the battle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dare to release two forbidden curses at such a short distance at the same time, without fear of interference with each other, at least a dozen or so great magisters from the same department must work together to be able to control it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army retreats to the next line of defense!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Master Jesse finished speaking, Marshal Borg hurriedly ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One forbidden curse is very fatal, and another forbidden curse is obviously not intended to make people live.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to these, the more important thing is that the elves participate in the war. After all, the Warhammer Kingdom has already lost many lines of defense, and it doesn't matter if they lose one more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can hold it, you will hold it, if you can't hold it, you will retreat. Those with a bad mentality had already met the Lord of Dawn during the last round of orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the opponent's forbidden spell, the army retreated very smoothly. The coalition forces of the ancient survivors originally wanted to chase after it, but once the forbidden curse was activated, it could not be stopped, otherwise it would backfire on their own magicians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, troops are sent to pursue the enemy army. The forbidden curse for attacking the enemy is likely to fall on their own army.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Now it is nothing more than the fact that they joined the war earlier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Magicians have a special status in the army, and they have always been the focus of protection by all parties, and the probability of death is relatively small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the standpoint of the elves, sending magicians to help allies fight is actually a very cost-effective behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Joining the war ahead of time, perhaps the elves are aware of the danger and realize that this continental war is different from the past. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson took the lead in breaking the silence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how uncertain he is, at a time like this, he, the commander in chief of the army, cannot panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The unity of the kingdom is based on the premise that we can overcome the crisis by helping each other. If there is no hope in sight, everyone will inevitably have to fend for themselves in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the dignitaries of various countries on the front line, one can tell that those nobles have secretly transferred some of their children long ago, and only the ostensible strength of each family appeared on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If everyone is willing to work hard, the coalition forces on the western front will not be scared back again and again by a few forbidden spells.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the magician group sent by the elves is powerful, they did not exceed the limit after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The large-scale magic cast by the magic circle cannot stop once it starts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, under the backlash of the forbidden curse, the people in the main formation will almost certainly die, and the rest of the casters will be seriously injured if they don't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the coalition forces are willing to work hard, they can directly rush out to fight the enemy bloody. They don't expect to defeat the enemy, they just need to get closer to destroy the spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's only a short distance away, and the enemy's magician can't run away during the casting process. Even if the enemy desperately intercepts it, it's nothing more than a life for a life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is completely feasible strategically to take away a group of magicians from the enemy with a large army with heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you do it a few times, the elves will definitely not be able to stand it. They just came to help, not to exchange lives with the Human Race coalition forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, why the elves joined the war earlier is not important at all now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The key is that if they participate in the war, the Western Front is doomed to fail.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, at most two months later, the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom will all fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Western Warhammer Kingdom is mountainous, and the situation is slightly better, but it doesn't help the overall situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom is destroyed, the coalition forces of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants and the Elven Race can enter the Principality of Moxi and threaten the kingdom's western front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    National countries in the northern continent can't count on it. We have put in so much effort before, and the countries have only sent a small amount of reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the situation is collapsing, everyone will only take care of themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they know that after the front line collapses, the flames of war will burn on their own heads, and all countries can only take care of their own eyes first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Rodriguez said in a deep voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't panic. Once the kingdom's western front is threatened, the southwestern provinces must take care of their own safety first, and the orcs in the north can only be faced by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly recovered seven provinces of the kingdom seem to have a large territory, but the local emerging nobles are all in the stage of primitive accumulation of strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being able to delay the enemy army for two or three months is because everyone is working hard, and the final pressure will still fall on the five major families in the Northland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Die if you can't stop it. With their embarrassing status in the kingdom's aristocratic circle, there is no second way to choose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before they supported Hudson, the \"enemy\", as the coach, the main reason was the strategy of first going north and then going west.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Duke Rodriguez, what you said is not wrong at all. Under normal circumstances, the elves will definitely not be able to defend the Western Front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there are exceptions to everything. The coalition forces of the ancient survivors can attack the kingdom from the Principality of Moxi, and it is also possible to sweep across other countries in the Northern Continent from the Principality of Orton.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the elves also send out large-scale troops to destroy the Principality of Kantruo, the Principality of Ustad, and the Principality of Fick, and the two go south after the completion of the reunion in the Principality of Orton, there will be no force in the North Continent to stop them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves have a limited population and a limited demand for land. Even if there is ambition to expand, the three duchies of Cantrue, Ustad, and Fick together are enough for them to digest for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The internal situation of the Remnants of the Ancients is more complicated, requiring a lot of land in the sun, but the Warhammer Kingdom can also choke them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, do you guess that they will join forces to invade the kingdom, or go south to help the alien alliance? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under Hudson's deliberate guidance, everyone looked much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The populations of the elves and the ancient survivors are not large, and neither of them has the strength to engulf the entire northern continent in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, even if they invaded the Alpha Kingdom, they were making wedding dresses for orcs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, for these theories to be established, there must be a premise—the elves really want to save the Alien Alliance, and they cannot waste too much time on the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, if the kingdom is not the target of the elves, should we refuse the Mosi's request for help?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if it's because of political incompetence, or because he deliberately applied eye drops, but Duke Hiero's question made Caesar IV very upset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of decision-making involving the life and death of the kingdom, why do you have to ask the king first, how can the marshal make the decision?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, everyone's focus is on Hudson, and there is no time to pay attention to his king's thoughts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He can only hold back his displeasure. If he is really asked to make a decision, Caesar IV will also panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When life and death are at stake, any misjudgment in any detail will bring huge losses to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Reinforcements still need to be sent. Judging from the current situation, if there is no battle on the western front, it may be hard to be safe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific number of troops to send and how to fight this battle will be decided after I meet with the envoys of the Mosi people to understand the details.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You don't need to worry too much. Among the three major alien races in the Northern Continent, the weakest one is the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look at them as a whole now, when they were huddled in the world of ice and snow in the past, in order to compete for limited survival resources, there were many conflicts among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our human race alliance can't unify the interests and appeals. I don't believe that the alliance composed of many ancient races can reconcile internal conflicts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before taking down the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, they still had a common goal. Once they took it down, the situation changed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe some races want to go further and get a wider living space; but there are also many races that are satisfied with the status quo and just want to get a piece of fertile land to recuperate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During consecutive victories, these internal contradictions can still be suppressed, but once a major defeat occurs on the battlefield, the contradictions will be exposed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless the alien race alliance wins this continental war and pulls our human race from the position of the continent's overlord, otherwise no alien race will want to be our neighbor! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said pretending to be calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't understand the situation, you may think that the Alpha Kingdom is sure of victory and can destroy the coalition forces of the ancient survivors at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson has no idea how many reinforcements should be sent now and how to fight this battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It wasn't that he was incompetent, it was mainly because he rushed to the palace as soon as he received the news, and he didn't even have a half-knowledge of the situation on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Strategies and decisions are made thousands of miles away, which is based on an in-depth understanding of the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The information in Hudson's hands now is still the content collected by the kingdom before. The situation is changing so fast, who can guarantee that the current alliance of the ancient survivors is still the original loose alliance?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including the understanding of the elves, intelligence work is also very lagging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the extraordinary world, many things cannot be deduced by just using benefit analysis and inherent logic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the legendary elf goddess issues an oracle, the elves who are addicted to art can also become killing machines.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or some treasure is obtained, which increases the fertility of the elves, and they will immediately become the main force fighting for the hegemony of the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Or a cult organization doing something to confuse the officers on the front line can also cause a change in the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"In addition to the problem on the western front, the problem on the southeast coast has also arrived. The Holy See fleet has already set off and is expected to arrive in half a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We have released the rumors, and the momentum has been built for the Holy See, but it is still unknown whether they will enter the misty sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal, you fought a ghost ship. If the Holy See's fleet meets them in the misty sea, how much trouble can it cause the Holy See? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the new white hair on Earl Pierce's head, Hudson knew that he hadn't worried much recently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about it is right, the Holy See treasure hunting fleet is missing, and they are the number one suspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the Holy See pursues it, sooner or later it will be traced to the Dalton family fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was Hudson who did the trick, no one would believe this kind of thing!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, they were not totally uninvolved. At least they destroyed the pirate ship, cut off the return of the treasure hunting team, and incidentally shared the credit for contributing the artifact to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With this credit, when the Holy See is established in the future, they will most likely be able to add the word \"Holy\" before the family title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also a matter of course for the recommended personnel to obtain a high position in the new Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The benefits are all predetermined, so the revenge of the Holy See will naturally be inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of their own safety, it is undoubtedly the best choice for the kingdom to stand in front of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are no surprises. Hudson is behind the action plan against the Holy See. In essence, the two are singing a double reed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, those three ghost ships are not easy. Ordinary attacks have no lethality to them at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In particular, they also have a set of secret methods that can raise the three ghost kings to the sanctuary level in a short period of time. Coupled with the characteristics of the ghost itself, it is almost impossible to attack ordinary eighth-level powerhouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At sea that day, dozens of warships cooperated, but we were unable to keep them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After entering the sea of ​​mist, the magic crystal cannon can't aim at the target, and the warship is almost like an ordinary merchant ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are many magicians accompanying the Holy See, they can dispel the fog, but they cannot resist the continuous flow of fog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially at night, I am afraid that the ghost ship is approaching, and they may not be able to find it in time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghost ship is not destroyed, and the ghost is not destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fighting these immortal monsters, once the magic crystal cannon cannot be used, ordinary soldiers are useless at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to destroy the ghost ship, you can only cast a destructive single-target forbidden spell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghosts are not stupid, they will run away if they can't win. With the cover of thick fog, it is difficult for the forbidden spell to hit the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of whether the ghost ship can be wiped out, the Holy See's fleet will suffer heavy losses. If they are unlucky and get lost in it, or break into the dangerous unknown unknown sea area, the whole army may be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All we need to do is make up the knife at the critical moment. If the loss of the Holy See fleet is not large, then temporarily terminate the plan. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried his best to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the ghost ship \"rob\" the Holy See fleet by itself, there must be no chance of winning, but he is the manipulator behind the scenes!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we need to strengthen the confidence of the kingdom, let everyone work hard to lure the enemy into the misty sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The greater the Holy See's losses, the greater the Hudson's gains. Feeding the ghost ship is second, the key is to be able to make the danger of the misty sea deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one dared to go, it became his back garden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a large sea area, it is impossible to have no value at all. At worst, there is also a hidden overseas base where some shady things can be stored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the grassland, the orc army suddenly stepped up its offensive, and the pressure on the surviving human nations increased greatly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Philip I was very speechless at the moment. The orcs seemed to have a life-and-death enmity with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason is very clear to him. It is nothing more than that they control the only large port on the prairie. Only by taking this place can they cut off the support of the Human Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The orcs are crazy, and they don't give us a chance to breathe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has to hurry up. Our negotiations with the Alpha Kingdom must be accelerated. If it is slower, it will soon become the Four Kingdoms of the Grassland! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Philip I said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An out-of-control diplomatic dispute broke his evacuation plan. Deep down, he has already greeted all the dignitaries of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, the negotiation must continue. Every time one more force is withdrawn, the odds of winning the country will increase by one point in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the fight is complete, even if the country is really restored in the future, he will not be able to control the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the fleet of the Holy See has already gone north, and the Alpha people should not dare to block the route. Can we...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Minister of Foreign Affairs finished speaking, Philip I interrupted; \"They will not block the route, they will just cause accidents to our fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the ghost ship they are besieging is the best object to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, people from the Holy See can be trusted?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even their existence is a threat in itself!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget where we come from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the eyes of the Holy See, you and I are heretics. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Irrationality is not acceptable, my brother is a strongman who declared the pope illegal. Being on the front line of the confrontation between monarchy and theocracy, there is no possibility of any relaxation between the two sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how ugly the food in the Alpha Kingdom was, they didn't dare to kill him. They even entertained him with good wine and meat, and sent him back to the country according to the rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    fell into the hands of the Holy See, lucky enough to become a bargaining chip, unlucky and directly buried in the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The crime of regicide is personally stressful, but the wind and waves at sea don't matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult for the Holy See to create an accidental killing of chickens and monkeys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, if you want to speed up the progress of the negotiations, you must make major concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha people's fleet has appeared in the open sea, waiting to receive refugees. If I release a little sincerity first, it will be of great help to the subsequent negotiations. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dony suggested along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet did come, but it did not represent the Alpha Kingdom, but a fleet temporarily hired by Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stealing people has always been quick, but slow. Hudson, who is familiar with the rules of the game, will naturally plan ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this time, it is necessary to test the relationship between people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the head of logistics during the war against the Orc Empire, Hudson's social circle is not small. Doni, who also participated in the last war, had a little relationship with Hudson because he had received food and grass a few times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, such a relationship is useless, but the situation is different now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dony didn't want to destroy his family property that he had painstakingly accumulated, and Hudson also focused on the refugees from the prairie countries. The representatives of the two parties communicated in private, and they hit it off and finalized the cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Philip I, who didn't know that the people under his hand had made a deal, only thought it was needed for negotiations, naturally would not reject such a proposal that would help solve the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then send them some refugees first, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will handle the specific situation at its own discretion. Everything is in the interests of the kingdom!\"\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Even if the enemy threatens with the forbidden curse, there must be so many magicians to release the forbidden curse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the forbidden curse was brewed and could not be taken back, so the magician who released the forbidden curse once had to cultivate for ten days and a half months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson does not believe that the enemy can come up with dozens of forbidden spells a day. If it is so powerful, there will be no need to fight the next battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, after confirming that the elves joined the battle, the whole army was in panic, allowing the enemy to seize the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the coalition headquarters reacted and took action to appease the morale of the army, the three front lines of defense were all torn open.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warhammer Kingdom was not well prepared in advance. Except for the completion of the first three defense lines, the rear defense lines were incomplete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army suffered heavy losses, and now they can only rely on the noble castles along the way to resist steadily. Without reinforcements, the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom would not last long. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Raquel said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From a second-generation dude to the backbone of the Principality's army, he is no longer the military rookie he used to be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The test of war and fire has greatly improved Viscount Raquel's vision, and he knows very well what the fall of the East Warhammer Kingdom means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one knows how the enemy will advance in the future. Anyway, the Principality of Moxi dare not gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tragedy of being beaten by the orcs back then has not been able to repair the sequelae, and the Moxi Principality does not want to have it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, keeping the enemy out of the country is only an illusion after all. Facing the coalition forces of the Elf Clan and the Ancient Remnant Clan Alliance, the Northern Continent simply couldn't find a force to contend with.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, seeking help from the Alpha Kingdom is also a dead horse as a living horse doctor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How many elf armies appear on the battlefield?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have already happened. Whether the coalition forces were defeated by the enemy or collapsed by panic, the situation they need to face is the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the strength of the participation of the elves is the key to determining the follow-up war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Elf army?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this word, Raquel was slightly taken aback, and then explained:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the elves only sent a group of magicians and some guards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the number is not many, all of them are powerful.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We once sent out masters to sneak attack, trying to destroy the enemy's spellcasting. As a result, several eighth-level powerhouses were killed by the enemy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After getting the exact answer, Hudson was very speechless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the inconvenience of his status, he really wanted to greet the senior generals on the front line and what they did for food.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to fight for your life, you have to rush forward with a large army, or use the magic crystal cannon to greet the mage group. Sending a few masters just wants to kill them. I really think the opponent is a fool, without even the most basic defense?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It crashed for thousands of miles, who do you want to show it to?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries of the human race are very busy at the moment, and it is simply impossible to expect everyone to send troops to the North Continent to clean up the mess before finishing their own affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current situation is that persistence may not necessarily win the victory, but it must be cool if it is bad. Once they lose their roots, exile will definitely teach them to be human.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have already figured out the matter, you guys go to rest first. The question of reinforcements can only be answered after the kingdom discusses it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said perfunctorily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he had already secretly calculated. The battlefield on the Western Front suddenly collapsed, and the original strategy of first going north and then going west went bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it depends on the choice of the foreign coalition forces. If they took the road all the way south from the Principality of Orton, then the Alpha Kingdom could still pretend to be deaf and dumb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they continue to invade the Principality of Moxi, the Alpha Kingdom must send reinforcements for the strategic security of its own rear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First blitz the ancient survivors' allied forces, and then turn around and deal with the orcs?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea is very good, but when it comes to actual implementation, it becomes very difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a little carelessness, I was dragged on the Western Front and could not get out. When the time comes to fight on two fronts, all the pressure will be concentrated on the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander-in-chief of the army, Hudson was really panicked at this moment. Whether or not to make a risky move and take a big gamble really made it difficult for him to decide.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, are you serious about dispatching 50,000 elite troops to attack the coalition forces of the ancient survivors?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked in disbelief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to mobilize an army of 50,000, but the difficulty is to defeat the coalition forces of the ancient survivors in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even with the cooperation of the coalition forces of various countries, the enemy is strong and we are weak. It is not easy to stabilize the front line by attacking the strong with the weak, not to mention defeating the enemy in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows about the situation on the Western Front. The most optimistic estimate is to send reinforcements to help the Principality of Moxi stabilize the front line, or delay their collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Defeat the enemy army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you think about it? Even if the elves don't intervene, the coalition forces of the ancient survivors are not a soft persimmon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, as long as the coalition forces of the ancient survivors send troops to the Principality of Moxi, the kingdom will have no choice. If you don't want to be dragged to death on the battlefield, you can only resort to dangerous tactics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current situation, the elves may really want to go south to rescue the Alien Alliance, but the Ancient Remnant Alliance may want to eat the Principality of Moxi more.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We cannot bet on the limits of their ambition. The best choice is to strike first, destroy the ambitions of the alliance of the ancient survivors, and let them understand that it is a wrong choice to be neighbors with the kingdom. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, Hudson only said half of what he said. If the ambitions of the Ancient Remnant Race Alliance were defeated, they could only choose to attach themselves to the elves and go south to rescue the Alien Race Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the Alpha Kingdom will let them go south. At that time, several kingdoms in the mainland will be scolding their mothers. This is a proper way to cheat teammates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, we have no doubts about the strategic issue. The crux of the problem now is, can only 50,000 elites and the coalition forces of various countries extinguish the ambitions of the alliance of the ancient survivors?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Grand Duke of Newfoundland asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you win, you are pouring cold water on the enemy; if you lose, you are pouring fuel on the fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the performance of the senior generals present, they all lowered their heads and tried to reduce their sense of existence. Obviously, they did not have the confidence to take on this challenging task.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, you are wrong. The only thing we can rely on is our own 50,000 elite.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The morale of the coalition forces of various countries is now low. Gathering with them will only reduce the chances of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are valued in quality, not in numbers; generals are valued in strategy, not in fierceness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am going to personally go to direct this operation. However, before the outbreak of the war, the strategic purpose must be hidden, and it should be regarded as an ordinary reinforcement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be on the safe side, it's best to lie to your allies together. As long as the enemy is not prepared in advance, the probability of success of this operation is 50%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have fought in the Principality of Moxi, and I am very familiar with the terrain there. If the battlefield is in the Principality of Moxi, then the probability of winning can be increased by another 10%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army is all elite, even if the military operation fails strategically, it will not suffer tactically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take a gamble, no matter whether you win or lose, the situation will not be worse than it is now. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A 60% chance of winning is already very high. In such a dangerous moment, you can gamble with a 30% chance of winning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a kingdom on chariots, the Alpha Kingdom has never lacked gambling. In the past history, the kingdom has gambled more than once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that in the past, there was a human race alliance behind it. Even if you lose all your chips, you can make a comeback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This continental war is obviously different. The bottom line of the human race countries has dropped again and again. If the alien race at the doorstep is destroyed and the strategic situation changes, no one can say whether they will support the restoration of the country that was destroyed in the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's high-level officials who have no idea about their allies really don't want to gamble. However, the situation is not in control, if you don't want to be dragged to death in the war of attrition, you can only gamble once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal is right, we have no choice. Whether it is military pressure or logistical pressure, the kingdom does not have the ability to fight on two fronts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can clearly tell you that the kingdom's war funding is currently far below expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's worse is that the price of strategic materials in the international market has soared, and all countries have suffered from it, and there is no cheap material to sell to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no external hope, we can only tap the internal war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The governors present know best how well you have completed the task of raising strategic materials assigned by the Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the reality of the kingdom, Marshal Hudson's plan is the only way to solve the problem. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado spoke in support.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is difficult to be the Minister of Finance of a poor country, especially for a poor country like the Alpha Kingdom that is under the threat of war all the year round, it is even more difficult to be the Minister of Finance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Finance of the Kingdom is either raising money, or on the way to raising money. The matter of tearing down the east wall to make up for the west wall was all used during the orc invasion period.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The hole left by the last war has not been filled, and a new round of war has begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current Alpha Kingdom essentially no longer possesses the ability of extreme mobilization. In order to ensure the supply of front-line logistics materials, sufficient production personnel must be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson engaged in elite soldier training when he was in charge. It seems that \"the best soldiers are the most valuable\", but he was actually forced out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom doesn't have enough cannon fodder, which can be consumed continuously, so it can only improve the combat effectiveness of the soldiers and supplement the quantity with quality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it hit everyone's pain point, and everyone who was about to object chose to shut up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you have a chance to gamble, go for it! Taking advantage of the bargaining chips in hand, he can still fight for the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you wait until the middle and late stages of the war and passively enter the huge pit of two-front combat, I am afraid that you will have no chance to gamble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Give up allies for strategic materials, and there is no pressure on everyone. If certain provinces of the kingdom were to be abandoned for strategic reasons, the local aristocratic lords would have to explode on the spot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the speed of soldiers is very important on the battlefield. If you want to severely damage the coalition forces of the ancient survivors in a short period of time, the infantry may not be able to do it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Archbishop Effiero asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not difficult to mobilize 50,000 elite cavalry from the Alpha Kingdom, but it is different to mobilize 50,000 elite cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The total number of cavalry in the standing army is less than 40,000, and the number of cavalry that can be called elite is at most 20,000, so the rest can only be contributed by the nobles and lords of various places.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Grand Duke guessed right. The only cavalry that can be used in this military operation. Not only the knights in everyone's hands, but all of them will be requisitioned this time, even your monster cavalry must be requisitioned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the beast mount is immature, then find a way to force it to ripen. If there is a shortage of magic potions, I still have a lot left in my hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, all the monster cubs in the Mountain Territory have been ripened. The potion used is the exclusive potion for the descendants of the dragon that I made. The side effects are much smaller than ordinary ripening potions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The combat power and fertility of the ripened Warcraft cubs are not affected, but the size cannot keep up with the normal adult Warcraft.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, according to my observation, these forcibly ripened monsters are also growing in size, and may grow to the level of normal adult monsters in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will take time to verify the specifics. Anyway, judging from the current situation, except for the slightly affected lifespan and growth potential of the monster, the side effects are almost negligible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War does not affect business. In order to meet everyone's needs, Hudson also specially purchased a batch of the cheapest ripening potions from the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After diluting it by one to ten, Hudson added some dragon and bear urine and feces into it, and then poured some energy into it, and the takeaway version of the ripening potion was released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pharmaceuticals with few side effects and good effects, the price is naturally impossible to be low, and it directly surpassed all the ripening potions on the market as soon as it was born.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of unproven high-priced goods is naturally not popular in the market. After all, in the field of alchemy, Hudson is still a rookie and has no reputation at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Commodities that cost a lot of money, naturally can't be dropped in your hands. This battle is undoubtedly the best opportunity to build brand awareness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The modified version of the potion has been sold, and there is no fear of someone pushing back the ingredients. The urine and feces of dragons and bears are not so easy to get.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to experiment with piracy, you have to get the raw materials first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether this kind of collocation that does not conform to the principle of magic potion will make the alchemist's mentality collapse is none of Hudson's business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is estimated that after this transaction, Master Hudson's name as an alchemist will also resound throughout the continent. In the future, by selling magic potions, you can also become rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, are you sure that the side effects of the ripening potion only slightly affect the lifespan and development potential of Warcraft?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero couldn't help asking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic ripening potion with low side effects is not just a potion, but a strategic material that can change the pattern of the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the lifespan and development potential of Warcraft, it is not in the noble lord's consideration. As long as the training can be completed quickly, it is enough to invest in the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, I never lie! The most important reason why these medicines are so effective is because the raw materials are precious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, similar low-side effect ripening agents have also appeared on the mainland. Only limited by cost and output, it is impossible to carry out a large number of promotions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are interested, you can go to the Arcane Academy, where there are all kinds of weird research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ripening Warcraft cubs is just one of the common subjects. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson put out a wave of advertisements for the Arcane Academy without changing his face. There are indeed many research subjects, but they are limited to research.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many projects are limited by funds, and they are all over after the project is established, waiting for the big money to come to the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the outbreak of the Continental War, everyone knows that the kingdom has no money. I'm afraid those old fellows who are keen on research would have come out to solicit sponsors long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the honorary dean of the Arcane Academy, although Hudson can't afford to invest in so much research with an uncertain future, Hudson can't do nothing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First set the stage well, so that everyone will mistakenly think that his high-efficiency magic potion has something to do with the Arcane Academy. After the war is over, there will always be people who are taken advantage of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson knows very well how ruthless those people are in R&amp;D. Once infatuated, even one's own people can be cheated for funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less than half a year after the start of school, the college's one-year budget was bald by them. In order to maintain the operation of the college, the students had to amortize the tuition again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to cause trouble in the future, the kingdom's financial appropriation has been changed from annual allocation to monthly distribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sorry, Marshal. I was too presumptuous just now!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Hero hurriedly explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the addition of a master alchemist, Hudson's weight is even heavier, especially a master alchemist with unique skills cannot be easily offended.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raw materials are precious, but Hudson can achieve mass production. He is very clear about what this means.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a conflict of interest between the Northland aristocratic group and Hudson, which does not mean that Hero and Hudson will never die. Disputes in the aristocratic world are never black and white.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's understandable, this is something in the alchemy circle, and it's normal that His Excellency the Duke doesn't know about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are not at ease, you can take some back and try it out. But the speed needs to be faster, and the dose in my hand may not be able to meet everyone's needs. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a businessman, how can we care about customers' doubts?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the price issue, everyone tacitly did not mention it. The hint of \"precious medicinal materials\" is too obvious, and the price will definitely not be cheap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you are bargaining, this is not a suitable occasion.

Even if the proportion of young and strong men among the immigrants is low, the data is a considerable fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, it is said that the Holy See's fleet is about to enter the southeast coast, and the sea may not be peaceful for some time to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the safety of the fleet and to be responsible to customers, we need to wait and see the situation in the next few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the transportation task, you can choose to postpone it, or you can choose to terminate the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Liquidated damages can be deducted from the subsequent payment for this shipment. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captain Gul said with a painful expression on his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The return of the transportation mission in the Mountain Territory is not rich. The main purpose of taking over this mission is to hang the banner of Lord Hudson, to be able to pass unimpeded in the waters of the Alpha Kingdom, and no one who is not good-looking will come to make things difficult.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it doesn't make much money to transport refugees, but when they go to Newport, they are empty. At the moment, there is a shortage of all kinds of strategic materials on the prairie, and you can get a good return if you bring some goods there.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One transportation task, earn two waves of profits, and the rhythm of blood earning is properly established.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the plan did not change quickly, and the fleet of the Holy See went north. If you want to live long at sea, your eyes must be bright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dispute between the Alpha Kingdom and the Holy See is not something that little people like them can get involved in. If it is accidentally involved, there will be no residue left that will only be swallowed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, Jose nodded and said, \"Then postpone it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Liquidated damages are fine. The Holy See fleet going north is beyond your control. Wait until the situation stabilizes before continuing to perform the contract. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cooperation will not happen only once, and things cannot be done absolutely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maritime transportation seems to be huge profits, but in fact the risks are equal. If you are not lucky, you will still lose everything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet under the command of the great nobles is not bad, there is a lot less exploitation along the way, the safety is also more guaranteed, and the profits are indeed very rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grassroots fleets like Guer add blood to the knife edge every day. Most of the huge profits obtained were used to manage relationships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Being unable to go to sea for a period of time is a great pressure on the fleet. After all, the maintenance cost of the fleet and the cost of daily relationship management are indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the matter was provoked by the lord of the family, and the others were passively affected by the disaster without any reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Thank you, Mr. Jose, for your understanding. Please rest assured. When the situation stabilizes, the fleet will complete the mission as soon as possible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captain Gull hastily assured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nobleman's business is not easy to do, especially when he meets a powerful nobleman and insists on forcing the contract to be fulfilled, he can only take the risk of taking the fleet to sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even liquidated damages are waived, this is proper care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You are welcome, Captain Gul. I need to report this matter to the Earl, so I won't keep you.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said politely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not easy to be a housekeeper, there are a lot of trivial things. In particular, the influx of a large number of refugees has intensified the administrative pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original population of the Mountain Territory was only 340,000. In recent days, nearly 70,000 refugees have been imported, and the population has increased by more than 20%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suspending the import of refugees can also breathe a sigh of relief to the bureaucratic system of the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, Hudson had the foresight, and before the outbreak of the Continental War, he began to store grain on a large scale. When the war broke out, they took advantage of the lack of reaction from all parties to sweep up goods on the market.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, no matter how hard we try, we are still far from the ultimate goal of one million tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As of now, the total grain reserves in the territory are only 670,000 tons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the number is not small, but the people, horses and livestock in the territory will be consumed!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If a million immigrants flooded in at once, the inventory would be exhausted in a year or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the territory is also producing blood by itself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the current total grain output of the mountainous area, it is no problem to supply the consumption of 410,000 people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything went as expected, in the next few days, we received notices of suspension of transportation from various shipowners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See fleet is still on the way, and it has already had a major impact on the development of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The provinces along the southeast coast were also in trouble. Almost overnight, maritime trade was on the verge of extinction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Determining people's wealth, such as killing parents. Even if it is the mighty Vatican, everyone cannot tolerate it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driven by common interests, a large net against the Holy See fleet has quietly spread along the coast of the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, after receiving the news from the territory, Hudson couldn't help but greet the senior officials of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current immigration activities are underground in nature, and they are not visible at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the kingdom and the steppe countries complete the negotiations and the immigration activities are on the surface, then all the forces in the kingdom will share the cake together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even big aristocrats with enough population will come in to get a share of the pie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, war is full of uncertainties. What if an enclave is obtained after the war?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really useless, and it can be resold, and it will definitely not lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has calculated that among the millions of people on the grassland, half of them can escape because of the blessing of the Lord of Dawn. If they are unlucky, the survivors may not even be a third.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still based on the cooperation of all countries, otherwise the number of people who can escape will be even smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many nobles in the country shared the spoils together, and it was estimated that it was only a few hundred thousand in his hands. If you work hard, it will cost two hundred thousand at most.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How can such a small population satisfy Hudson's appetite?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the formal channels are not working, then you can only do small tricks in private. This is the advantage of being a coastal aristocrat. If you are an inland aristocrat, you can't use it even if you have connections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar things are also happening in northern Xinjiang. Some border noble lords with vast land and sparsely populated areas also brandished hoes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just everyone's way, not as wild as Hudson, who directly pulls people by boat by boat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, Hudson has been very restrained. The hired fleets are all inconspicuous. If the fleets of the coastal nobles are hired together, the harvest will definitely be much greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the benefits are great, and the disputes caused are also great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the negotiations are not yet over. At present, the refugees in the grassland countries are still ownerless, and whoever grabs them will return to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the whole kingdom regards these people as their pockets, and eating too ugly can easily cause public anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if everyone doesn't have the time to get angry now, they will definitely remember it in their hearts, and sooner or later they will pay the price for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Hudson quickly thought of an idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cake is not enough, so find a way to make it bigger. How can there be no refugees when the continental war has spread so widely?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Less aside, the number of refugees who flooded into the Moxi Principality from the Warhammer Kingdom alone was probably in the millions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the flames of war continue to expand, refugees from a series of countries such as the Principality of Kantruo, the Principality of Ustad, the Principality of Fick, and the Principality of Orton may flood into the Principality of Mosi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to keep people, you must at least solve the problem of eating for everyone. The principality of Moxi, which is about to be burned to the door of the house, is obviously unable to accommodate so many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It just so happens that the next military operation is to support the Principality of Moxi, and no one will buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all labor forces, no matter where they come from, Hudson doesn't pick them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recruiting people from the Principality of Moxi has no other disadvantages except that the distance is a little longer and the cost of immigration is a little higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the war starts, ten thousand taels of gold.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, Hudson made a fortune selling arms; this time the war was even more severe, and the magic potion was out of the circle before the battle started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have to admit that huge profits still depend on extraordinary strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no deliberate rip-off, just pricing based on current market laws.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To ripen a low-level monster cub, the magic potion that needs to be purchased is between 800 gold coins and 3,000 gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It mainly depends on the situation of the monsters. The energy required for the growth of the first-tier monsters and the third-tier monsters is different, and the cost is naturally different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the little nobles, such a cost must be a sky-high price. Everyone would rather wait for more than ten or twenty years for the magical beast to mature naturally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the great nobles, some expenses are not worth mentioning at all. Compared with the cost of medicine, everyone is more worried about the fact that there are not enough magical beast cubs in their hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of the training in the early stage, the current actual magic potion expenditure is slightly smaller.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A family has a total of one hundred and eighty monster cubs, and the total cost is only a few hundred thousand gold coins. Even the poorest nobleman would not be unable to afford this little money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The small and medium-sized nobles are not that rich financially, but they also have a small number of Warcraft cubs in their hands. Some families even have only one head, and they gritted their teeth and passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A single family is nothing, but when all the nobles in the kingdom add up, it is an astronomical order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to this, the Kingdom's military is also a major customer. There are more than 800 Yalong beasts alone, and a group of underage griffins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to preliminary estimates, the final order amount will not be less than 5 million gold coins. If the business scope is expanded to the entire North Continent, it will only be a matter of time before it doubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for drug cost control, this is Master Hudson's strong point. The potion is originally a deceptive drug, so naturally it cannot be expensive, and the biggest cost is energy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, they own shares in the Magic Crystal Mine, and the industrial chain has formed a closed loop, so there must be a 93% gross profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all normal operation. The magic potion industry is a profiteering industry, and all the excess profits are paid for research and development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the era of purely handmade, cheap potions do not exist. Even if it is the cheapest medicine, it must at least have a 50/50 profit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is still a unified wholesale price. If there are a few transfers in the middle, the final retail price will be even higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, the Grand Duke of Efiero, and the Marquis of Delgado are visiting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the guard said, Hudson knew that business was coming.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prime minister, the minister of military affairs, and the minister of finance came here together. Apart from talking about the price, you can't talk about romance, right?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"please!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's funny to say that Hudson has never been to the Fengyue place after being a nobleman for so many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The legendary aristocrat lived a life of luxury and gold, and never enjoyed it. Instead, he was often accompanied by gold and iron horses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps after the war is over, we should find an opportunity to see it, otherwise we will lose a lot of topics to brag about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, how many potions do you have in your hand? The kingdom wants them all!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to the words of the prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, Hudson almost spit out the tea in his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What gave them the illusion that they took it for granted that the Kingdom had the power to swallow all the potions in his hands?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If Wang Guo dared to sweep the goods, he would be ready to go bankrupt tomorrow!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson could whip up a hundred versions of Ripening Potion in a day if he wanted to. Composition or non-composition are minor issues, the key is to be able to work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to take it back to analyze the ingredients, the samples given in the early stage are enough, and all the medicines in the future will go into the belly of the monster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, most magic potions have leak-proof devices. Once the bottle is opened, it must be used immediately, otherwise qualitative changes will occur soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson didn't play that way, the main reason was to make sure that someone else had reversed the formula, and the potion would not be produced by piracy, so there was no need to increase production costs for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, I have made an agreement with everyone, we must not break the agreement!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the kingdom needs it, it can take fifteen thousand doses first. The price is as agreed in advance, 500 gold coins per dose. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson's voice fell to the ground, the faces of the three were really pretty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The one who is close to the water is the first to get the moon, and the monster is right in front of him. Naturally, he completed the drug test first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only does Yalong Beast have remarkable effects after taking it, but even other Warcraft cubs have amazing effects after taking it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I originally thought that the output of this kind of magic potion with low side effects should be very small. In order to seize the opportunity, the Kingdom naturally had to act first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who would know that Hudson's unit of measurement is ten thousand?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He kept saying that a lot of precious medicinal materials were used, but where is it so precious?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that this statement cannot be miscalculated. Judging from the composition of the medicine analyzed, there is an unknown medicinal material.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to several magic potion masters, some are like the feces and urine of giant dragons, and some are like the urine and feces of earth bears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the ingredients are similar, there is no real thing for comparison, and everyone doesn't know what is added to the medicine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, it is a magical world, not suitable for scientific analysis. Many medicinal materials with exactly the same ingredients have completely opposite effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The formula, method, temperature when refining the medicine may affect the efficacy of the medicine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The medicine provided by Hudson is a mess, and everyone can't understand the principle at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the continent of Aslante, things that cannot be understood are not necessarily awesome, but things that have extraordinary effects and cannot be understood are definitely awesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rare things are more expensive. If the output is very low, the kingdom will naturally sweep the goods directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the production units of medicines use tens of thousands, which obviously has nothing to do with the scarcity. Fifteen thousand doses, that is 7.5 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alpha Kingdom, which is in financial difficulties, it is obviously a kind of pressure to withdraw so much funds at once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, you don't need that much. The kingdom purchases 3,500 doses, the royal family purchases 2,000 doses, and 5,500 doses are enough.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, said a little embarrassedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was a big joke, but there is no way, the overall budget is so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of magical beast cubs in the hands is limited, and even these medicines may not be used up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, these ripening potions are for junior monster cubs, and the demand for a monster is not very high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I'll arrange for Maxim to deliver the goods right away, and you can come and pick them up tomorrow.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as you don't bargain, we are good friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if he really can't win the favor, he will give a few more appropriately, but the price must not be lowered, this is a matter of principle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, if the production of medicines is high, we can use these medicines to help the countries of the North Continent threatened by alien races. Do you think it is feasible?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, we don't fund everyone. If you have a problem with someone, you can list the other party as a prohibited object. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be said that he is worthy of being the Minister of Finance, and he can see business opportunities. In name, it is to help, but in fact, it is to take advantage of the opportunity to make a fortune.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The World of Warcraft Legion project a few years ago was participated by all countries in the North Continent. At present, there are a group of Warcraft cubs waiting to be fed in the hands of various countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it can be directly ripened to adulthood, it will greatly improve the military strength of the Northern Continent. Even if the price is a little higher, all countries can only grit their teeth and accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Hudson's ability, he can naturally spread the potion, but it will take a lot of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe the drug has not been promoted in the past, and some countries have already disappeared in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the power of the Kingdom is used, this process will undoubtedly be greatly accelerated. The most important thing is that the wholesale price has not been affected, and Marquis Delgado has not given him a discount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If you can help the countries of the Northern Continent and contribute to the great cause of the human race's resistance to alien races, every noble in the kingdom is bound to do so!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said with a holy face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is always willing to help others when it does not affect his own interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal is a noble character, he is really a model for our human race...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the extra quota of ripening agents, our Ministry of Finance has demanded all of them, and the deposit will be delivered tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Follow-up payment, after the medicine is sold out, we will send it over immediately. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous words were very positive, but the situation changed later, and the Ministry of Finance was unable to pay in full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson has no mind, it's that there are many things that cannot set precedents. The Ministry of Finance plays on credit, what should relatives and old friends follow suit?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the war, everyone was short of money. Even if there is no shortage of money for the time being, I want to keep some cash in my pocket to meet unexpected needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, it's okay to have a little debt outside. But the current situation is special, and the debtor may be gone in the blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, it is also the best debt-raising period. If you are lucky, the creditor may suddenly disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Marquis Delgado, in order to refine this batch of potions, the mountain leaders have been hollowed out, and they owed a large amount of debt outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now I urgently need to withdraw funds to repay the debts I owed earlier, so the payment must have a clear deadline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Ministry of Finance is not tight on hand, you can get a small amount of goods first. Anyway, the price I gave to the kingdom is already the most favorable price, no one can lower it...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sold out immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha Kingdom's anti-risk ability is good, but no one can guarantee that the Ministry of Finance's anti-risk ability is also strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The batch of bonds in his hand made him unable to sleep. If he added a few million more debts, he would have no way to live.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on Hudson's understanding of Caesar IV, when the kingdom's finances collapsed, he could really do bad things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are restrictions on the relationship between the monarch and his ministers. If he really gets to that point, he can only hold his nose and admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The property rights of the Mountain Territory are unclear. Except for the registered fiefdoms, most of the land in Hudson belongs to black households and does not need to pay taxes to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a tacit agreement between the kingdom and the noble lords. In order to encourage everyone to expand, the newly expanded land will not be included in the taxation area until the development is completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When will be taxed later, it depends on whether the monarch is strong or not. Based on the current performance of Caesar IV, it is estimated that Hudson will not need to pay taxes on this part of the newly added land in his life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tax area is small, and the financial revenue contributed to the kingdom is limited. It would be too much for him to take the lead in resisting taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if you fight hard with the king and forcibly take the tax deduction from the territory, I am afraid that you will not be able to fill in the interest on the funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, otherwise, the medicine will be in your hands first, but the quota must be reserved for our Ministry of Finance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the deal is reached, send someone directly to pick up the goods in your hands, and then the money and goods will be settled. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marquis Delgado thought for a while and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible not to make a reservation in advance. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finds out, they will come to grab the business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the relationship with other countries, they are professionals. At that time, when the two sides are connected, there will be nothing to do with the Ministry of Finance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Grand Duke Afiero on the side also became eager to try. The Alpha Kingdom is poor, and the small coffers of the kingdom's ministries are naturally not rich.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an opportunity to make money, no one will miss it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Ministry of Military Affairs is in a special situation, and the Ministry of Finance supports them very strongly. The Grand Duke Afiero, who lost his chance, is embarrassed to dismantle the funder's platform.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

In the end, although it ended in failure, the epic retreat of the Holy See was completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Alpha people didn't even have a symbolic interception. It seems that the death of Caesar III also took away their courage.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fourth Fleet Commander Harmodi said mockingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't keep your own sphere of influence, you won't be able to gain everyone's respect. Especially the current practice of ignoring and letting them in is a sign of weakness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    International struggles are very delicate. The weaker you are, the easier it is to expose your own reality, and the more the opponent will push forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hammoudi, don't take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alphas succumb so easily, there is no need for us to go north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't you see someone coming? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Moses finished speaking, a ship flying the flag of the Alpha Kingdom appeared in the distance and was slowly approaching them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hello, three commanders, on behalf of the Alpha Kingdom, I welcome you all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is a sea map of the misty ocean. I hope that the three of you can lead the army to quell the disaster of the ghost ship as soon as possible, and restore peace to the sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soldiers are expensive and fast on the battlefield, so I will disturb the three of you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, the envoy turned and left directly, as if sending off the plague god.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammodi was furious, but he was held back by the two people beside him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two countries did not kill the envoys when they were at war. Now that they have not yet entered a state of war, how can they attack the envoys.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not three hundred years ago now, and the Holy See cannot casually label someone a heretic and then send them to the grill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing nobles from various countries, the Holy See also has to abide by new rules of the game.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you pulling me for? This person is so arrogant, don't give him some strength...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, Moses, the commander of the First Fleet, interrupted: \"That's enough, Harmodi, why are you still so impulsive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the relationship between us and the Alpha Kingdom, is it possible that you still expect the other party to welcome you sincerely?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you moved your hand just now, the other party would dare to show you. After the Human Race Alliance pursues it, the people above may not protect you to death! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The commander of the fleet is not a high position in the Holy See, and none of the high-level Holy See on the holy mountain is from the navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by tradition. Before the development of the navy, the upper position was carved up, and as a latecomer, it is natural not to rush in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The action of this labor expedition, in the eyes of Moses, is an opportunity to prove the value of the navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is absolutely unacceptable to ruin the navy's plan for a small matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Moses, it's not that I'm looking for trouble, the main reason is that the other party is bullying too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What are we going to do, how can we listen to outsiders?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send a set of nautical charts here. Could it be that we don't even know the information on the Misty Sea and need them to help? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammodi couldn't help complaining.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The impulsiveness of his performance does not mean that he is really an idiot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Holy See is a relational society, it also needs to test ability. If he was a good-for-nothing idiot, he wouldn't be able to get the position of fleet commander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The performance just now seemed reckless, so why is it not necessary for human design?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only for the alpha people to see, but also for the boss of the family, and it is politically correct to maintain the dignity of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really want to make a move, how can you be held back by your companions at such a short distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's so strange, it's nothing more than wanting to use our hands to get rid of the ghost ship lurking in the sea of ​​mist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from the Holy Mountain, the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom's battle line is on the verge of collapse, and the Alpha people's attention has probably been attracted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, I am afraid that the coastal areas will not be taken care of.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is nothing we can do on the bright side, so naturally we have to play in the dark. The sea of ​​mist is known as the ten most dangerous places in the mainland, and the ships entering it can't be said to be close to death, at least seven or eight out of ten will be damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now there are still ghost ships hiding in it, and the danger is even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha people clearly want to borrow a knife to kill people, now it depends on whether the knife they borrowed is sharp enough. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moses sneered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows the dangerous continent of the Sea of ​​Mists, but they have reasons to enter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This operation was originally under the banner of encircling and suppressing the ghost ship. If there is no actual action at all, the face of the Holy See will not be good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing is the news of the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The treasure hunting team disappeared in the misty sea area, suspected to be the black hand of the Alpha people, but the issue of the artifact has not yet been settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the Alphas were the black hands before the treasure hunting team entered the Duron Island, or the black hands after returning, or the treasure hunting team had an accident during the search for the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These uncertain issues must be clarified by the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, one day, an inheritance artifact will suddenly appear from the outside world, and it will be a tragedy to announce the establishment of a separate Holy See as a legal order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glanced at the chart and found that it was the most widely circulated version in the mainland, Moses shook his head secretly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alpha's performance is too stingy, if you want to borrow a knife to kill people, you have to give me a detailed version of the sea chart!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, considering the particularity of the foggy sea area, it seems that an approximate location is enough. Anyway, no matter where you enter from, it will be a cloud of fog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sun doesn't shine in, and you can't tell the difference between day and night. There is only a poisonous dragon island inside, and it doesn't seem to make any difference whether there is a chart inside or not.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the guidance of the guide, the fleet moved forward slowly, leaving enough energy to deal with the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Obviously, this is a distrust of the Alpha Kingdom, and they are always vigilant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disdain on the lips was just for the soldiers. The high-level commanders are not stupid and really don't care about the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the royal capital, Marshal Hudson, who is paying close attention to military affairs, is about to ask King Caesar IV for leave again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar leave of absence occurs several times a month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson wants to fish, it's that the current working system of the Alpha Kingdom is too anti-human.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The system of one day off every ten days makes it really difficult for a family like Master Hudson to live far away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a good man who takes care of his family, Hudson strictly implemented the system of five days off and five days off after the army training became regular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasional delays are inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the affairs of the kingdom have to be dealt with, and the affairs of the territory also need to be taken care of by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the advantage of the dragon knight. If other nobles travel back and forth between the two places so frequently, they will exhaust the monsters to death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, just received news that the Holy See fleet has entered the kingdom's waters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what the guard said, Hudson knew it was time to start again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom wants to attack the Holy See fleet, how can it miss him as the coach?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson boasted. Without him, even if the Holy See fleet suffered heavy losses, the great nobles in the coastal provinces might not really dare to make trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is determined by the age of those in power. It seems that the governors of all provinces are in the prime of life, but in fact many of them are pregnant with great-grandchildren.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Pierce, who is over fifty years old, is considered to be in the prime of life among the leaders of the major families.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The average life expectancy is short, so what does that have to do with those in power?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the children of the great aristocrats have decent talents, and there are no accidents in the middle, they can easily live to be a hundred or eighty years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normal power changes are often after the heir's temper has been ground into a veteran in the political arena, usually after the age of 40 or 50.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shou Jiangshan's age is the best, and all his abilities and prestige have been tempered. Neither will he fall into twilight due to lack of energy, nor will he act impulsively when he is young.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send this document to the palace.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The training is on the right track, and he, the marshal, doesn't have much to do. Except for the occasional spot check on the training situation, the rest of the time is spent fishing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the officers below, the current training is not only about training, but also about their fame, fortune and life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, Hudson was still supervising carefully. Later, when it was discovered that he was there, everyone trained very hard, so they simply didn't care about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With little military affairs, asking the king for leave is naturally going through the motions, proving that he respects the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether Caesar IV approves it, anyway, Hudson will leave the royal capital before the letter arrives at the palace, and it will be too late to chase him back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is the Sea of ​​Mist, and it is just as it is in the legend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no expert to accompany it, once an ordinary ship goes deep into it, it may be really difficult to find its way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The area of ​​the misty sea is not small. Whether it is searching for ghost ships or searching for Dulong Island, it cannot be completed in a day or two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inside was shrouded in fog, and many of the weapons and equipment on board were useless. Ordinary soldiers might not be able to help if they followed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This battle is not easy to fight! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammodi frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic crystal cannon is useless, and ordinary soldiers fighting ghosts are purely killing people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the fleet suffers heavy losses due to the encirclement and suppression of the ghost ship, they will not be able to explain it when they go back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"If the battle is easy to fight, it will not be our turn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are quite a few people who are concerned about the core of the ghost ship. The Alpha people have assembled a fleet along the coast, but in the end they chose to give up when things came to an end. One can imagine the danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The armament on board is unusable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, after entering the sea of ​​mist, there is not much difference between a warship and an ordinary merchant ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that we can only leave the fleet outside and send experts to search for traces of the ghost ship. Only after solving these guys can we rest assured to look for Poison Dragon Island. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moses said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leaving the fleet outside is also full of risks. In case the Alphas attack them, when the troops are divided, it is the best time for the opponent to make a move.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the combined three major fleets are stronger than the entire naval power of the Alpha Kingdom, it is not only the fleet that affects the outcome of the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering more eighth-level masters, or mobilizing air power, can help in the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send a few ships over, light the ghost lamp to test it, and try to lure the ghost ship first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case these guys are drawn out, the next battle will be less worrying. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Commander of the Second Fleet on the side suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"good!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several worthless supply ships were honored to take over this cannon fodder mission, slowly wandering around the edge of the fog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This scene happened to be captured by Hudson who flew from the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such poor acting skills, I also want to lure out my own ghost ship, so I am not afraid of wasting time and losing troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the mocking expression was revealed, reality began to hit his face, and Hudson clearly sensed that the ghost ship was approaching here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Spiritual Lamp!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recognizing the origin of the mysterious black smoke, Hudson's face changed drastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This thing is not a good product.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to ancient records, the spirit lamp is a sacred object of a cult in ancient times. Once lit, it is very attractive to the soul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more souls devoured, the more powerful the lamp will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because the production process is too cumbersome and the use is too vicious, it has long since disappeared in the long river of history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How it is made, Hudson does not know, anyway, the fuel is corpse oil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See took out all these things, no wonder it dared to announce to the outside world that it would definitely be able to destroy the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the slightest hesitation, one person, one dragon and one bear landed directly on the deck of the ghost ship, and the three ghost kings rushed out to greet them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have met the Lord! I don't know...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the leader, the ghost king, could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Stop advancing immediately, and turn to enter Poison Dragon Island to collect poison!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Island is full of poisonous insects, a proper place where no strangers should enter, but ghosts are obviously not included.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless it is a toxin that acts on the soul, it has no effect on these spiritual bodies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"yes!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that the three ghost kings are very conscious of being slaves. Although they don't know why, they still accepted the task honestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outskirts of the sea of ​​mist, the smoke from the burning spirit lamp made everyone on board feel ecstatic, but there was still no shadow of the ghost ship, and the faces of the three fleet commanders also turned ugly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Perhaps the ghost ship is too far away to sense the situation here, so send someone to extinguish the spirit lamp!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That thing is too evil, if it continues to burn, there may be no living people on the ships that were sent out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammodi said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An evil weapon is an evil weapon after all, even an evil weapon that targets spirit bodies like a spirit lamp can have a great influence on ordinary people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just such a short time, the soldiers on board lost their minds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's lucky, if the ghost ship really comes, I'm afraid none of them will survive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Treatment is not enough, then divide the troops directly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our strength has not been compromised, and the Alpha people should not dare to act rashly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the ghost lamp, even if the ghost ship came out from behind, it would not be able to threaten the fleet. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Moses said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no proposal to let the masters who hunt ghost ships carry ghost lamps. It's not because the things are not easy to use, but because the side effects are too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Losing consciousness is one aspect. The key is that after absorbing the smoke from the spirit lamp, it will seriously affect the longevity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he dared to issue such an order, the masters on board the ship would probably turn against him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the clouds, Maxim eagerly proposed: \"Hudson, do you want me to cast a forbidden spell on them to destroy the evil weapon below?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this proposal, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. Playing like this is not a sneak attack, it is clearly a direct declaration of war on the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the entire continent of Aslant, Maxim, a red dragon, is active outside. If you want to find the dragon's blame, you can't find it. The dragon knight is responsible for the trouble caused by the dragon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Started a war with the Holy See head-on, Hudson said that he is not crazy yet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What's the rush, wait until the ghosts collect enough poison, and then settle the score with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Isn't it just a spirit lamp, so they have to have time to light it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, here is the sea, and the wind and waves doused out the lights, which is also very reasonable! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patience, Hudson is the most indispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See and his party do not divide their troops, he can only let the ghost ship hang around in the sea of ​​mist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it is different now. A large number of masters have left the fleet, and the rest are ordinary naval officers and soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having personally verified the strength of the ghost ship, Hudson knows very well that these people cannot destroy the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the hull is not destroyed, ghosts can be killed at will, and they can be resurrected anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers and soldiers of the Holy See are different. If they die, they are really dead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People died at the hands of ghosts, no matter how heavy the loss was, the Holy See had no choice but to admit it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without this fleet, the group of Holy See masters after entering the mist will become meat on the chopping board.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you can't beat those masters, as long as you destroy their ship, you can fly back to the mainland by yourself if you have the ability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stupid dragon, it has to be night to do evil!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The black light is blind, you go to the sea to take a bath, the wind and waves you raise can capsize the boat. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beside Bear Stearns decisively made up for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dark seabed has changed a little bit, and it is impossible to see clearly. All kinds of accidents can happen in the vast sea, and it is nothing new for a sea monster to emerge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how rich the associations of the Holy See are, it is difficult to directly pin the suspicion on Maxim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is evidence of alibi. All the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom can prove that Master Hudson held a meeting in the palace with his mount.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weather on the sea changes as soon as it is said, and when the night is about to fall, the storm sweeps in first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolling waves kept beating the ship, as if trying to swallow the fleet staying on the sea. The left-behind fleet commander, Moxis, showed his due qualities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order and immediately activate the defensive magic circle!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Keep distance between adjacent warships to prevent collisions...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the distance, the three ghost ships that returned with a full load slowly sailed out of the misty sea after avoiding the search team of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just stop here, don't go up to fight the enemy, you can fly!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the ghosts throw the poisonous insects they collected onto these warships respectively. Remember to be quiet and try not to be discovered by others. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson sternly warned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, my lord!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the depressed expressions of the ghosts, it can be seen how much they resisted this order, but there were three ghost kings pressing down on them, so they had to carry out the order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, he really doesn't understand why the ghost ship chooses to fight on board every time it comes out to rob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stay away from the enemy's firepower and directly let the \"Apiaos\" go to sneak attack How perfect!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the number of ghost ships is small. It is purely that these guys have the attribute of death in their bones. They have been dead for many years and insist on thinking that they are still alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't control other ghost ships, anyway, the ghosts on his own ship can't be so stupid.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

At this time, they were attacked by ghosts, and it was difficult to take care of all the warships at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are also these poisonous insects that popped up suddenly, obviously someone is manipulating them behind the scenes, otherwise how could the ghosts have so many thoughts? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The deputy's reminder shocked Moses. Then he said angrily:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn Alpha people, dare to collude with ghosts. I will definitely report this matter to the Governor of the Holy See and give them a good look!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to let the people of the Inquisition to light the lamp. The sea is stormy, put it in the cabin...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the words were finished, a warship sank in front of Moses. The backflow of sea water caused waves, which also affected nearby ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Revenge on the Alpha Kingdom, don't think about it for now. How to get through this catastrophe is the crux of the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flagship was safe and sound. It was because Hudson knew that there were still experts left to protect the commander, and deliberately let the ghosts avoid this tough bone first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the warships are in distress. The poisonous insects that ravage the cabin, together with the elusive ghosts, and the storm to help out, the battle is impossible to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless soldiers received orders from the commander, but they didn't even know where the enemy was. Under the influence of panic, some soldiers with fragile hearts collapsed directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Either throwing down their weapons and running around on the boat, or picking up the weapons in their hands and leaving them on the boat to slash wildly, without caring about carrying out orders at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, even if such evil things as \"Lamps of Spirits\" are not activated, they will affect the lifespan if they are in contact for a long time. The big shots are very taboo about this thing, so naturally they will not bring it into the flagship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, if it were really placed in the flagship, Moxis would not give such an order that almost died together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first warship sank, as if the valve had been opened, followed by warships one after another, sinking like dumplings, and finally swallowed by the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that the situation was not good, Moses ordered again in a panic: \"Let the magic crystal cannon fire, there are so many ghosts, they must have encountered a ghost ship!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All light magicians, immediately cast lighting spells and find out the location of the ghost ship for me...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The judgment is not wrong, creatures like ghosts are rare, especially in the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Occasionally encounter a few or it may be an accident, large-scale appearance, or encounter a ghost ship, or stray into some dangerous place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fleet has been standing still without moving, and suddenly encountered a large number of ghost attacks. It must have encountered a ghost ship that came to \"rob\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the way to deal with it is a bit embarrassing. The lighting techniques were released one by one, which was extraordinarily dazzling in the storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, after searching the sea for several miles, no trace of the ghost ship was found. The magic crystal cannon was fully loaded, but it was embarrassing to find that it couldn't find the target.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if the artillerymen were too nervous, or the tumbling waves caused the accident, a magic crystal cannon was suddenly fired. Immediately afterwards, all the magic crystal cannons kept ringing with \"rumbling\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally wanted to stop, but hesitated a little, Moses still gave up the idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the storm, even with the lighting technique, the distance that can be seen is very limited. In case the ghost ship hides out of sight, letting the magic crystal bombard it might be able to get a windfall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To wipe out the opponent, Moses no longer had extravagant hopes. As long as he can drive away the sneak attacking ghost ship, he is already very satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At worst, it would have to be delayed until dawn. The combat power of the ghosts at night was too great. If the battle took place during the day, they would never be so passive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the distance, Hudson, who witnessed the battle, showed a faint smile on the corner of his mouth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, the quality shown by the Holy See fleet after the attack can be regarded as excellent in the entire Aslant continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the sudden storm that provided cover for the sneak attack, it wouldn't be easy to succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fly in the ointment is this operation, there is no way to see the light. If the kingdom's fleet had been notified in advance, it might be possible to capture a few warships and bring them back as spoils of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, we can only wait for the sunken ship to be salvaged after the war. Whether it will be able to gain something is still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the misty sea area, the search and arrest team received the signal for help and hurried back. The more anxious you are, the easier it is to lose your way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the storm, the position of the warship is constantly moving. Going back the same way was just an extravagant hope. After turning the bow of the ship and running around in a daze, I soon lost my way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammodi, who was so angry that he led the team, cursed at the captain. I knew that this trip would not go well, but I didn't expect that the first accident would be the fleet that stayed outside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they had known that the ghost ship would attack the fleet, they would have been so busy, they would have just sat back and waited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Commander, the wind and waves at sea are too strong, and there are no marks nearby, so there is no way to lock the direction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Otherwise, send someone to investigate first, determine the location of the fleet, and then we will rush there. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the middle-aged captain finished speaking, he got a big mouth. It was obviously a good idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At other times, it is not a big problem to send experts out to search for the location of the fleet, but here is the sea of ​​fog.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is gray as far as the eye can see. If you really leave the warship, you may not even find your way back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hammodi, hurry up and find a way. There are too few masters left behind in the fleet, and you will definitely suffer a big loss if you encounter an eighth-order ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we go back late and the fleet suffers heavy losses, the Holy Mountain will not be able to explain it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ascetic old man said sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These dark cultivators have never been welcomed in the Holy See. Even if he became a powerhouse of the eighth rank, his status was not that high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way, talent and birth environment are innate, non-human can change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, these people are lucky. If it weren't for the fact that the Holy See was in decline and needed \"cult\" organizations to do dirty work, they wouldn't even be qualified to practice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three hundred years ago, when the Holy See dominated the mainland, anyone who detected the talent of darkness would be destroyed by humanity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the parents are rich and powerful, and they can't bear to watch their own flesh and blood being murdered, at most they can only hide their darkly gifted children among the people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a group of dark-type powerhouses, this operation is their best chance to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strong in the continent of Aslante are respected. As long as a dark sanctuary is born, their embarrassing situation in the Holy See will inevitably change.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Correspondingly, if the operation fails and the fleet suffers heavy losses, they are also the best people to blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of their faith, there are not many people in the Holy See who dislike them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Kicked the old man hard, and Harmodi said angrily: \"Enough! Didn't you see that I was trying to figure out a way, what a mess!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In terms of strength, he is indeed inferior to the old man in front of him, but he is a seventh-rank paladin and also serves as the commander of the fleet, so his status is actually higher than the old man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A few skirmishes are nothing, the key is how to find the location of the main fleet. He just took it for granted and went back the same way. He didn't know where he was now after a whirlwind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I have sent a message to Moses, asking him to make the magic crystal cannon sound and guide us in the direction. As long as we get closer, we can identify the direction based on the sound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is only the sound of the storm here, which proves that the fleet is not in this sea area, and continue to search in another direction! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Harmodi once wanted to order his troops to divide into three groups and search in the other three directions to increase the probability of encounter. It's just subconsciously telling him it's dangerous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This feeling has saved his life several times. The thrilling feeling appeared again, and Harmodi really didn't dare to take it lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The **** battle continued. The rain washed away the blood stains left on the ship, but it couldn't wash away the chilling atmosphere on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roaring cannon still continued, but it seemed a little weak. As warships sank one after another, the sound of artillery fire became weaker and weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching helplessly, the fleet in his hand was constantly being attacked, but he couldn't even find the enemy's direction. Moses couldn't sit still anymore.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a voice in his heart constantly reminding him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I can't continue to sit still!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You can't sit still!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't find the body of the ghost ship, killing more ghosts will be in vain. Take the ghost king in front of me as an example. It fell twice on the flagship, but it was still alive and kicking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength is indeed weakened compared to the original, but this weakening is too insignificant. On the contrary, the two eighth-rank powerhouses on the flagship were killed, which became a permanent loss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    People can die and come back to life, and they can bring a group of little ghosts to die together, but the strong man on the warship is really dead after death.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current battle situation, if the main body of the ghost ship cannot be found and the opponent is severely injured, the fleet will not last until dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knowing is one thing, how to get out of it is another. The entanglement in his heart directly affected his command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, it doesn't matter whether there is a commander or not in the battle until now. Anyway, the entire battlefield is in chaos, and the formation has long since ceased to exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by the waves, the magic crystal cannon accidentally injured its own warship, and it happened more than once. But they still dare not let the artillery fire stop. This is the last spiritual sustenance of the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the whole army will disperse and break through!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After struggling hard, Moses ordered helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A warship that can run is one, and staying in place will only be slowly worn to death by the enemy. The location of the ghost ship could not be found, and there was no way to launch a counterattack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is incompetent, it's that the enemy is too cunning. Whose ghost ship came out to rob, but the ghost did not see the ship?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The nearby officers wanted to persuade, but finally shut up again. After issuing this order, Moses will definitely be in bad luck when he is held accountable in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't disperse and break through, you won't be able to pass this level tonight, so how can you talk about the future?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the clouds, one person, one dragon and one bear watching the battle, are wearing a magic shield at the moment, constantly commenting on the battle below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he didn't have dinner, he was forgotten by Hudson. Meals can be eaten at any time, but this kind of exciting battle is not encountered every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not good, the enemy wants to run!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing warships keep getting out of position, Hudson immediately realized that something was wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Holy See has too many fleets. Even after several hours of fighting, there are still many warships on the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Staying in place to fight can also slowly consume the enemy and grind them to death in this sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, the enemies are fleeing in all directions. Even if Hudson goes off in person, it is impossible to leave all the enemies behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking for a while, Hudson immediately ordered: \"You give the ghost king an order, don't worry about those small warships, and leave the enemy's capital ships first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, you are flexible enough to secretly look for opportunities to help the ghosts, but remember not to reveal your identity. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not let Maxim take action. On the one hand, he needed the dragon to protect himself, and on the other hand, he was worried.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the technique of playing sap, Bear Stearns is a professional, but Maxim has just started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the toss is high, Hudson can't guarantee that his stupid dragon can control the dragon's ostentatious nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not sure to silence all the enemies. If my identity is exposed, it will be set on fire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom can indeed withstand thunder, but the premise is that the hatred cannot be drawn too deep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What if he really angered him and the Holy See took his lair when he led troops out?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the previous series of conflicts, Hudson did offend the Holy See, but it was not a life-and-death enmity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Initially robbed and killed the cavalry of the Holy See, that was ignorance, plus the execution of orders from superiors. The kingdom directly took over the firepower, and people couldn't think of him as a little baron.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"Blood Moon Horn\" will be traded later. Although there is suspicion of extortion, the evil weapon itself is worth the price.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the vest of the great magister of the undead. I'm afraid the Holy See still doesn't know whether he made the deal with the great magister of the undead, or with him, the lord.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the future conflict, there will only be a dispute of words. Hudson is the representative of the Alpha Kingdom, not a conflict between himself and the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time is different, the three main fleets of the Holy See are almost gone by him. Who can endure such an unforgettable hatred?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the rules of the game are established without touching the opponent's bottom line. This time, it's not just the bottom line, but even the bottom line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the three main fleets are all buried here, the Holy See's sea power will drop by at least 70%. Don't say it is like reaching out to the outside world now, it is difficult to maintain the safety of one's own sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be said unceremoniously that at least in the next five years, there will be no warships of the Holy See in the waters of the Kingdom of Alpha.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they want to take revenge on the kingdom, they cannot come by sea. The remaining sea power of the Holy See is no longer comparable to the sum of the sea power of all the kingdom's sea power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is for Hudson or for the nobles on the southeast coast, this is a great benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sea cannot come, but the power coming from the land can take revenge on a certain noble family alone. If it targets the entire kingdom, it is purely giving away the head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The countries along the way are not easy to use. If the Holy See dispatches too much force, it will not be able to hide them from the eyes of local snakes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is inconvenient to do black hands in person and spread the news to the Alpha Kingdom to sell favors, it is still possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, this battle has shaped the kingdom's maritime strategic security for the next five to ten years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the Holy See fleet had already fled in all directions. The small warship Hudson could no longer pay attention, and only the enemy's capital ship was left in his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the flagship ship, which is the focus of attention. Bear Stearns, who descended from the back of the dragon, landed on the flagship at the first stop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Earth Bear affected by \"Gou Dao\" has shrunk to the size of a show, and it's impossible to notice it if you don't pay attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, poisonous insects are everywhere on the ship, and it is not at all eye-catching to mix among them. However, it was this inconspicuous little guy who directly knocked an eighth-level magician into the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having made a good start, in the ensuing battles, people continued to be killed, either the whole person was knocked into the air, or the parts of the body were damaged.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The muddle-headed battle left everyone on board confused. He only heard the wails from his companions, but he had no idea what was going on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the commander, Moxis was the first to realize that something was wrong. As soon as he shouted \"There are still enemies on board\", his head suddenly flew out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before everyone could react, the warship began to sink rapidly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In just the blink of an eye, Bear Stearns had found the core of the magic circle, and slapped it, not only destroying the magic circle, but also creating a big hole in the cabin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately after that, there are countless large holes. The ship without the protection of the magic circle is just a pile of solid wood. The aftermath of the battle alone can send the warship into the sea, let alone a sanctuary bear that made a hole.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After groping for a successful experience, in order to reduce the probability of exposure, Bear Stearns no longer shoots at people. Every time he sneaks into a warship, he finds the core of the magic circle, and immediately flashes the bear after destroying it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are strong guards, they can't stop a sanctuary bear that concentrates on sneaking. As soon as the blow hit, the sea water poured in immediately, and it was too late to repair it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the sinking of warships one after another, Hudson gradually understood what was going on, and turned to his own dragon and asked, \"Have you learned, Maxim?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, who was absorbed in watching the excitement, never thought that Hudson would suddenly ask a question. He shook the faucet, and his mind was full of a series of greetings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Have you learned it?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What to learn?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hesitating for a while, he said with a look of disdain: \"What is there to learn, isn't it just sinking a few broken ships?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I were to go down, the custody would be better than him!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, don't forget that Bear Stearns is a land creature. When I get to the sea, I can beat a bear like him at both ends, unlike our dragon clan who are kings everywhere!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for your face, I would have taught him to be a bear long ago. Tian Tian dares to be with Uncle Long...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The topic of deviation made Hudson have to stop. The thinking patterns of humans and dragons are different after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He wants to keep it secret, so as not to attract revenge from the Holy See. But Maxim wished that the whole world would know about it, so that he could show his prestige.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, he was steady just now. If Maxim made a move, there is a high probability that it will not end now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the identity is really exposed, then they can only start the back-up, leading the fleets of the major coastal nobles to encircle and suppress the remaining Holy See fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the leader, it is true that you must attract the most hatred, but having a group of allies who share the hatred can also reduce some pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weather gradually brightened, the blood had already dissipated, the fish and shrimp in the sea carve up the last residue, and the sea surface slowly returned to calm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sun shines down again, refracted on the rising waves, like pearls flying out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the sawdust floating on the sea is telling the cruelty of the battle last night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking along the waves, you can occasionally see survivors holding boards and doing their final struggle against the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did not extend a loving hand, and did not add insult to injury. Without revealing his identity, Hudson chose to act as a bystander.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghost ship is still doing its final hunt, but that is no longer his focus. Annihilated the main warships of the three major fleets of the Holy See, the remaining ones are no longer worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See team that went deep into the misty sea has not been annihilated, and this war is not yet complete.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing can't be rushed, and without a suitable fighter, Hudson would rather wait forever.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Occasionally commanding the navy is probably acceptable to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Just now I went for a stroll on the sea, and found that the single Holy See warship fled in embarrassment, and something must have happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the Terran Alliance, we cannot watch our allies have accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send people out for all-round investigation, find out the situation as soon as possible, and then organize manpower for rescue. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is like this, some things can be done, but not said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to make it easier for everyone to understand, Hudson also deliberately emphasized the tone of \"allies\" and \"rescue\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the three major fleets of the Holy See are powerful, and there are few opponents in the entire continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there are a large number of masters accompanying the fleet, so it is almost impossible for accidents to happen under normal circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Could it be that the fleet was scattered by a storm? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Byron asked suspiciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the face of the mighty power of nature, human beings are insignificant. Humans can't knock down a fleet, but nature can.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once encountering a big storm at sea, even with the protection of a magic circle, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last time the Dalton family's fleet sank several warships in a storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I'm going to ask the people of the Holy See, the situation on the sea is changing, who knows what happened?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard that piracy has been rampant recently, and even warships that are alone dare to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you go to search and rescue, you should also be careful. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said casually.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things like adding insult to injury are not suitable for the navy to do, at least not flying its own flag to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They all hang out at sea all year round. Hudson doesn't believe that there are not a few pirates in the hands of the major families to do the dirty work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the time for the pirates to play.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's capital ships are gone, and the rest are small warships, and the personnel may not be fully staffed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to leave it to the pirates. Even if it leaked, it was done by pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With an extra fig leaf, the matter ended well. If it was a direct confrontation, it would be another political storm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, are there pirates ahead?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking in the direction pointed by his deputy, Odebiao happened to see a fleet flying the pirate flag, speeding towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The muzzle of the cannon had already aimed at them, and the moment Aodebiao hesitated, the magic crystal cannon on the opposite side had already sounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Damn pirates, dare to provoke...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Organize a counterattack immediately, and make them regret coming to this world!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boom, boom...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a short fight, Odebiao's warship was unfortunately shot and did not lose its combat effectiveness, but the flexibility of the warship dropped significantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Something's wrong, these people aren't pirates!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despicable alphas, let the navy pretend to be pirates...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quickly retreat! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, it was too late.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the territory of the Alpha Kingdom after all, and the best chance of escape has been lost since seeing the pirate ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar scenes keep happening on the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The \"pirates\" swarmed in, constantly hunting and killing the lone Holy See warships. Even the lucky one who was floating on the sea with a splint in his arms was not able to continue to be lucky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Quick, it's safe to leave here and enter the sea area of ​​the Kingdom of Hesse!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Powell kept urging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an old captain, with his rich experience, he escaped round after round of interceptions by \"pirates\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to increase the survivability, two Holy See warships that also fled in a hurry were pulled on the way, and the combined force of the three ships finally rushed to the border area of ​​the two countries' seas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally speaking, this kind of two-way zone is the favorite of pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But for the Holy See fleet that survived the catastrophe, this is the safest area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Real pirates are only seeking money, and the high-risk work of robbing warships has never been in the business scope of pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Powell missed a point. It is not only the Alpha Kingdom that wants the destruction of the Holy See fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Alpha and the Holy See had serious conflicts, and the Kingdom of Hesse, which was closer to the Holy See, could not have conflicts with the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The difference is that Alexander V was more tolerant. Even if there was a conflict with the Holy See, most of them chose to calm down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The longer the forbearance lasts, the more violent the outbreak will be.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After confirming that the Holy See fleet had an accident, the Alpha Kingdom immediately notified the news to its neighbors, and those who made trouble +1+1...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first Powell to rush out, it was very unfortunate that he became the first victim.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was about to approach the port for supplies, he was followed by a \"pirate\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain, these pirates really don't have eyes, they dare to follow all the way here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The pirates all ran to the vicinity of the port, clearly not paying attention to the fleet in the port. It is a miracle that the blind pirates here have not been wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, Powell realized something was wrong, and hurriedly ordered: \"Get away from the port, here...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the order was issued, several pirate ships came from the direction of the port, blocking their way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you look carefully, you can also find that under these pirate flags, there is also the flag of the Hesse Kingdom Navy that has just been put away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sound of the roaring magic crystal cannon rang out again, and the three Holy See warships that had been flanked back and forth did not escape after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the war ended and the pirate ships disappeared, the warships in the port slowly sailed out to \"hunt for the remnants of pirates\" on the sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fateful Powell had just been picked up from the sea, and before he could speak, he heard:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The captain caught a remnant of a pirate. This person actually wanted to get away with the Holy See military uniform. Such a vicious pirate should be hanged immediately!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Powell, who came to his senses, hurriedly shouted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am not a pirate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm not a pirate!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the body was exhausted, and he couldn't break free from the shackles on his body. The result of his roaring was a few big mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The noble officer headed by    beat Powell and said disdainfully: \"When all pirates are caught, they will say that they are not pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such a little trick, but also want to fool people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell you old boy, I said you are a pirate, you are a pirate, no! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a \"whoosh\" sound from the rope, Powell was hung on the mast, and after bouncing twice, he went to meet the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Good things don't go out, but bad things spread thousands of miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of the annihilation of the three major fleets of the Holy See quickly spread throughout the continent, and everyone was shocked by the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most direct impact is that the five grassland countries, which were still busy bargaining, reached an agreement with the Alpha Kingdom at lightning speed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, Pius VII gritted his teeth and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"This is impossible!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How could the three major fleets be wiped out?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Even if all the naval fleets of the Alpha Kingdom are gathered together, they are still no match for the three major fleets!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Roaring can't solve any problems, and more and more evidence shows that the three major fleets have indeed been wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Pius VII calmed down, Ulisse said slowly: \"Your Majesty, all three fleets have lost contact, and we are trying to find survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information from the Northern Continent Division, the Alpha Kingdom fleet made a big move in the name of suppressing pirates five days ago, and has yet to return to the port.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the fleet of the Kingdom of Hesse has also shown signs of making a big move recently. However, their fleet dispatch time is very short, just wiped out a few pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our people have observed from a distance, and the fleet of the Hesse Kingdom has not lost much, and it doesn't look like it has participated in a war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, there is too little time, and it is basically certain that they and the Alpha people are not the ones who have black hands on the three major fleets.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The intelligence department has already acted, as long as the Alpha people's fleet returns, we will receive the news as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such an explanation obviously did not satisfy Pius VII. Before the three major fleets went north, everyone assured him with one voice: the Alpha Navy is not an opponent of its own fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no absolute advantage, he will not send his main fleet to other people's doorsteps to provoke and seek excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's all right now, not to mention the total failure of political deterrence, the Holy See has become a joke across the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If nothing else happens, there is a high probability that this year's \"tithe\" income will be cut in half.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the deterrence of the naval fleet, those countries that do not border the Holy See will not obediently buy it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are countries that resist taxation on the mainland. The Kingdom of Alpha and the Kingdom of Franks have clearly stated that they don't have a single copper coin.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several other big family countries also paid a symbolic payment of 1.8 million gold coins.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as this incident happens, several major countries will definitely further reduce the amount of \"tithe\" payment, and it is not impossible to not pay it directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Small and medium-sized countries do not have the courage to directly resist taxes, but bargaining is still possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See is hostile by all parties. In addition to disputes over theocracy and monarchy, there are also real interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the most pious believers will still be unhappy if they ask people to pay taxes every day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, the nobles are not easy to fool, each of them is very clear about the difference between the Holy See and the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To add insult to injury to the Holy See is to save money for oneself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the two are equated, the situation of the Holy See on the mainland will naturally not be too good.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hurry up and find out what happened as soon as possible, I don't believe that the Alpha people have the strength to eat the three major fleets!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now is the period of the Continental War, even if they can do it, they will suffer heavy losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too much power has been lost, what can they use to resist alien invasion? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't know that his own people divided up the army first. In the eyes of Pius VII, the power that could destroy the three major fleets was enough to affect the sea situation. He couldn't sleep or eat without knowing the reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, he no longer cared so much about the chain reaction triggered by it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Things have already happened, just do whatever you want, and just wait to clean up the mess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beyond the sea of ​​mist, Hudson is leading the kingdom fleet to \"encircle and suppress ghost ships\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is fog to cover, and the specific target cannot be seen. Anyway, there are ships approaching and bombarded with magic crystals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, Marshal, this is the world of ghost ships. Do the fish that slipped through the net of the Holy See really dare to go in?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, it has been like a dream for everyone. The awesome fleet of the Holy See was scrapped as soon as it entered the misty sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they hadn't confirmed the news again and again, they would have suspected that they had fallen into a bewilderment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What do you think?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the idiots of the Holy See hadn't run into the sea of ​​mist, they would have ended up where they are now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't you think that the three ghost ships can wipe out the Holy See fleet from the outside world? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    False and true, real and false.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if Hudson personally leads the battle, he must be able to lead everyone's thinking into the ditch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you're wrong, it's all guesswork anyway. Just enough to prove that the attack on the Holy See fleet has nothing to do with him, Lord Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the fleet is his own, Hudson can't guarantee that so many officers and soldiers will be loyal to the kingdom and will not be bought by the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the army returns, it is estimated that what happened along the way will be known to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter if you expose the news that makes people worse. Whether there is any evidence, the Holy See can guess.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the relationship between the two parties, if the kingdom doesn't play tricks, there will be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Hudson cannot afford to command the ghost ship and destroy the main force of the Holy See fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To deceive the enemy, first deceive your own people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Think about it, the Holy See fleet went deep into the sea of ​​mist, and was almost wiped out by the ghost ship attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, the representatives of all parties involved broke out in a cold sweat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before that, everyone formed a team to encircle and suppress the ghost ship, and they were also preparing to go deep into the sea of ​​mist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that we were worried about the loss too much later, and everyone took it easy, otherwise the tragedy is not just the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Almost in an instant, everyone made a decision in their hearts, and the misty sea area will be a forbidden area for the family in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the issue of the ghost ship, when the opponent comes out, they will form a team to encircle and suppress them. If they stay in it all the time, they will pretend they didn't see it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside, the fight is in full swing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See personnel who went deep into the sea of ​​mist, except for the ordinary sailors who drove the ship, the rest were masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The way of fighting against ordinary warships naturally cannot play a role here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three ghost kings commanded the ghosts, and kept throwing poisonous insects on the warship. Unfortunately, except for the initial success, all the latter failed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even digging deep into the bottom of the sea to dig a ship, before the ghost approached the warship, it was scrapped by the other party's masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It looks like a ghost is attacking, but in fact it is almost like giving away a head. Apart from wasting the opponent's physical strength, it has no real meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the cover of fog and the location of the ghost ship could not be found, they would have been beaten by the opponent and fled in all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Receiving the phantoms' pleas for help, Hudson was also very helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naturally there are reinforcements, but he can't reveal his identity!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the people of the Holy See want to come out of the misty sea, then there is nothing to say, just let the fleet concentrate their firepower on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that people are tossing in the sea area, they can only wait first. Anyway, the other party has no supplies, so if it continues to consume like this, it will collapse sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Boss, these people are not easy to deal with, the Lord only asks us to drag them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, they are also lost now, why don't we digest the previous harvest first, and then look for their bad luck. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghost king in white suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Constantly dying, even ghosts are exhausted physically and mentally. The outside world only knows that ghosts are immortal. In fact, ghosts need energy to revive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continuous flow is because they are killing each other, and the energy generated by these killings is absorbed by the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past few days, the three ghost ships have been fed up, and they urgently need to digest the results.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, I wanted to go all out and win these high-quality blood food. Facts have proved that their strength is still not enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the three of them go up in person, they can't stand up to the opponent's masters and attack them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Then let them go for a while, and wait for me to digest the harvest, and then come to a decisive battle with them!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, the three ghost kings turned the bow of the boat and left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to withdraw the ghosts in the battle. After dying in battle, they will return to the ship to be reborn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unless they encounter the domain of a powerful sanctuary, these ghosts cannot leave the ghost ship for a long time. Even if he is captured by the opponent, he will come back soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle was over, but Harmodi was not happy at all. The fleet outside has completely lost contact, and it is completely unknown whether it is dead or alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Their team of encircling and suppressing the ghost ship found their target, but unfortunately the enemy was too slick, and they couldn't grasp it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a big battle, except for killing groups of ghosts, no effective results were achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Commander, the situation is not good. Our sailors suffered heavy casualties, and driving three warships at the same time may be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this answer, Hammadi was so angry that he vomited blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never imagined that one day he would worry about the shortage of lowly sailors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are a lot of masters on board, but to command everyone to do coolies, thinking about Hammadi gives me a headache.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The difficulty is only temporary, you should overcome it first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Adjust the original two shifts, let some people work on long shifts, and wait until they are out of the foggy sea area. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two days later, the way back was not found, but the legendary Dulong Island appeared in front of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing land at last is undoubtedly a cause for celebration for those who have been at sea for two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that this is Dulong Island, a ghostly place with nothing on it except poisonous insects and beasts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to expect extra supplies, even if you find a water source, everyone dare not drink it!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this place can also be regarded as a treasure land for some dark-type powerhouses who cultivate sideways.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to go ashore to explore has become another problem that plagued Harmodi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, our supplies are running out, we should find our way back as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the fleet is still waiting for us to go out to rescue. We have wasted too much time here, and we can't explain the heavy losses of the fleet. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the white-haired pastor finished speaking, the old man in black robes objected:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It was hard to find Dulong Island, how could I give up so easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the information we have collected, the artifact may have been brought to Dulong Island by those traitors, and we will not be able to explain it until we go back to find out! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides have good reasons, Hammodi's head was in a fog, and after hesitating for a while, he ordered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enter the island to explore for two days, regardless of whether there is any harvest, you must rush back to meet up.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to wait for the Holy See fleet to come out, and Hudson also secretly complained. It has been delayed for such a long time, and there are still a lot of things waiting for him in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But if this opportunity to weaken the Holy See is given up, Hudson is not reconciled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The regiment wiped out this group of masters, and the high-end power of the Holy See was reduced by at least 10%.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You wait outside, I'll go in and check the situation first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson finished speaking, everyone hurriedly stopped: \"Marshal, the sea of ​​mist is too dangerous, why not...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that everyone really cares about him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the current situation of the Alpha Kingdom, no one can do without him as the commander in chief of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Until the end of the Continental War, the Hudson was the kingdom's most valuable asset.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the event of an accident, it will be difficult to find a replacement in a short period of time, and it will be a disaster for all major forces in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, this sea area is not too big. Even if you lose your way, you can fly out in any direction you choose.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just fell into everyone's ears, this is thick Versailles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sea of ​​mist covering an area of ​​hundreds of thousands of square kilometers is really not a big place for a giant dragon. But for the human race, it could be fatal at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A dragon chant broke through the air, and Hudson went deep into the misty sea again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dense fog blocked his sight, but it couldn't block the sight of the giant dragon. Maxim shuttled through the sea area with ease, and soon found the location of Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are three warships below, which should belong to the Holy See. Do you want them to destroy them?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Bear Stearns' voice transmission, Hudson almost doubted his ears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ship docked at Dulong Island again. Could it be that this place is incompatible with the attributes of the Holy See?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he was still worrying about **** this group of people, but now he doesn't need to think so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as these ships are killed, the probability that the guys on the island can leave alive is about zero.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Bear Stearns, first check to see if the master on board has left, and then do it if there is no danger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the ghost ship to come, and they need to take the blame for this matter. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said cautiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the top forces of the oldest human race, no one knows how many hidden methods the Holy See has.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example: the pope's exclusive big prophecy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What happened this time was enough for them to use special methods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Theoretically speaking, the pope cannot see the fate line of the strong in the sanctuary, but it is hard to guarantee that he does not have the magic of time travelling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hidden a bit deeper, even if the battlefield is restored, he cannot be found on the head of Master Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for more accurate predictions, Hudson is not bragging, and the artifact in his hand is not vegetarian.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't need to be used, just carrying it on the body can mess up the fate line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this were not the case, the Holy See would not have been able to find its own artifact for a long time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jade Palace, after receiving the good news, Caesar IV finally showed a long-lost smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom has not even made a move, and the people of the Holy See have played themselves to death. It feels like a fairy tale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reports of several great nobles along the coast are all similar. Regarding the tragedy of the annihilation of the Holy See fleet, everyone unanimously concluded that the commander of the Holy See was too stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The question of making a shot worse, everyone tacitly did not mention it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all done by pirates, and had nothing to do with the kingdom's army. The biggest responsibility of the kingdom is nothing more than not timely rescue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this kind of thing can't be said, no one knows that the Holy See fleet is so powerful, it will be wiped out!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Knowing that the magic crystal cannon can't work in the foggy sea area, you dare to bring the fleet in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the Holy See is really in decline, and any cat or dog can occupy a high position! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the high level of the Holy See is at this level, then there is no need to worry. Without the kingdom's action, they will play themselves to death sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Caesar IV's idea of ​​setting up a separate Holy See deepened a bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the entire fleet of the Holy See fleet was wiped out, and the matter may not end so easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe those guys from Holy Mountain are crazy now. If the murderer is not found, who knows what they have done.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since we didn't do it, there's no need to come out to spread hatred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is best to spread the information in our hands secretly, and let them go to the ghost ship to settle accounts! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Francis gloated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ending now is really perfect. What Wang Guo wanted to do but was unable to do, was so muddled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the ghost ship is not also a hostile force, he would like to award a medal to the other party.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Um!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Find an opportunity to release the news, so that people on the whole continent know that the top leaders of the Holy See are a group of nepotism idiots.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the threat of the Holy See is gone, but the pressure on our coast has increased. The existence of the ghost ship is also a threat to the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's fine if the opponent has been hiding in the sea of ​​mist, but it's going to be a big trouble if they go to the outside world to be active.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That is a terrifying existence that can destroy the fleet of the Holy See! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said with mixed joy and sorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he is worried about the loss of the coastal nobles, but mainly because in the coming war, the kingdom will rely heavily on the dried fish provided by the coastal provinces.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Five days have passed since the battle of Dulong Island.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After destroying all the ships, Hudson returned to the capital. As for the life and death of the Holy See and his party, it was no longer in his consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the ghost ship watching, even if a merchant ship enters by mistake, it is impossible to take people away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rescue\", just think about it. The ominous name of the ghost ship has resounded throughout the entire continent at this moment, and everyone knows that the three major fleets of the Holy See were completely wiped out in the foggy sea area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for what exactly happened, apart from the mastermind Hudson, even the tycoon of the Alpha Kingdom can only rely on guesswork, let alone others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how curious you are, no big power is willing to take meaningless adventures with your wealth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the news of a large number of survivors has not yet spread. The news received by the Holy See was that \"the whole army was destroyed\", and they would not organize a rescue at all, nor did they have the courage to send a fleet to search and rescue again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After being idle, Hudson returned his attention to army training. The focus of this training is not the standing army in the kingdom, but the elite of the kingdom that has just been put together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laoshi's expedition to carry out surprise raids not only requires high physical fitness of the soldiers, but also requires very high organizational and management capabilities of the army. Strengthening the cooperation between the various units is also a top priority.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the beginning, it was agreed to send 50,000 troops, but in the end it couldn't support the public relations of the Principality of Moxi, and had to increase the total troops to 100,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, whether it is dispatching 50,000 reinforcements or 100,000 reinforcements, it is just an imaginary number. There are still so many people who act in the end, and the difference is only limited to the counting method.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a series of screenings, Hudson finally selected 35,000 people, plus the number of livestock, he made up a 100,000 army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that Hudson doesn't want to increase his troops, it's a pity that there are only a few elite soldiers in the Royal Army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the ordinary army, all soldiers in this army are practitioners and have even been on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The source of soldiers is either the knights of the great nobles, or the elite of the standing army, and the core private army elite of the small and medium nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the contribution of Ha's Ripening Potion, the kingdom has managed to gather 5,000 monster cavalry this time, and the number of flying monster cavalry alone exceeds 1,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The major forces in the country are all nervous now, lest there will be accidents in the next operation. In order to reassure everyone, Hudson, the commander-in-chief of the army, had to come out to \"perform\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the Terran Alliance investigation team will arrive in the kingdom soon, Your Majesty invites you to discuss the matter!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three major fleets of the Holy See were completely destroyed. Naturally, such a sensational incident on the mainland would not be easily subsided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to maintain the unity and stability within the human race, the human race alliance must intervene in the investigation. It's one thing to find out whether or not to find out, but political posture must be present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"knew.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson replied blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The destruction of the Holy See fleet had nothing to do with him in the eyes of the outside world, but it was different in the eyes of the high-level kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Fighting off a ghost ship\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Strongly advocated leading the Holy See fleet northward\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Ghost Ship Destroyed the Holy See's Three Fleets\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taken apart, each item is mediocre, but connected together is: \"Strong strength + outstanding strategic vision\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ghost ship destroyed the Holy See fleet, which directly raised Hudson's force value in the eyes of the outside world. Many people speculated that Maxim became the Dragon King, and a small group of people suspected that Bear Stearns was the Bear King.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interpretation is impossible. If the outside world likes to misunderstand, it's okay to misunderstand. Hudson will not expose the true strength of his mount just to make everyone feel at ease.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hazy doubts are best. It is better to be fearful than to be despised, which can avoid many unnecessary troubles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson is here!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The attendant's voice sounded, and the noisy hall fell silent instantly. Originally, this was the treatment of King Caesar IV, and now Hudson also enjoys it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Status stems from strength. After the successful calculation of the Holy See fleet, Hudson's status in the kingdom has become more and more detached.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Hudson is still not drifting away. He is very clear that the special status he now enjoys is entirely based on the premise of the kingdom's needs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the war is over. No matter how detached the status he enjoys now, the fear he will receive in the future will be as serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has nothing to do with moral standards, it is entirely derived from interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one wants to see a situation where one family dominates. No matter how great his contribution is, no matter how good his friendship with all parties is, no one will be soft when it is time to restrict his actions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best choice is to use the war period to accumulate enough strength, share a large piece of cake after the war, and then go home to farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't stay in the capital to be an eyesore, there will be no \"master of high merit\". Time can dilute everything. When Hudson is older, he should be worshiped on the altar by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is also possible that right after the war, there will be a lot of high hats presented to push him to the altar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many times, fame and profit are opposite to each other. You can't have both, if you get too much fame, the actual benefits you can share will be reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It depends on the means of Caesar IV. If the operation goes well, it will be a good story of a monarch and his ministers; if the operation is wrong, it is not surprising that a powerful minister is created to take over the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just look at the Warhammer Kingdom. The last king, Joseph II, failed to balance the balance, making people inside and outside, and the kingdom was split into two.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nominally, his son succeeded to the throne, but in fact both of them were empty kings. The only ones who can issue orders are the royal palace and the royal leaders, and even the control over the royal leaders is very general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know if he was waiting for him deliberately, but just as Hudson greeted everyone, the voice of \"His Majesty the King is here\" sounded outside the hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big man made his final appearance, and Caesar IV still grasped this point very well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike Hudson, the arrival time is irregular, and it is possible to arrive early or late. It happened to be the penultimate arrival like today, and it was the first time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is just a coincidence, it will inevitably be interpreted politically if it falls into the eyes of someone with a heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Regarding the destruction of the Holy See fleet, the Terran Alliance has decided to set up an investigation team to investigate the ins and outs of the incident.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a member of the alliance, the kingdom should fully cooperate. Especially the nobles in the coastal areas must ensure the safety of the investigation team. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing what Caesar IV said, Hudson couldn't help but feel happy. It seemed that the king couldn't hold back any longer, and wanted to jump out to gain a sense of presence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, such topics were first discussed by the ministers of the DPRK and China, and after listening to the opinions of all parties, the king made a final decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of meaningless meeting, the great nobles from all over the world will naturally not make a special trip. Hudson, who regarded himself as a feudal noble, seldom participated in such meetings even if he was in the capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the most important thing is that people did not invite. In name, it does not delay military affairs, but in fact, it does not want to have one more separation of powers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV skipped the procedure to make a decision, which was also a matter between the king and the court ministers, and Hudson, who had nothing to do with himself, went straight into the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regardless of who is investigating, the final conclusion will only be that the ghost ship committed the crime.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pirates\" have made trouble, what does that have to do with the kingdom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the Holy See fleet entered the kingdom's waters, the representative of the Alpha Kingdom sent a sea chart, and by the way reminded them of the risks in the foggy sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the officers of the Holy See are willing to listen to the persuasion, follow the example of the previous kingdom fleet, and honestly guard the gate of the misty sea area, waiting for the ghost ship to come out to hunt, the entire army will definitely not be wiped out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that no one responded below, Caesar IV frowned slightly. It's too disrespectful to him as a king. If it was in his father's era, who would dare to be so presumptuous!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The idea of ​​changing people took root in Caesar IV's heart at this moment. Once the king and the courtiers, the new king can endure for several years without changing people, which is very rare in the whole continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Hudson couldn't believe that Caesar IV could hold back for so long. If there is no accident, he will continue to endure it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the end of the Continental War, any political fluctuations are not allowed. Even the king, the current power is squeezed very severely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At present, apart from Hudson's general headquarters, the Kingdom's Military Affairs Department is the most powerful in the kingdom, and the rest of the kingdom's departments revolve around these two departments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV, who was deprived of his military dominance, actually had very limited power in his hands.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is because the war has not yet started. Once the kingdom enters a state of war, the presence of the king will be even lower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since everyone has no opinion, let's settle the matter like this!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    East and West Warhammer Kingdoms can't count on it, and the foreign coalition forces are about to invade the Principality of Moxi. Marshal Hudson, how are you preparing for the army's expedition? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, the queen has often talked about his hometown in his ears. Although he was not directly asked to send troops, Caesar IV could still understand the meaning revealed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the army is currently in a state of running-in. After the various ministries are familiar with each other, they can send troops.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said perfunctorily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the army will act and how it will act are all highly classified military secrets. It is impossible for him to leak it before it is implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The king naturally wouldn't leak secrets on purpose, but it's hard to guarantee that there are no big mouthers around him. In case the news reaches the ears of foreign races and the enemy makes targeted deployments, it will be a complete disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Principality of Moxi, he had already communicated. Just relying on him, Marshal Hudson, to lead the troops himself, is enough to shut their mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Specifically how to fight and when to intervene, then there is no need for laymen to direct experts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the holy mountain, looking at the information gathered in his hands, Pius VII was so angry that he didn't know how to comment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news of \"the entire fleet was destroyed\" has been verified, but the actual situation is slightly different from what was expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Are you sure that the Alpha Kingdom's navy has not suffered heavy damage recently?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was barely able to accept that the entire army was wiped out by the enemy's sneak attack. But now all kinds of evidence point to the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the news is true, then the root cause of the fleet's entire army's destruction has become its own commander—too stupid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII had many issues to consider. Inbreeding in the Holy See was serious, and it had long been an open secret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The interior of the navy is so bad, what about the army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the people in high positions are a bunch of idiots, the Holy See will be in danger. In name they are the top forces, but the real strength of Pius VII is really uncertain!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the war launched against the dwarf kingdom, you can see that it clearly has an absolute advantage, but in the end it fell into a fierce battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Two things are linked together, Pius VII's confidence in his own army, it was dropped again and again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, we have verified this matter many times. The Alpha Kingdom's naval fleet is fully established. Only three warships are currently returning to the factory for maintenance due to combating pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a sea battle with our fleet, their fleet will at least suffer heavy losses, if not completely destroyed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only a few warships were slightly injured, that is impossible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse replied with a serious face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Helping the enemy eliminate suspicion, he is not willing. But there is no way, the facts are in front of you, you can't just stick to the hat!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although he often does this kind of thing, the situation is obviously different now. If it is insisted that the Alpha Kingdom did it, the two sides will inevitably go to war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that the Human Race Alliance refused to agree, and even the Holy See couldn't pass it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to live a rich life, and no one is willing to gamble with uncertainty. The destruction of the three major fleets ruined not only the warships, but also everyone's confidence in the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Who recommended those idiots?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leading the fleet into the sea of ​​mist, what the Alpha people dare not do, why would they dare to do it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII asked almost roaringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The survivors of the fleet were either hunted and killed by \"pirates\" or executed as \"pirates\". Even the link of extorting confessions was omitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lacking first-hand information, the conclusions of Alpha Kingdom's brain supplements have become the standard version of the answer, which directly affects the judgment of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except that the fleet went deep into the misty sea and was attacked by a ghost ship, no one could think of a more reasonable explanation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, there is no point in pursuing these now. Judging from the results of the battlefield, the ghost ship that attacked our fleet is likely to be the legendary ghost ship in the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the guess is correct, then the Alpha Kingdom has assembled a fleet to destroy the ghost ship, but it has not taken action for a long time, which can also be explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is said that before this, the fleet of the Dalton family suffered heavy losses in the fight against the ghost ship. Even if Hudson took the shot himself, it only repelled the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a dragon suspected to be the Dragon King + an adult Earth Bear, and a large number of warships providing fire support, it is really unreasonable that the eighth-order ghost ship cannot be left behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps it was the Kingdom of Alpha, knowing the power of the ghost ship, that deliberately lured us to go north, playing with a borrowed knife to kill people. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ulisse spoke persuasively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pursuing responsibility is a major event that affects the whole body. Once the lid of cronyism is lifted, it is very difficult to put it back on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If things get worse and expose the dark side of the Holy See, the adverse effects will only be greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength of the ghost ship was overestimated to the holy level, and those who originally wanted to send people to investigate also chose to shut up at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loss of the Holy See this time is already very serious. If they continue to send people there, they will be sending heads to the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"snort!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a cold shout, a huge aura emanated from Pius VII, causing everyone to retreat one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The faces of the people who reacted instantly turned cloudy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Congratulations, Your Majesty, for breaking through the sanctuary!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The continuous sound of congratulations dispelled the dark clouds over everyone's heads, at least on the bright side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for whether Pius VII had just broken through the sanctuary, or whether he had broken through a long time ago and deliberately concealed his strength from the outside world, this is not important at all. The key is to break through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They were all forced out, and the position of Pope Pius VII was also shaken by repeated accidents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't break through the sanctuary and bring back a wave of prestige for yourself, maybe the people below will abolish the pope in series.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"alright!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The grievances of the Alpha people, we will settle with them in the future. Once the reason for the annihilation of the entire army is found, the matter will come to an end for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, everyone needs to do a good job of comforting the families of the officers and soldiers who died in battle. They are the most loyal soldiers of the Holy See, and their affairs must be handled properly. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII said pretending to be sentimental.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He kept silent about the news about his breakthrough into the sanctuary, and only talked about the aftermath of the fallen officers and soldiers. If this wave of operations is spread to the bottom, it will definitely gain a large number of supporters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Those who can enter here are supported by an interest group behind them, and there are naturally many of them in the navy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the table is overturned and the responsibility is investigated in depth, even if it is not directly taken off the water, it will not look good in face!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If it were another person, it would be a folk talk after dinner, and it would not achieve the effect of sensationalizing the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only ones who were really stimulated were the eighth-level powerhouses who were stuck outside the gate of the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, everyone stopped at the peak of the eighth order, and even if there was a gap between them, it would not be too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But now, in the blink of an eye, that guy Pius VII broke through the sanctuary first, and directly opened up a level with everyone, which made many old antiques unhappy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For a while, everyone is retreating, looking for opportunities, looking for opportunities, anyway, no one is idle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to his unusual status, the strength of Pius VII is also the focus of everyone's attention. In the eyes of many people, he has a three-piece magic weapon in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance artifact bestowed by the Lord of Dawn fully matches the attributes of Pius VII, and the power of backlash when used is definitely the smallest among all artifacts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the eighth level, the pope, who holds a three-piece set of artifacts, can fight against the strong in the sanctuary. Now that this threshold has been crossed, the strength of the artifact against Pius VII will be even stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII, who has gathered magic attack, physical attack, and comprehensive defense artifacts at the same time, is an invincible existence in the eyes of many people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title of the most powerful man in the mainland has now fallen to Pius VII. Hudson looked envious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What I envy is not the title of the number one powerhouse, Pius VII who lost two attack artifacts, this number one powerhouse is too dehydrated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the Holy See has other artifacts, they were snatched from other places, and their use is definitely not as smooth as inheritance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII, with full defensive attributes and insufficient attack power, is obviously not the most powerful person in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to bully those under the sanctuary, but you can only take advantage of the strong ones of the same level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, although the artifact is easy to use, it also consumes a lot of energy!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guardian enchantment released also has a time limit. Gathering more than a dozen powerhouses of the eighth rank to besiege, Pius VII will be able to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it is limited to driving away. The strong at the sanctuary level, as long as they don't die, they basically can't die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Invincibility is always relative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the sacred crown in the hands of Pius VII still made Hudson drool enviously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Exclusive defensive artifacts, the number of such gadgets is really too rare. With the sacred crown body protection, the personal safety factor will definitely be greatly improved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Affected by Pius VII's breakthrough in the sanctuary, a special meeting was held in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Different from the previous meetings, except for the prime minister and the king, the rest of the participants in this meeting were eighth-rank powerhouses from all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom's combat power, Hudson will naturally be missing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pis VII broke through the sanctuary, proving that the door of the sanctuary is open to humans again. In the next few years, the mainland will surely emerge strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I invite you to come here today, mainly to provide a platform for you to exchange cultivation experience and exchange cultivation materials. I hope you can break through the sanctuary as soon as possible. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sanctuary can't be broken through just by thinking about it, it seems like a reincarnation. Every few hundred years in the mainland, there will be a wave of strong people, followed by hundreds of years of silence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who catch up with the times are full of powerful people, miss the opportunities of the times, and those who can break through against the world are the talents of the sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the entire Aslant continent, there are not many eighth-level powerhouses in the Alpha Kingdom, but these powerhouses are all coming out of the battlefield, and their combat effectiveness is slightly better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But to break through the sanctuary, these alone are not enough. Rich combat experience and comprehension of laws are two completely different fields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to think about the treasures that help comprehend the law at all. They are all legendary things, which can be encountered but not sought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What the kingdom can do is to provide a platform for everyone to communicate and communicate, hoping that someone can take this crucial step.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this regard, Hudson has no say. Although he has a sanctuary mount, he is still weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon and Bear are both born with talent, and their breakthrough experience has no reference value for human beings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Communication means that everyone is responsible for speaking and Hudson is responsible for listening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, many of us have been stuck outside the sanctuary for many years, and now we are short of the final touch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But it was precisely this last step that trapped countless heroes throughout the ages.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it was before the destruction of the Holy See Fleet, I would suggest friends of the dark department to plan the core of the ghost ship. But now, I can only advise everyone to give up the idea of ​​looking for external assistance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morrison said meaningfully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who can step into this realm are either talented or crazy. Now the sanctuary realm has become an obsession in many people's hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to break through the realm, they can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy for the kingdom to accumulate some masters. Morrison doesn't want to see everyone rushing to the misty sea to die in order to seize the opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Morrison, what you're talking about is nonsense. The three major fleets of the Holy See all set out, accompanied by eighty if not a hundred eighth-level masters, and they were all wiped out in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only eight powerhouses in the kingdom who cultivate the dark system. Isn't it to give away their heads? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Robert said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be complaining to Morrison, but it is actually directed at the strong practitioners of the dark department in the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Robert deliberately glanced at the two great undead magisters who were eager to try, full of warning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a little hesitation, the two great undead magisters finally did not refute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are also among the top experts in the kingdom, but when it comes to the network of connections, the Dean Robert beats them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the dark-type powerhouses mobilize contacts together, it will be difficult to pull everyone to take risks with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alpha Kingdom can't afford to gamble, and the forces behind the powerful can't afford to gamble either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, even if you get the core, it's not enough for everyone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lutetia Palace, Charles III, who also received the news of Pius VII's breakthrough, looked at the crowd and said mockingly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See is out of skills this time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The expedition fleet was completely wiped out. I thought they would take revenge and destroy the ghost ship hiding in the misty sea with thunder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Never expected that they would use the news that Pius VII broke through the sanctuary to divert their attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the spokesperson of the Lord of Dawn in the world, half of the popes in the past have broken through the sanctuary, and it is not surprising to add another one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But I don't believe it was such a coincidence that he broke through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I'm afraid that the Holy See's layout failed one after another, and Pius VII's position as pope was unstable, so he had to announce it to the outside world. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Breaking through the sanctuary is a good thing, but this kind of news is always announced as late as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current stimulation has stimulated the fighting spirit of the eighth-level powerhouses in the whole continent, which is not of much benefit to the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that a lot of reputation has been restored, but in the eyes of real powerful forces, this has exposed the weak nature of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really have the confidence, then immediately start revenge and go back, showing the domineering power of the top forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Three ghost ships, as long as the Holy See is willing to spend, they can definitely take them down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The outside world does not care about objective factors, let alone the risks involved. Everyone only sees that the Holy See is cowardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The strength shown by the Holy See will directly affect the foreign policies of various countries towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, after this continental war, the power of foreign races will surely decline further. Now that the Holy See is showing signs of decadence again, this is indeed the best opportunity for the kingdom to go further.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Our next plan can speed up the pace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is necessary for the front line to speed up the destruction of the half-orc kingdom. If it takes too long, it will be troublesome if the situation in the North Continent collapses first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Duke Bergson said murderously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the first kingdom on the mainland, the military strength of the Frankish Kingdom is no worse than some empires in the history of the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It failed to become an empire. In addition to the opposition of various countries, the most important thing is the obstruction of the Holy See.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Empires in the past all had one common feature—divine authority of the emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the Holy See grows stronger, the power of the empire is still guaranteed, and the most honorable status on the mainland is the emperor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after the Holy See grew stronger, theocracy slowly took the dominant position in the struggle, and the Pope gradually became the boss on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next collapse of the empire, in addition to internal interest disputes, the Holy See's fuel is also an important factor.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After overthrowing the rule of the Holy See with great difficulty, the Kingdom of Franks was naturally unwilling to bow to the Holy See for the sake of the name of an empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom continued to grow stronger, the voice of establishing a separate Holy See became louder and louder in the Frankish Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no legal basis, then find a way to create it yourself. If the Holy See is not obedient, then change to an obedient Holy See to manage the faith.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Prime Minister, once we destroy the orc kingdom, the elves will definitely join the battle immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The collapse of the situation in the northern continent is almost a foregone conclusion. The Alpha Kingdom is likely to adopt a strategic contraction and let the elf army go south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Currently, the war situation among countries in the mainland is still in a stalemate, and the advantages of the human race have not been brought into play. If the elves army joins the war, the situation in the central mainland is likely to reverse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time…\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Foreign Minister Marquis Jesús said worriedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not all human nations are as powerful as the Frankish Kingdom; nor are all alien races like the half-orc kingdoms, who are dying of being suppressed by them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The current stalemate on the battlefield is mainly due to the fact that the Frankish Kingdom is training with half-orcs and has not launched an offensive with all its strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once it gets ruthless, it will naturally destroy the Orc Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, this war was initiated by them when they were prepared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation on the mainland really needs to be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the major powers on the mainland, the Alpha Kingdom is under the greatest pressure. They simply cannot stop the elf army from going south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the strength of the three major kingdoms in Central China is not weak. They still have spare power, which should be to prevent the army of elves from going south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can't defeat the elf army, they can hold back the enemy, and the situation won't deteriorate much in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When we stabilize the fruits of victory, we will send troops to support them, and there will be enough time in terms of time. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Duke Bergson said lightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that he is not concerned about the life and death of the countries in the central region, and even plans to take the opportunity to consume the three countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politics is so realistic. After annexing the half-orc kingdom, Frank's national power will further increase, and its advantages over other countries will become more obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the boss, suppressing potential threats in advance can only be regarded as a routine operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The prime minister is right. The current situation has changed. Some of the kingdom's foreign policies in the past also need to conform to the times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order to intensify the offensive strength of all ministries. I hope to defeat the Orc Kingdom within three months and completely destroy them within one year! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Charles III said domineeringly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Hesse, Alexander V was startled when he first heard that Pius VII broke through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't panic, as one of the participants who made trouble for the Holy See fleet, if the Holy See investigates deeply, they will be able to find them out sooner or later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the Holy See directly, Alexander V still felt a little bit drummed in his heart. It's just that this anxiety disappeared quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The Holy See actually gave up?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII had at least three artifacts in his hands, all of which happened to restrain ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There must be other reasons behind such a good opportunity for him to give up. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V frowned and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The same thing falls into different eyes, and the problems seen are naturally different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the contemporary monarchs, Alexander V was not a pushy person. When encountering problems, they usually think twice before acting, a typical representative of a moderate monarch.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if he was also unhappy with the Holy See, Alexander V never confronted the Holy See directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, this time the survivors of the Holy See fleet were black-handed, and they all acted in pirate vests, leaving enough room for buffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the Pope didn't take the opportunity of breaking through the sanctuary to launch a counterattack. Perhaps it is not the ghost ship that is afraid, but the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    suffered a loss once, if they take action again, they will definitely not be able to take the fleet together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without the protection of the army, just a group of masters ran to the sea area of ​​​​the Alpha Kingdom to do things, and the danger inside was definitely not small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the Alpha people suddenly turn their faces, it will be difficult for them to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from other factors, the three inherited artifacts in the hands of Pius VII alone are worth the secret hands of the Alpha people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if their family can't eat, they can ask the Franks who are also at odds with the Holy See for help. There are so many forces who are concerned about inheriting the artifacts, and they don't have to worry about having no allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was easy for Pius VII to take these artifacts out, but it was difficult to bring them back. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Duke Milton analyzed with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't say that Alpha and Frank are two countries that are hostile to the Holy See. Even a big country with a good relationship with the Holy See will most likely not be tempted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the legal order of the Holy See, and whoever gets it will have the initiative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is negotiating with the Holy See to strive for more rights, or directly establishing a new portal, this is the most important bargaining chip.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's exactly as the Prime Minister said. If Pius VII dared to come out with the artifact, I couldn't help but shoot it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forget it, this kind of good thing is impossible to happen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pius VII was not stupid, even if he came out with an artifact, he would visit in an aboveboard manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We can't miss the artifact, let's think about how much benefit we can get from the destruction of the Holy See fleet! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Disappointment is false, and relief is the truth. It would be a real problem if the holy artifact inherited from the Holy See had been delivered right under his nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a middle-continent country, the Kingdom of Hesse inevitably became the site of the Fourth World War. It is a treasure for other countries to take the artifact, but they have become a disaster when they take the artifact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the artifacts of the legal system, whoever grabs the legal system does not follow whoever, and it must be proved that the source of the artifact is legal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for obtaining the artifact can be made up at will, but the only thing is that you can't grab it openly. Once something is on the surface, there is no way to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the destruction of the Holy See fleet and their international influence plummeted, which is of great benefit to the Kingdom's overseas trade development.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, these are long-term benefits. In a short period of time, the benefits we can obtain are mainly the payment ratio of tithes, which can be further reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How much it can be reduced, still needs to be negotiated with the Holy See. If the kingdom is firm, no matter how much we propose to drop, they will choose to compromise. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Backstrom said enthusiastically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the outbreak of the war, the finances of the Kingdom of Hesse had been very good. As long as there is no major natural disaster, the treasury will have a surplus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the war broke out, the situation changed drastically. Years of accumulation of finances and taxes are not worth mentioning in front of the gold-swallowing beast of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there is no high debt at present, the fiscal deficit of the Kingdom of Hesse has indeed appeared, and it is still expanding rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is an opportunity to cut the flesh of the Holy See and make up for its own financial insufficiency, the Ministry of Finance must of course strive for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The countries that are demanding to lower the tithe should not be one or two countries. There is no need for the kingdom to rush to the front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First use the need for war as an excuse to withhold this year's tithe. After the war is over, the results of the negotiations between the Holy See and all parties are estimated to have come out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, refer to the negotiation results of various countries, and then use the results to negotiate with the Holy See. I think their acceptance ability should be improved a lot. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Alexander V said calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Didn't mention how to deal with the “tithes” withheld during the war, and it's clear that it's a bad idea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The resumption of negotiations after the war seemed to be full of sincerity, but in fact they were waiting for an excuse to cut the \"tithe tax\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    War, there must be some damage. Exaggerating the losses is the best justification for cutting taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, this kind of war with other races can be crowned as fighting for living space for the human race, and the force will be full in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Holy See continues to decline during the war, the Kingdom of Hesse will be able to gain greater initiative in future negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even following the example of the Alpha Kingdom and the Frankish King, it is not impossible to pay a symbolic gold coin every year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be precise, the two countries have not even cashed in a single gold coin. It's not that they don't want to give this last gold coin, but that the Holy See felt insulted and refused to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the disappearing \"tithe tax\", it was naturally spent by the local church under a clever name. Repair churches today, do charitable donations tomorrow, and start public welfare the day after tomorrow...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just an account, and the Holy See has no ability to verify it anyway. The essence of these face-saving projects is that the ruling class wants to maintain its own legal system.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It is better to stick to the city wall than to fight in the field.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please rest assured!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now it is the army of the principality who is holding the line of defense, not the cowards of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, and there will never be any escape without a fight. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins immediately promised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Eastern Warhammer Kingdom collapsed quickly, and the core factor was that the last orc invasion broke their backbone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of population losses, tens of thousands of middle and lower noble officers were killed, and the newly formed army was unqualified from officers to soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bottom is rotten, and the top is also rotten.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The great nobles who dared to fight their lives either died on the battlefield or shouldered the responsibility of defeat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The new power holders are all masters of infighting and the king of blame, so don't embarrass them when fighting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Politicians command the army to fight, and the results can be imagined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing several failures, these guys were scared out of their wits, and they didn't dare to fight **** battles with the alien allied forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the law of the Human Race Alliance, these guys would have run away long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the rotten allies, the situation of the Principality of Moxi is much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although they also suffered heavy losses in the last war, they are politically stable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The transition of power was completed smoothly, and there was no such thing as wantonly dumping the pot after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the later period of the war, they also poached corners from the Alpha Kingdom to make up for the loss of part of their military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if the situation is critical now, the senior officials of the principality can find ways to actively respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the assurance from the Minister of Military Affairs, George's face improved a lot, and he asked slowly:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"When will the reinforcements promised by the Alpha Kingdom arrive?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the current situation, being able to send reinforcements is definitely a hard-core ally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not counting the Seven Kingdoms of the Grasslands and the Counties of Korubia annexed by the Hessians, there are eleven independent sovereign states in the North Continent, but the Principality of Moxi can only count on the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to obtain reinforcements, the Mossi tried their best to sell the \"first west and then north strategy\" to the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is a pity that the Alpha people are worried about the heavy army gathering, so they also attract the firepower of the elves to themselves, and still insist on the \"first north, then west strategy\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the 100,000 troops promised by the Alpha Kingdom have been assembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marshal Hudson is training the reinforcements. It is expected that the internal running-in will be completed within a month, and we will be able to see the reinforcements as soon as next month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The specific troop configuration and marching route are still unknown.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Marshal Hudson intends to lead the team in person, so there is no need to worry too much about this. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato's answer made everyone breathe a sigh of relief.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One raging soldier, one raging litter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Trust is built on the battlefield. With Hudson, a well-known general, leading the team, other problems are not a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I am afraid to send a general similar to Caesar IV, no amount of reinforcements will be enough to prodigal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Since Marshal Hudson came here in person, let him decide how to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All departments should do a good job of cooperating, especially the logistics supply, and there must be no trouble!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long will it take for the national mobilization to be completed? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can be seen that King George is still the same George back then, and he never intervenes randomly in matters beyond his own professional capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the first batch of mobilization has been completed, and half of the second round of mobilization has been completed. The follow-up mobilization work is expected to last for three to four months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering the logistical pressure, all the officers and soldiers mobilized in the second round are currently staying in place for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The standing army plus the first batch of mobilized troops will total 380,000 troops, plus the 270,000 defeated soldiers who were incorporated into the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, and the 30,000 troops from various countries to reinforce them, the actual total strength of the frontline will reach 600,000. Eighty thousand people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Considering that every day, the broken troops of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom come to meet up, this number is still increasing, and the final total strength is likely to exceed 700,000.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the perspective of military strength, it is enough for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the current situation in the Principality of Orton is also very bad. Even if they have mobilized the whole country, coupled with the collapse of the East Warhammer Kingdom, they may not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maybe at the end of this month, or maybe next month, the Principality will inevitably fall into a two-front battle situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that time, the number of defeated allies gathered will likely exceed the number of troops we mobilized, and it will be very difficult to command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the quality of the East Warhammer Kingdom's army, I really don't know how to describe it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It feels like they all want a male soldier, and there are a lot of female soldiers mixed in.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many soldiers lost their weapons and armors. They are not so much an army as a group of refugees. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Herceg said depressedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he has greeted all those in power in the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sitting on so many troops, they collapsed so quickly. Where there was a war, it was clearly running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's okay to have too many soldiers, but pay attention to the quality anyway!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crowds, no matter how many there are, their combat effectiveness cannot be counted on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it wasn't for the fact that the enemy didn't leave any room for survival, forcing everyone to desperately fight, the battle would have ended long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all delivered to your door, and you have to accept them if you don't accept them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these soldiers are not gathered together and managed militarized in a unified manner, these people will cause harm to the place after they flood into the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bathed in the autumn wind, Hudson stepped on the dragon and looked down at the \"one hundred thousand army\" below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most eye-catching ones are naturally the five thousand monster cavalry, who are full of murderous aura just standing there. It can be seen that in order to train the wild beasts, they have worked hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Change!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by Hudson's order, the team began to operate regularly, the sound of neat steps sounded, and the ground trembled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elite army is different from the ordinary army after all, and the overall quality gap is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even ordinary soldiers can read and write. It's not that everyone loves to study, the main cultivation is a delicate job.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to cultivating talent, one also needs to have a certain knowledge reserve. Otherwise, even if you embark on the road of cultivation, you can only stop at the low level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kind of person who picks up a cheat book and becomes a top master in the mainland, Hudson has only seen it in the wandering poet's book.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the practice methods in the continent of Aslante are similar with minor differences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magician absorbs magic power, tempers spiritual power, and practice method-meditation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Knight training is to exercise physical fitness and temper combat experience in the early stage, and improve life seeds in the later stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are indeed some special cultivation methods, but most of them have restrictions and are full of uncertainties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Like Hudson himself, he took the popular route and practiced the most widely spread exercises on the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children of the great nobles in the kingdom are basically taking this route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the route is the same, but in fact, there are subtle differences in each person's way of walking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This change varies from person to person and can only be explored by yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially after entering the eighth level, even a reckless man will gradually become a scholar. It has nothing to do with personal interests and hobbies. The main reason is that comprehension of laws requires a very high knowledge reserve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If self-knowledge is not enough, even if you are lucky enough to comprehend it, you will not be able to digest it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Pius VII started, the sanctuary powerhouses on the mainland have sprung up like mushrooms after a spring rain, constantly popping out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A warhammer master appeared in the dwarf kingdom. The previous king of the stone people who should have died also came out as a sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most powerful ones are the elves. The queens of the three major elf kingdoms are actually strong in the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson was not surprised. With the lifespan of the elves, it is not surprising that there are several sanctuary powerhouses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three queens of the elves are not the new elves of this era. They all came to the throne two or three hundred years ago, and they might have been in the sanctuary hundreds of years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Choose to expose strength at this time, naturally to cheer up the alien alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wars in many places have reached a stalemate. It seems that the two sides are evenly matched. In fact, there are obviously more areas where the human race has the advantage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In other words, except for the Northern Continent, all battlefields are dominated by the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, there was no movement on the human race side. Except for Pius VII who took the lead, no one has ever heard of anyone breaking through the realm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson doesn't know whether it is because everyone is saving face for the Pope and temporarily leaving the stage for Pius VII to perform; or whether it is true that no one has broken through the sanctuary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no one in the Alpha Kingdom has recently broken through the sanctuary, and there are quite a few people seeking breakthroughs in retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In short, on the surface, there were seven sanctuary powerhouses in the alien camp, and the original five were still on the human side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the advantages, whether it is the Pope holding the artifact suit, or the four dragon knights in the mainland, they are not comparable to ordinary sanctuaries, and Hudson has an extra bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foreign race also has a racial inheritance artifact in their hands. It is not known who is strong and who is weak before they have fought. The two sides are considered to be in a state of balance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, judging from the data, it can be inferred that the number of sanctuary powerhouses on the mainland is still very small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the very least, the Orc Empire and the Alliance of Ancient Remnants did not introduce any figures to support their appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the Beastman Empire, if there is such a strong man, it should be launched to inspire the spirit of the beast.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, in terms of the current continental war, it is far more valuable for such a few sanctuary powerhouses to stay at home as spiritual leaders than to send them out for actual combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is true that the shots are made every now and then, there will soon be a scene of the strong man in the sanctuary being chased and killed by a group of eighth-level masters.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially on the battlefield, if you accidentally fall into the trap set by the enemy, even the strongest in the sanctuary may fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the Principality of Moxi sent the latest battle report. The foreign army has launched a full-scale attack on the front line of Fort Augustus. The king invites you to go to the palace to discuss matters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orderly's words rang in his ears, and Hudson frowned slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coalition forces of the ancient survivors invaded the Principality of Moxi, and it was clear that they did not take the Alpha Kingdom seriously, and the war on the Western Front was inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he thought that if the Alliance of the Ancient Remained Clans gave them face and went south directly from the Principality of Orton, he would lead the army to find the bad luck of the orcs first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom that has already fallen, and the Western Warhammer Kingdom that is about to fall, it might as well leave them to them for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that these guys didn't cooperate and insisted on forcing him to support the Moxi battlefield first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marquis James, you continue to watch the training here, I will go to the palace first.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson immediately gave instructions to the deputy commander on the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to learn from a teacher, James Marquis directly became a follower. Wherever Hudson personally trains, there must be this deputy coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unprepared, mainly in the eyes of Hudson, this person is not a threat at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made him tied to the royal family too much, and owed too much to the royal family in the process of rising?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't repay the debt of favor, you can only work for the royal family for the rest of your life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to obtain a large fief and become a prince, you don't even have to think about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't be your own masters, no matter how much you learn, you will inevitably be bound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether you can use your talents or not depends entirely on whether the monarch trusts you. But the trust of the monarch is often the most unreliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is also the life that many nobles envy. Without the support of the royal family, maybe Marquis James is still fighting for a barony.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rather than struggling among the minor nobles, it is better to become a retainer of the royal family. Not only do they have status, prosperity and wealth, but they have also accumulated enough resources for the next generation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency Marshal, judging from the current situation, your time to dispatch troops will be advanced.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Caesar IV handed the letter in his hand to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the king can't stand the power of the wind beside his pillow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that Caesar IV's right to speak in the military is limited, so there is no problem in helping to speak, but it is still a little bit short of making a direct decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order not to cause political turmoil, Hudson was simply invited to talk alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Familiar notes, familiar words, it is written by old friend George at first glance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar letters have also been received by Hudson before this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the content of this letter from home is different. In addition to asking for help, it also hints in a cryptic tone: Hurry up to send troops for reinforcements, and the terms are negotiable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This wave of profit buying is not aimed at the Alpha Kingdom, but at individuals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the price to be paid to buy a kingdom is far greater than the price to be paid to buy one or two people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the reaction of Caesar IV, it is obvious that he accepted the goodwill of the Mosi people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, do you want to discuss this matter with everyone?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked tentatively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is still not used to discussing interests directly with the Moxi people in front of his boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the guess is wrong, this is the hole that Caesar IV dug specially for him, and he would be an idiot if he jumped into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, if some things are made public, it will be difficult!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV frowned slightly and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he didn't want to intervene so directly, but he couldn't stand his queen nagging in his ear every day, and his brother-in-law was generous enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, sooner or later, troops will be dispatched. A few days earlier, the impact on the Alpha Kingdom is not too great, so they simply agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a slight hesitation, Hudson nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really not suitable for too many people to know about this kind of thing, otherwise the cake will not be enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he couldn't help but lament George's rapid growth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just sending reinforcements in advance is not worth such a big price. It seems to be just to let the reinforcements go out quickly, but in fact they want to change the strategy of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the war goes well, that's all. Once it is frustrated, the strategy of the Alpha Kingdom will change from \"first north, then west\" to \"first west, then north\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the strategic change of the kingdom, even if Hudson is bold, he will inevitably make a murmur.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Principality of Moxi just bought him alone, Hudson would definitely refuse without hesitation. After all, the promises of politicians are the most unreliable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one can guarantee whether the Moxi people will sell him at a critical moment for profit in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pulling Caesar IV into the water together, the situation will be different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If one person cannot carry the pot, if two people carry it, the pressure will be much lighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the secret is revealed, the king will be the first to stand in front. If you are in a hurry, guide the public opinion, so that the outside world thinks that Caesar IV ordered him to do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The character design of \"loyal minister\" can also restore a lot of reputation, so as not to bear the infamy of \"traitor\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for Caesar IV, there is no need to worry about it at all. It is the norm in the continent of Aslant to help relatives but not to help. At most, it was a wrong decision, and no one would think that he, the boss, betrayed the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, there are still three provinces whose royal families lead to the north. No matter how high the Moxi bid, it was impossible for him to compensate the three provinces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, this is only the opinion of the middle and small nobles. The nobles knew that the royal family did not invest much resources in the three northern provinces, and even if they lost it, the loss would not be great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From this point of view, it is not bad that the monarch's ability is mediocre. If a hero is changed and a large amount of resources are spent in the three northern provinces, they will definitely not be able to afford the loss now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this transaction, in addition to the benefits directly obtained, there are also hidden political interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the friendship of sharing the spoils together, the delicate relationship between Hudson and Caesar IV will also change accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The easing of the relationship between the two is of great significance to the political stability of the post-war kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Brain made up a series of content, looking at Caesar IV in front of him, Hudson was very suspicious whether his own king had noticed these problems.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, he had quite a lot to think about. Even George, who planned this operation, didn't necessarily think so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After cleaning up the redundant thoughts, Hudson began to think carefully about what he should ask the Moxi people for in return.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The risk must be proportional to the benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is not sure whether this rescue operation can quickly and severely injure the coalition forces of the ancient survivors and force them to change their strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the plan can be completed, all the benefits given by the Moxi people are pure profits, and there will be no hidden dangers. Naturally, everyone is happy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the established plan is not completed and the kingdom's strategy needs to be adjusted, Hudson will have to do more work and bear corresponding political risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After thinking about it for a while, Hudson found out in embarrassment that it seemed that the Principality of Moxi had been searched by him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of ancient books and secrets, all kinds of materials and knowledge, it cannot be said that he got all of them, at least he has a copy of what the Moxi people are willing to trade.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the secrets are mostly owned by the Principality of Moxi, and they don't hang around there. Even if they get it, it doesn't mean much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Enclave, not interested; magic weapons and equipment, with his current status, he can get them in the kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only thing worth thinking about is those refugees. Even if the conditions are not accepted, Hudson can still get it, but it is difficult to guarantee the number without official cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, no matter what you want, you can't ask for money. Master Hudson, who has just sold a large amount of potions, now the most important thing is money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And this is a long-term transaction. As long as everyone wants to develop the Warcraft Legion, they will not worry about no business. There are potential buyers everywhere in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wanting to bribe him with money is blaspheming the honor of the nobility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the war has progressed to the present, and there have been a large number of refugees from the East and West Warhammer Kingdoms and the Principality of Orton pouring into the Principality of Mosi. They may not be able to resettle them all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As allies, we should also do our part to help them relieve some of the pressure. This requires the royal family to set an example! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson tried again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for a few provinces in the north, the population density of the Mountain Territory is the lowest in the Kingdom Plain. On average, there are less than ten people per square kilometer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With such a small population, it is difficult to do anything. For the development of the territory, it is worth taking a risk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, since he took the position of coach, he has been on the gambling table. Even if Hudson wanted to go on, the nobles of the kingdom who bet behind him would not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It is the kingdom's duty to help its allies. After the war, the royal family will receive some of the broken troops that are beyond the capacity of the Principality of Moxi and arrange them properly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the marshal has spare energy, he might as well do the same.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard from George that they had gathered nearly 300,000 broken soldiers. Once the Principality of Orton collapses, this number will increase significantly, and may even double directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you add the possible routs of the North Continent in the future, the number of routs that will eventually flow into the Principality of Moxi will eventually be an extremely terrifying number. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV said without changing his face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A defeated soldier is also a soldier, and it was not an easy task to survive from the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gathering these guys can indeed increase military strength, but it is really troublesome to arrange them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the current development of the situation, the Principality of Moxi, located in the center of the Northern Continent, is a natural large \"military camp\" that gathers defeated soldiers from all over the world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, it's okay to be defeated. The mountain leaders are sparsely populated. They can gather some refugees and solve the shortage of labor in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    800,000 is not too little, and 1.5 million is not too much. Specifically, according to the actual situation, it depends on how many refugees in the Principality of Moxi cannot be resettled, and we need our help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as people are sent over, I will not refuse anyone. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson made an offer unceremoniously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not necessary to fight for the defeated soldiers, he is not interested in that little force. If the royal family wants it, just give it to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are high-quality rout soldiers, they will be recruited on the battlefield. The quality that can be left to the end is not much higher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that they are physically stronger than refugees, and they have more strength to work. With a little training, they can be used as an army, but these guys are not easy to manage!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"No problem, I think George will be grateful to the Marshal after receiving this news.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Caesar IV readily agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Be able to be generous with the generosity of others and buy people's hearts for yourself. Even if it's his brother-in-law who is generous, he doesn't care.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees, as long as the North Continent is chaotic enough, there will be no refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Haggling was saved, Hudson was very annoyed. If I had known it would be so smooth, I would have simply quoted 1.5 million. Why bother to give a range?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all people of status, and even his own king gives face like this, so he can't show petty air.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on his contacts in the Principality of Moxi, it is estimated that it is impossible for the other party to give according to the minimum standard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the performance on the battlefield is a bit sharper, it is hopeful to get 1.5 million refugees from Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, please tell Grand Duke George. The initial training of the reinforcements has been completed, and the rest of the training can be carried out on the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After five days at the latest, the army will set off. The reinforcements are all cavalry, and the marching speed is relatively fast, and they must enter the Principality of Moxi before the end of the month! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

There is a military conflict between the Principality of Kantruo in the west and the elves, and the war is imminent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The request for help has already flown to the Kingdom of Alpha. The Kingdom has not held a meeting to discuss this issue, obviously it is not going to send reinforcements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It can only be blamed for the bad luck of the Principality of Kantruo, which is too far away from the Lord of Dawn and too close to the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pain is temporary. If the elves make a move, it will be thunderous. This kind of trouble should disappear soon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When there is bad news, there is good news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Frankish stepped up its offensive against the Orc Kingdom, and once again pushed the front line forward by a hundred miles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Holy See has also started to erupt recently, perhaps because it is preparing to vent its grievances at sea on land, and the dwarves are having a hard time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The land previously occupied by the Kingdom of Ruthenia has been forced to spit it out, and the flames of war have reached the mainland of the Dwarf Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cannibal tribe has been struggling recently, and the Kingdom of Iribia's offensive has become more and more fierce. If it weren't for the geographical advantage, they might have collapsed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the contrary, the battle situation in the Central Continent is at a stalemate. The Kingdom of Hesse is fighting happily with the Stone People, the Kingdom of Dante is fighting with the Trolls, and the Kingdom of the South Bank is fighting for positions with the Three-Eyed Race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can see that the strength of the human race is stronger the farther to the south, and the strength of the foreign race is relatively weaker. The situation is just the opposite when going north.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In general, the two sides are evenly matched, and the human race seems to have a slight advantage because it is a single race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is mainly racial conflicts, which suppress the contradictions within the human race. Otherwise, various regional blacks, regional conflicts, ethnic groups...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a brief glance, Hudson nodded and said:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"I know the situation. Distribute this \"Long-distance Training Plan\" to all regiments of the expeditionary army, and send a copy to the Ministry of Military Affairs by the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the logistics department to prepare supplies, and the army will leave tomorrow. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the interests are in place, everything is easy to discuss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately sending troops to rescue is too abrupt, but in the name of training, it is still possible to move the troops towards the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wait until the army moves to the border area, when to fight over, that is Hudson's own decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appearance of a warplane is enough to shut everyone's mouths.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a little disturbance, Caesar IV will help to deal with the aftermath. The benefits are shared by everyone, and there is no reason for him to do the work alone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, Marshal!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walls replied hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing speaking, he immediately picked up the \"Long-distance Training Plan\" on the desk, turned around and went to implement it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After following along for a few months, he already has a general understanding of Hudson's style.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The requirement for \"efficiency\" can be called abnormal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Hudson took office as the commander-in-chief of the Kingdom Army, not only the efficiency within the army has been greatly improved, but even the efficiency of various government departments has been forced to improve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the order is issued, overtime must be completed. If you dare to procrastinate, pack your things and go home!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter how big the backstage is. If you dare to make a fuss, you don't even have to go home. You can go directly to the “Warrior Camp” to report.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mobilization of the \"100,000 troops\" was ordered today to be dispatched tomorrow, which was impossible in the past.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that the army can't do it, it's mainly because the logistics can't keep up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everything is different, after Hudson made reforms in the army, the officers also learned to live ascetics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the supplies are not available in a short period of time, they will eat dry food directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are opinions to hold back, and Marshal Hudson himself can take the lead in eating dry food, so it is hard for everyone to say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everything is preparing for the long-distance raid. The current hard training is just to let everyone get used to it in advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the name of the ancients will travel thousands of miles, and the biggest problem will always be logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson chose the Principality of Moxi as the battlefield, in fact, he also considered logistics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the noble castles along the way are not all fallen, they can provide supplies for the army. Even a full meal or two is crucial in war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the war starts, the food problem is secondary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After winning the battle, all kinds of livestock that died in the battle are our rations. The various materials looted are the best supplements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you lose, don't worry. The long-distance raid failed, even if the entire army was not wiped out, few soldiers survived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The tense situation in the grassland soon spread to the Alpha Kingdom. A large number of refugees are waiting for the kingdom to receive them, but at this time the fleet has lost its chain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by the ghost ship. With the record of destroying the Holy See fleet, the names of Hudson's three ghost ships resounded throughout the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is affectionately called by everyone - \"Three Kings of the Netherworld\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in coastal areas, the names of the Three Nether Kings can make children cry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To carry out transportation under their noses, if the heart is not strong enough, it will make people collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do not dare to go by sea, and evacuate by land, both in terms of efficiency and death rate have risen sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps realizing that the human race wanted to evacuate, the orc empire continued to send out cavalry to hunt refugees on the prairie.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are exceptions to everything, other people's fleets dare not move, and the mountain leaders still transport with great fanfare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the panic will spread. After two transportations, the hired fleet quit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, it's not about money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main reason is that the sailors are afraid. I have exhausted my words, but they still refuse to board the ship. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Captain Gull said in embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous transportation task could not be completed on time, and the mountain leader had already postponed them once. Now that he came here to sell miserably again, he himself was ashamed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unfortunately, the people under his command didn't give face. After two trips, he no longer wanted to take this route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Gul, didn't the first two times go well?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the recent period, they have not heard the news of the ghost ship. Presumably, they were also severely damaged during the battle with the Holy See fleet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can act with confidence and boldness, so there is nothing to worry about! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose pretended to be calm and persuaded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He has used it many times for a similar reason, but the effect is not as good as once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Mr. Jose, it's not that I, Guer, don't give you face, it's because the mission can't go on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time we came back from Xingang, the ships along the way were almost extinct, and everyone gave up this route.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of safety, we sail close to the coastline, but everyone is still afraid!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the ghost ship comes out of the sea of ​​mist, our fleet will only be wiped out. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gul said with a sad face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people below are afraid, so is he, the owner of the ship!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the property is on it, once something goes wrong, it will all be over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In an instant, Jose realized that someone was deliberately releasing panic to attack the maritime trade of the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many suspects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It may be done by the Holy See, or it may be done by the Kingdom of Hesse, or it may be...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Captain Gul, don't worry, we still have a solution to this problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Turning around, I will let the Griffin Dragoons in the territory stare at the misty sea area, and I will notify you immediately if there is any movement, absolutely not...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Jose could finish his countermeasures, Gul interrupted:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, the sea of ​​mist is so vast, how can you stare at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, even if the Griffin Dragon finds the ghost ship, it may not be able to send the information back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent days, several mercenary groups have entered the misty sea area to explore, and they are gone forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I heard that a few days ago, the Dalton family sent griffin cavalry to monitor the misty sea area, and they also broke into it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are too many lessons learned from the past, and there is really no need to continue taking risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If something goes wrong, the earl will pursue it, and you will not end well! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this explanation, Jose was also silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mercenary ships that explored deep into the misty sea were all tired of living and looking for death, but the air force monitoring the misty sea also had an accident, so there was a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least it can prove that the three ghost ships in the misty sea area can move freely, not just stay inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How about this!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since everyone's fleet has stopped these days, Captain Gul will help to be a middleman and invite all major ship owners.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone is idle, why don't you come over and help us transport it first, and then ask the Earl to **** you all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all defeated by the master, you can rest assured now, right? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose said cruelly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In any case, the share of immigrants allocated to the territory must be transported back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the emphasis placed on the population by the lord, it is normal to transport tens of thousands of immigrants at one time, and **** them in person.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The prestige is all earned. Hudson has a record of repelling three ghost ships, and Gul's hanging heart suddenly fell. Then he asked with concern:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Mr. Jose, the count is busy with the kingdom's military affairs, do you have time to delay?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the most realistic problem. The nobles along the coast are suffering from blocked routes, and Hudson was not invited to take action. The most critical factor is that the threat of alien races is greater than that of ghost ships.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No matter how rampant the ghost ship is, it is just making noise at sea, and cannot shake the foundation of everyone, but the alien race is here to destroy the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Don't worry, ghosts also have a lot of wisdom. Even if the earl doesn't have time to guard us, he can still negotiate with the ghost king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mountain Territory lacks population, you are worried about the threat of ghost ships, and we are also worried about immigration accidents!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if they can't prevent them from plundering the Quartet, at least they can make the Ghost King agree not to touch our ship. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose tried his best to fool him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether the problem can be resolved through negotiation, he has no idea at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the matter of the ghost ship is highly confidential, and only Hudson knows it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important thing now is to fool the fleet and bring the immigrants back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If an accident occurs, it will be the \"Three Kings of the Netherworld\" breach of contract, and there is no way to verify it anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I want to return to my thoughts, but the matter still needs to be reported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the plan, after resettling the immigrants, he will go to the Principality of Moxi with the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not only to use his military ability, but also to reward him for his past achievements.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the Kingdom of Alpha, if a commoner wants to become an aristocrat, he cannot do without military merit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose was a nobleman before, but because he was made a scapegoat and became a commoner, it will only be more difficult to become a nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough outstanding achievements, it is impossible to obtain the title of knighthood by blocking the mouths of the victims.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is said that others need one military merit to become a nobleman, then Jose needs ten military merits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not easy to take the blame.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crown Prince Caesar became the king back then, and no matter how much everyone had resentment, they could only hold back, and the blame all fell on Jose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This almost cut off his way of self-reliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Hudson can also help him block these hidden dark swords. If you go out and start your own business independently, you don't know how you will die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The letter reached Hudson, and the army has already set off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In name, it was a pull-up training, and anyone with common sense of geography would know that it was a preparation for sending troops to the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is also leading troops to fight, and the command of elite troops is indeed much smoother.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it is the speed of marching or the formation of the army, it is not comparable to any army that Hudson has led before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recalling the previous tens of thousands of cavalry regiments, it looks like **** now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can only bully the cannon fodder of the orcs, let alone the cavalry, the gap is completely different.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Basically, Hudson didn't worry about anything along the way. Even if he encountered a problem, the officers below would find a way to solve it by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there is a big trouble, it is reported together with the trouble and the solution, waiting for his approval from the boss.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are not many affairs in the army, so Hudson has the leisure to consider the affairs in the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Regarding the issue of the ghost ship, he admitted that he did not explain it in detail enough, which made his subordinates misunderstand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, this kind of thing cannot be brought to the table.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, he still had a headache, how to solve the problem of the ghost ship, but he didn't expect his subordinates to help him think of a solution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Negotiation\" Okay, the compromise between the human race and the aliens is not once or twice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The legendary ancient heroes can all negotiate with evil gods. In contrast, negotiating with ghost ships can only be regarded as pediatrics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of \"Three Nether Kings\" is indeed a bit fierce, but his popularity is not low.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is reasonable for the two sanctuaries, one dragon and one bear, to suppress the three kings of the underworld. Even if everyone has doubts, they will only think that the hidden power of the Alpha Kingdom is involved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thanks to the publicity of the Holy See outside, everyone believed that the three ghost ships were at the sanctuary level, and no one would have thought that the strong at this level could be enslaved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, things did not end so easily. Once the ships in the mountain territory could pass freely, the nobles in the coastal areas of the kingdom would definitely come to ask for help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maritime trade is such a big piece of cake, no one will give up easily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eating alone\" is \"eating poison\". Such a big cake cannot be swallowed by Hudson alone. Compromise is the inevitable result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you ask for benefits, obviously you can only do it according to the needs of the ghost ship, otherwise things will go wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, being a middleman can't be done in vain. It's just that this kind of return depends on everyone's self-consciousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the ghost ship is not a giant dragon. If it is a giant dragon blocking the road and robbing, you can just collect the protection fee directly, and no one will doubt it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This trip is destined to be indispensable, even if it's just for show, the cutscene must be completed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

With the lessons learned from the Holy See, no one dared to send the fleet in to give away their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone's general understanding: Only with the cooperation of several sanctuary powerhouses can it be possible to destroy the Nether Ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is too difficult to do this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are only so few sanctuary powerhouses on the surface of the human race, and they belong to different forces.

The opponent is a strong player at the same level, if one is accidentally lost, who will bear the responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The battle lasted for several hours, and Howell hurriedly passed back the information he knew without caring about determining the identity of the shooter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the evening, after the play, Hudson walked out of the sea of ​​mist with a dragon and a bear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to attract the attention of the spies, Hudson made Maxim yell. The sound of the dragon chant breaking through the sky seemed to announce the return of the king.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beida City, Governor's Mansion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the information in his hand, Earl Pierce frowned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dragon Knights took a shot at the ghost ship, on the surface, this must be a good thing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the dragon knight is not a fool. He ran to fight the ghost ship for no reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Do you think it was Hudson who made the shot?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce asked slightly hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that he made a fuss, the main reason is that although Hudson is a member of the great coastal aristocracy, the interests of the Koslow family in the sea are minimal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without enough benefits, running to fight the ghost ship is not logical no matter how you look at it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, the two sides had fought once a few months ago. At that time, there was no ghost ship left, and the battlefield was changed to the foggy sea area, which was even more hopeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Master, if the Earl of Hudson made the move, it might have something to do with the refugees being transported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mountain Territories are short of labor, and the airlines have been interrupted recently, blocking their access to refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you change to land, you will not only have to travel through the vast prairie, but also face the threat of the orc army that appears at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Refugees assigned to the Koslow family, one-fifth of them can reach the destination alive, and they are all blessed by the Lord of Dawn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of these refugees is more than one-third of the total population of the Mountain Territory. It is also possible that the Earl of Hudson personally took action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the battlefield is too special, our people can't get close, and we don't know how the battle is going. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old butler Gadri analyzed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a potential competitor, knowing each other is just basic homework.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Relying on the resource support secretly provided by the Dalton family, they got up early and planted the spies in the past, and made contributions smoothly, and many of them mixed into the middle and high levels of the mountain territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, any big move of the Koslow family cannot escape their eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, Hudson is well aware of all this. There was no major purge, mainly because these spies were too capable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They can do what other people can't do; they can do more beautifully what other people can do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, when purchasing grain, the people on their own can only buy 2,000 tons when they go out; if they arrange these spies to go out, they can buy back 2,500 tons, and the price can be a little cheaper.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The wool delivered to the door, if you don't masturbate, you won't **** for nothing. If you **** more times, you will gradually become addicted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Marginalized these guys several times, and finally they returned to the center of power with credit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If he hadn't experienced information bombing and noticed something was wrong in advance, Hudson would have regarded them as \"ministers of the humerus\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The battle situation is very obvious. Marshal Hudson was able to retreat unscathed, so he shouldn't suffer too much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the Three Nether Kings are not easy to provoke. Even if the strong fight against each other, they will not lose if the geographical advantage is not obvious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The five sanctuaries fought for several hours, and then stayed for more than two hours before they came out. Most likely they were negotiating with the Three Nether Kings.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next, look at the actions of the Mountain Territory. If their ships can operate normally, it proves that the two sides have reached a compromise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If we can compromise, it will be a good thing for us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earl can unite several great nobles in the coastal area to come forward and invite one of Marshal Hudson to negotiate with the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sanctuary-level ghost ship is no longer at the same level as the ordinary ghost ship. Simply looting and killing around is not of great help to the ghost king. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Schaefer said with confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Athlant Continent is a place where strength speaks for itself after all. When encountering weak heretics, it is natural to kill them, but when encountering powerful aliens, compromise is still necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Political flexibility is an essential element for a qualified nobleman.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"We can't wait any longer, every day the shipping is interrupted, the family will suffer tens of thousands of losses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone to contact each family now. The housekeeper prepared a generous gift, which should be useful in the future. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Governor Pierce made a decisive decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no way ahead, no matter how big the loss is, the Dalton family can only bear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that I see the hope of solving the problem, I naturally have to find a way to solve it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the sea trade stopped, the goods of the Dalton family have been backlogged, and the prosperous port has become depressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The family's business loses money every day, and the family's fleet has to be maintained. It was supposed to be the most profitable industry, but now it has become a gold-swallowing behemoth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If this situation continues, the small and medium-sized maritime merchants, shipowners, sailors, and dock workers who depend on them for a living will inevitably go bankrupt.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once these people leave, it is not so simple to start the trade again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Essentially, this is an industrial chain. The Dalton family only occupies the most profitable part of it, and the middle and lower reaches must be completed by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is impossible for one family to finish all the business.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The indirect loss is even greater. It can be said that the economy of the entire southeastern province will inevitably be affected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the play was over, the fleet that stayed at Bear Harbor early the next morning went out to sea flying the flag of the Koslow family.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The news has spread in the mountain area, and everyone knows that Master Hudson and the ghost ship broke out in a battle, and they fought for the right of free navigation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the dragon and bear flag fluttering in the wind, everyone couldn't help showing awe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this is the second time Hudson has modified the family flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original flag of the Koslow family was a war horse, symbolizing the spirit of bravery.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar family flags, there are not five hundred but three hundred in the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if there are differences in details, it is easy to make mistakes when distinguishing them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These are minor problems. The little nobles are not well-known, so they can be identified mainly by the characters on the flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that these families are lazy and don't know how to design a highly recognizable flag, but the flags of noble families also have unspoken rules.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is a dragon on the family flag, it means that the ancestors have produced dragon knights; if there is a sacred logo, it means that the ancestors have produced saints...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it simply, the family flag can only be awesome if the ancestors were awesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to change the flag, you can only be awesome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the conditions are not met, forcing one's own family flag to have a special meaning will only provoke ridicule.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under this system of rules, one can know what kind of treatment should be given by looking at what is on the other party's family flag.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that the family banner is awesome, and the family strength is definitely not bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if it is a declining ancient nobleman, if he can keep his family inheritance from being snatched away by others, his own strength is not much weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Jacob, the Department of State is going to be a little more careful while I'm gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If several nobles along the coast come to visit, hand over this material list and the contract to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tell them that everything on this is what the ghost ship wants. If you want to navigate freely, you can gather the above materials and send them over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If they are not willing to accept the terms, or if they feel that the price of the ghost ship is higher, let them negotiate by themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to worry about the rest. No matter what everyone says, don't agree. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For this expedition, most of the family's private troops stayed in the territory, and only brought the demonic beast cavalry from the territory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Warcraft cavalry in the entire kingdom have been recruited, and Hudson will naturally not specialize. As for the remaining elites, of course they are gone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best soldiers, if they join the Warcraft Cavalry Regiment, or become officers in the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It has only been a few years since I made a fortune, and it is not easy to own this family fortune. The families that can produce thousands of extraordinary elites are all veteran nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson has a lot of ordinary elite soldiers, but they are not needed in this war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of troops remained in the territory, which made him feel at ease. Even if you encounter an emergency, you can handle it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actions against the Holy See are indeed secretive, but it doesn't mean that people won't vent their anger. It is impossible to kill them directly, but it is entirely possible to support cult organizations to do things.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past month, there have been three cult rebellions in the southeast province alone. It's just that these guys' performance was a little hip, and they were suppressed as soon as they rebelled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The largest rebellion only occupied a barony, and before it had time to expand, it was surrounded and beaten by neighbors to the point of doubting its life.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the poor performance of the cult organization itself, the main reason is that they have too few believers and not many people respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even so, Hudson still dare not take it lightly. Under normal circumstances, cult organizations can't make waves, but there are still abnormal times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once an all-out war breaks out, the lives of ordinary people will definitely be affected, and a breeding ground for cults will appear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, the armed forces of the local nobles were concentrated on the front line, and they were unable to continue to suppress them, which could easily lead to chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, by taking action to help the major nobles along the coast, they are actually helping themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These guys have money in their pockets, so the kingdom has money to continue the war. It is not necessary to exploit places desperately in order to raise war funds.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the shortage of food, they also need to vigorously develop marine fisheries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the supply of materials is up, the rations of the people at the bottom will not be cut. Only when life goes on can the cult be suppressed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In contrast, what the ghosts want is not worth mentioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All the materials on the list, Hudson has known. It can be regarded as precious, but it is not hard to find.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as everyone is willing to contribute, it is not difficult to gather the above materials.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you still can't do it, it's a matter of sincerity. When you hit the south wall, you will naturally turn around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Lord Earl!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jacob replied helplessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Military issues, he has cleared nine out of ten senses, and he really can't get through the remaining one. Now watching everyone go to the battlefield, I stay and guard the house.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson could only pretend not to see this scene. Bringing the team to the front line, the second is to make military achievements, the main reason is to broaden their horizons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the continuous development of the territory, Hudson is convinced that he needs more talents who can be independent. Digging the wall is too difficult, so you can only cultivate it yourself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you really use soldiers to fight, in fact, generals are more reliable. Civil servants are as rich in theory as they are in actual combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The number of great talents who are capable of both civil and military skills and who can be promoted to the prime minister is really too small.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not extravagant to hope to have all of them, but in the turbulent Aslante continent, if you want to sit on one side, you still need some military capabilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Had a little bit of military talent, Hudson didn't mind bringing it along to train him. If you don't have any talent at all, then there is really no way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After arranging the affairs of the territory, Hudson led a few team members, summoned Maxim and went straight to the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fort Augustus, once an important strategic location of the Principality of Mosi, has once again become a battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the attack of the foreign coalition forces, the defenders were extremely tenacious, but they still couldn't reverse the decline on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Viscount Raquel, who was pushed to the fore by the times, is also about to cry at this moment. I don't know who slandered the king, saying that he got Hudson's true biography.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With great power comes great responsibility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The heavy responsibility of guarding Fort Augustus fell directly on his shoulders. Even if he wants to shirk, who gave him the experience of guarding the Flying Bear's Fort?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the Fort of Flying Bear was lost at the last moment, the fierce offensive and defensive battle of Fort Flying Bear made the high-level officials of the Principality satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the loser, he certainly has no military merits, but the Principality did not pursue the responsibility of losing the city and land!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The principality's high-level officials replicated the offensive and defensive battle of Flying Bear's Fort that year, and used the defense line of Fort Augustus to consume the strength of the foreign coalition forces to buy more time for the principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ideals are beautiful, but the reality is indeed the backbone. Raquel did learn a lot from Hudson, but it doesn't mean that the dude has become a famous player in the mainland.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Apart from learning how to fortify the city by strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, and strictly restraining military discipline, Raquel doesn't know what to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no counterattack. Master Hudson only leads him to fight against the wind. He has never been mixed with the headwind, but what he is facing now is the headwind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Faced with the pressure of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, Raquel can only rely on the 80,000 principality defenders and the 120,000 defeated soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The idiots of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom haven't settled down yet?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Raquel couldn't help but rubbed his forehead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meeting pig teammates is really a headache. However, the defeated soldiers came from many countries in the Northern Continent, and there was too much trouble behind it, so heavy codes could not be used at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Scolding the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom is actually a persimmon. It's all for the sake of forming a government-in-exile, so it doesn't hurt to offend them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of other countries are different, and there are people behind them. Raquel is also worried that due to his operational mistakes, the tension between the countries of the northern continent will be triggered, which will lead to unpredictable consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Excellency, please rest assured. We have already sent those idiots away from the front line, and now only middle- and lower-level officers and soldiers remain on the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that everyone's resistance is a bit strong, and they are worried that we will use them as cannon fodder and not be active when executing orders. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clinn replied hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When you meet a pig teammate, sending them away is also a good choice, at least you won't continue to cause trouble for them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Raquel even suspected that those guys who jumped out to make trouble were doing it on purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Back then, when he was a dude, in order to evade military service, he also did a lot of flirting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that the method is still too immature. I haven't played with all the old foxes in the capital, and finally went to the front line obediently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only advantage of tossing around is that I happened to meet Hudson. If there were no accidents in the middle, they would have been able to lie down and win to the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is in a different position, and if he is an exiled high-level executive of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom, he will not stay on the front line at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But abandoning the army and leaving alone would really hurt the reputation of the nobility too much, and it would be impossible to get involved in the circle if it spread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It makes perfect sense in theory to use the hands of allies to send them away deliberately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send down the order to break up all the gathered routs and reorganize them into twelve armies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Notify the nobles of the ranks of Baron and above in the defeated army to come to a meeting. After the meeting, I will re-arrange their military positions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send someone from the supervising team to watch over, and anyone who dares to sabotage will be killed without mercy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said fiercely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big nobles were all sent away, and the rest were small fish. Whether it is the influence in the noble circle or the prestige in the army, it is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that the group of \"shrimps\" has no leader, they can't make big waves in the army, so Raquel is not so easy to talk about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

It can be used to defend the city, but it can be used for other combat tasks. I am afraid that it will collapse as soon as it leaves the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send the order, the magic crystal cannon will aim at the enemy camp and fire!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laquer sighed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With insufficient strength, he couldn't take advantage of the opponent's unstable foothold to launch a surprise attack, so he could only rely on the magic crystal cannon to give the opponent a blow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter how effective it is, the key is to embolden your own people. Judging from the reactions of the soldiers on the city wall, it was clear that some people's legs were trembling before the enemy attacked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roaring cannons kicked off the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The flying shells and the mud splashed after the explosion sprayed the face of the giant general, which angered the general.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 18-meter-high behemoth swung a boulder with a diameter of 1.5 meters and threw it towards the city wall, roaring: \"Counterattack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The giants in the team got busy one after another. Some people lifted boulders, some uprooted big trees... directly greeted the city wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A boulder fell from the sky and hit the three defenders directly, creating a puddle of flesh in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if awakening the memory of panic in their bones, many defenders dropped their weapons directly and wanted to escape from the battlefield. Raquel was so angry that he pulled out his knight sword on the spot and killed two deserters himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The supervising team also took action one after another, relying on the heads hanging on the tower to stop the farce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn't say anything, but Raquel was shocked deep in his heart. It is no wonder that the Warhammer Kingdom of the East will collapse so quickly if it does not fall behind in the battle against magic technology with flesh and blood.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number of giants increases, I am afraid that the pattern of the continent of Aslant will change accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As far as he knows, these hunks of more than ten meters in front of him can only be regarded as average among the giants.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the information collected by the Principality, the largest giant currently appearing on the battlefield is more than 30 meters in size.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A player of this level appears on the battlefield, that is a proper killer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"As expected of a race that can fight against giant dragons!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel couldn't help sighing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This statement is exaggerated. Giants that can fight against dragons do exist, but they are legendary Titans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The height of fifty or sixty meters is casual, and the body of Niucha can even exceed a hundred meters. These big perverts are players of the same level as Julong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems to be cursed, the powerful Titan family has been extinct as early as ancient times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining blood is passed down among the giants. Occasionally, if luck comes, they may be able to awaken a wave, but this is all short-lived.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the human race, ordinary giants are still powerful, but their numbers make them withdraw from the mainland stage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the decline of the Warhammer Kingdom, the giant family, which had recuperated for hundreds of years, and whose territorial resources could no longer meet the needs of the race's development, came back together with a group of ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Katum, calm down, don't forget our mission!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The octopus scolded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holt was also very helpless when he met this impulsive partner. But there is no way, the Claw Clan and the Giant Clan have huddled together for warmth for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is said that the typical giants only have muscles and no brains; then their multi-clawed race is another extreme.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the pressure of survival, the two races with complementary talents naturally came together.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the giants are not completely brainless. It's just that there are only a few giants with brains, and most of them are impulsive goods.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The multi-claw race is not purely weak, but compared to the ancient survivors in the ice and snow world, the overall strength of the race is weak. For example, Holt is a strong man.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is very simple to judge their strength, just count the claws. One paw represents the first level, and eight paws represent the eighth level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the vanguard, their mission is not to attack the city, but to draw out the human army in the city, or scare them away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no doubt that this mission must have failed. Thinking of this, Holt was full of anger. Since partnering with Catmull, except for successfully scaring off the enemy twice, the rest of the missions all ended in failure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Alliance of the Ancient Survivors can unite, so naturally they have formulated corresponding regulations to restrict everyone's behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For example, the distribution of territory after the war that everyone is most concerned about is linked to the achievements made on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After such a toss by Catmull, it is naturally impossible for the defenders in the city to go out of the city to attack. If there is no escape now, it means that there is a high probability that there will be a **** battle next.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the Alliance of Ancient Survivors, it is better not to fight siege battles for the land they want, which is not very profitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the number of Dingkou of each race in the alliance limited?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't prepare in advance, you'll be ready to fight now, and when the human race launches a counterattack, they won't be able to hold back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Holt, this is none of my business. It was all the human race who started the fight first, and I just asked my men to fight back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    What's more, isn't the front going very smoothly? Just intimidating the defenders, they ran around in fright.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let me try again, maybe the defenders in the city were also scared away, and we even saved the siege. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Catmull said loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it weren't for the cover of artillery fire, I'm afraid the defenders on the opposite side could hear it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Rolling his eyes helplessly, Holt really wanted the big guy in front of him to continue, since it wasn't his multi-clawed people who died anyway.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in the end, reason still prevails. The clan has already analyzed it: it is okay to use this war to take advantage of the war while the human race has no time to take care of the North Continent;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the alliance of the ancient bereaved clans, the multi-claw clan is a typical example of sending them away when they see each other. However, the progress in the early stage was smooth, giving the main combat faction an absolute upper hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you can't change the overall situation, you can only preserve your strength. Not only to save your own, but also to take care of your allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the giants are a little impulsive, but they don't have much insight, and they don't need to worry about being betrayed by their allies all the time!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Enough, Catmull!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the Principality of Moxi, and the defenders are not Warhammers who were frightened by us. Do not fight a few bitter battles. How can the enemy be intimidated by us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no need to make meaningless sacrifices, let your people retreat out of the range of the enemy's magic crystal cannon, and wait for the large troops to come before launching an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget, your giant family has only tens of thousands of people, if you suffer heavy losses here, how can you go back and explain it? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Holt said angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a price to be paid for flesh and blood against magic technology. In the short confrontation, more than a dozen giants paid the price with their lives, and dozens of giants were injured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The casualties of the defenders were even greater, but they couldn't hold back the large number of human races!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the alien race alliance, except for the orcs who can pile up unscrupulously, the fertility of other races cannot catch up with the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to reduce the loss of the soldiers under his command, Holt would rather be less efficient and wait for the main force to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are elves acting as nurses, and the magic weapons and equipment of the Alliance of Ancient Remnants are not weak. What's more, there is also the accompanying magician group, which are all sharp weapons for attacking difficulties.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, being so cowardly, in addition to lack of siege weapons, the most critical thing is the lack of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Several races added together, can't make up 3,000 troops. If it weren't for the fact that there were five hundred giants among them, he wouldn't have dared to wander here with his team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy retreats!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy retreats!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the cheers of the defenders, Raquel's solemn expression eased a little, and then sank again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Today's catastrophe has been passed, but what should we do next?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Influenced by the Alpha people, the Principality of Moxi also deployed multiple lines of defense on the border. The Augustsburg Line was the principality's first line of defense, and it was also the strongest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no problem with retreating, but it is necessary to inflict some damage on the enemy and buy a certain amount of time for the Principality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't hurt the enemy, you can't even think about peace. Even with the Alpha Kingdom as an ally, we cannot place all our hopes on others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Pass down the order, the whole army will strengthen its vigilance, and strictly guard against the enemy's sneak attack!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition, send someone to the royal capital to inform that the defense of Fort Augustus has begun, and we need the strength of our allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the Alpha Kingdom's reinforcements can't come for a while, please invite Marshal Hudson to help us command the army! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Such cowardly words should not have come from a frontline mouth. If it falls into the hands of political opponents, it is a ready-made handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Raquel doesn't care, even if some small problems cause trouble, the old man in the capital will take care of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now he is the heir of the family, and the political power he can use is far from that of that dude back then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, there are precedents for this kind of thing. The last time the orcs invaded in the middle and late stages of the war, the Principality's army was handed over to Hudson's command, and it would be no big deal to do it again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel is not worried about any opposition. In the last war, almost all the best Nabo noble children of the Principality of Moxi died on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The characteristics of the current military are that it is typical that there is no successor. Just look at his own appointment. If there is a better choice, the king will never appoint him as the front-line coach.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dandy character design for more than ten years has already been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. How can it be changed by one or two wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To drive the ducks to the shelves, and to be promoted to the position of the frontline governor, the biggest problem is that the principality is short of generals!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including that George spent a lot of money to poach the wall from the Alpha Kingdom before, but he was also forced out by reality.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that those small and medium-sized nobles, although they have inherited the fine tradition of martial arts in the Alpha Kingdom, their own abilities are still very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Served as an officer at the level of regimental commander, and the elites among them are barely competent. To be the coach of an army of hundreds of thousands is purely difficult for the strong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the camp of the Expeditionary Army, Hudson did not rush to solve the problems gathered by the various troops. Instead, he delegated power to the officers below to deal with them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rapid march and training is itself preparing for the attack. The problems encountered were actually the exam questions Hudson gave to the officers below.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those with high scores will be entrusted with heavy responsibilities, those with poor performance should be reassigned, and those who should be dismissed should be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time is too tight, and there is no time to conduct systematic training for officers, so they can only play screening.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to the current test, what will be encountered on the battlefield in the future will be the real challenge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson can't guarantee that he will personally lead the team in every subsequent battle. More often, everyone should play freely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, just received news from the territory that the nobles of the coastal provinces have signed peace treaties with the ghost ship.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I just don't know what happened, and the news leaked out suddenly, and Jacob is worried that this matter will cause a storm of public opinion...”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army has its own rules in the army. From the formation of the expeditionary force, there is only one title for Hudson here—Marshal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing what Jose said, Hudson smiled slightly. Leakage is inevitable. If there is no leak, how dare the merchants go to sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This kind of thing happened, and a storm of public opinion will definitely happen. It would be abnormal if the Holy See, who had suffered so much, did not take the opportunity to vent its anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was expected in advance, so it was a group of nobles who signed the contract with the Ghost King, not the Alpha Kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really unreasonable for a kingdom to compromise with heresy. But things are completely different when it comes to a group of nobles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reputation of the \"Three Nether Kings\" resounded throughout the mainland. The local nobles couldn't provoke them and were forced to sign unequal treaties. Logically, it was completely reasonable!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there are no accidents, then under the pressure of public opinion, everyone will join forces to contribute and set up a mission in the mercenary guild to exterminate the three kings of the nether world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter whether someone takes the order, the key is to have a good attitude to prove that everyone and the ghost ship are incompatible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Tell Jacob, don't worry about these trivial things. If the public opinion gets out of hand, go to the mercenary guild with everyone to hang up the quest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to resettling refugees, his next task is to store more grain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next season will not be fallow, and soybeans will be planted in rotation, and the fallow will resume after the war is over. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Continuous cultivation can easily damage the fertility of the land. However, the situation in the mountainous area is special. In addition to using farmyard manure, they are still using marsh brand fertilizer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With these external supplements, even if the fertility of the land is damaged, it will not be too serious. At most, the production will be slightly reduced, and it will still be a bumper harvest for the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the cost of slightly sacrificing the fertility of the land, it is completely worthwhile in exchange for the skyrocketing food production capacity of the territory in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who made the number of refugees in the Moxi Principality increase again?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The local aristocrats were about to use their strength to feed their babies, but they still couldn't help them. Scattering to neighboring countries has also become the best solution to the refugee crisis.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who took the initiative to send it to his door, naturally received the first wave of bonuses. The first batch of 200,000 refugees are now on their way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The second batch of 300,000 refugees is also beginning to gather, and it is estimated that they will be able to leave by the end of the month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the third batch of refugees, the Mosi people have a plan. It is estimated that when Hudson's army crosses the national border, it should be implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With so many people, it is naturally impossible to be just right. The first batch of 200,000 refugees is actually an imaginary number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The dense crowd was running around. People continued to join along the way, and some fell on the way. Officials of the Principality of Moxi didn't know exactly how many people there were.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If there is no accident, the follow-up immigration work will be done in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the number of refugees entering the Moxi Principality remains high, and the final total number of immigrants exceeds 1.5 million, that is also very possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't want to be choked to death by stuffed pie, you can only prepare food in advance. The previous storage was not enough, and the market was controlled by the kingdom, so the next step was to tap its own grain production potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Okay, Marshal. I'll write Jacob back later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other thing is another request for help from the Principality of Moxi, I hope you can go there first to help them command the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Judging from the intelligence collected by the Kingdom, the Mosi people's preparations for war are still going well, but they themselves seem to have no confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the officers on the front line have no confidence in themselves, and all the princes and ministers in the Principality also have doubts about the ability of their commander. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frankly speaking, Jose didn't believe it when he first received the news. If you are not confident, then change someone!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But after learning about the actual situation of the Principality of Moxi, he expressed his understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Those who are capable have devoted their allegiance to the Principality. The rest are short guys who are selected as generals, if they can make do with it, just have fun!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Driving more broken soldiers than their own army, and not being led to a collapse in morale, it all proves that the Moxi people still have a brave spirit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"How far is our location from Fort Augustus?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Eight hundred and seventy miles. According to our current marching speed, we can reach it in ten days at most.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jose replied without thinking.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the chief staff officer in the Hudson Army, he knows all kinds of data. Distance, marching speed, these basic data are naturally handy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After wandering a few steps in the tent, Hudson looked at the map on the wall and said slowly: \"At this point in time, the defense of Fort Augustus should have started.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guard Raquel, I know this person. It is okay to let him defend the city, but it is almost impossible to expect him to use his troops flexibly to fight back against the alien army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Mossi army stationed in Fort Augustus had too many defeated troops. The morale of the defenders must not be high, and I am afraid they will not last long.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I have a feeling that fighter planes will appear soon. Perhaps the day when Fort Augustus fell was when we shot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send an order to double the march distance starting tomorrow. If the physical strength of the horses transporting supplies cannot keep up, then use magic potions for them. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

If this game continues, these ancient survivors will not be able to overcome the big waves at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"enough!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The continental war has entered a critical moment. The human race has already gained the upper hand in the southern continent. Continue to waste time arguing here.

If you don't want to be settled by Qiu Hou, you can only go forward bravely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just the old man's reprimand, which doesn't convince everyone. The essence of the quarrel is that everyone wants others to contribute more and share less benefits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just like the elves instigating the alliance of the ancient survivors to send troops, the core is to reduce the loss of their own family members.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It doesn't matter what you think in your heart. On the surface, everyone is still quiet. After all, in the next war, everyone will rely on the elves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone has their own reasons, and it is doomed to argue that there will be no result, and no one can justify making concessions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Simply write out all the tasks, and we will draw lots directly.

They came to support only a group of magicians, and it would be a baby bump anywhere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the siege is blocked, at worst, a forbidden spell will be released. No matter how crazy, it is impossible for the magician to charge into battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The half-orc kingdom, in the face of the war of annihilation launched by the Frankish kingdom, they have tried their best, and in the end it is inevitable to start the battle to defend the king's capital.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the refugees gathered outside the city, Azevedo XVII said solemnly: \"Franks, this is to kill them all!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large amount of land subjugated also means a large loss of population.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Kingdom of Franks didn't play genocide right away, but their gameplay was even crueler than direct massacre.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A large number of half-orcs were expelled from their homes and embarked on the road of exile. It seems to have given a way out, but in fact it is to disrupt the rear of the orc kingdom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This is the conspiracy of the Franks. No matter what measures the Orc Kingdom takes, the end result is wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking out materials for relief will consume strategic material reserves and affect their war potential.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Leave it alone, the stomach is very disgusting for refugees, but they can do anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    You can't massacre refugees yourself, can you?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the half-orc kingdom is in a barbaric era, this order to massacre its own people will still arouse resistance from the people of the country.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the influx of refugees, for the safety of the capital, Azevedo XVII had to order the closure of the capital and prohibit the entry of refugees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, this is a temporary solution, not the root cause. Refugees outside the city are a hidden danger after all. Once the Frankish army arrived, these people were cannon fodder for the siege.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In previous continental wars, similar cases have happened countless times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, the law of the jungle is the essence of the Aslant continent. For the continuation of the race, someone must sacrifice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the dragon clan in ancient times, the overlords of the continent all wanted to dominate the continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But none of these races fell down in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The human race doesn't know how to restrain their ambitions, and sooner or later they will have to pay the price. We just need to hold the line and wait for the situation to turn. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Prime Minister Philemon comforted him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The overlords of the mainland did decline, but before they fell, countless races had already paid the price of extermination.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Which of the great clans that can be passed down from the ancient times to the present is not covered in blood?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Land resources do not fall from the sky. If you want to better pass on civilization, you must fight for it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Any time of soft-heartedness may bring disaster to one's own race in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Send a message to the elves, telling them that the kingdom will not be able to withstand it. If we don't see any more reinforcements, we will surrender to the human race!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Azevedo XVII said viciously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The surrender of the whole family means a complete surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is a high probability that it will be reduced to cannon fodder and become a sharp blade in the hands of the human race to attack all races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a few battles of consumption, the family property was completely wiped out, and they had to rely on the human race to make a living.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this case, it can only be said that it is a little bit better than exterminating the genocide, but if there is a choice, no one will do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But once dry, the consequences are very serious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The result of one increase and one decrease is the imbalance of strength between the human race and the alien race alliance, and the war in the southern continent is likely to end in a short time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victorious countries, even if they allocate one-tenth of their strength to reinforce their allies, it will rewrite the situation in the Central Continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the wars in the two places end with the victory of the human race, it will be useless no matter how well the Northern Continent fights.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially, the current war trend in the North Continent has not been as smooth as expected by the Alien Alliance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the mother tree, the three elven queens gathered together with frowning faces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sister, this group of disgusting half-orcs is really too rampant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    dare to threaten us with surrender, it is simply...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps she was really annoyed, the grassland elf queen couldn't find an adjective for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Threatening an ally with surrender, this kind of weird thing happened for the first time in a continental war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is really embarrassing to say it, but it is effective!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once the half-orcs surrender, it will be a stimulus to the entire continental battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case other races can't bear the casualties and follow suit, then it's over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the current situation in the mainland, if all the alien races work together, the human race will not be sure of victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the foreign races are willing to surrender, the nations of the human race will inevitably accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared to military means, political means are the strength of the human race. Given the choice, the nobles of the human race also don't want to work hard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in this way, the elves will be embarrassed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If other alien races surrender to the human race, what should they do?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following surrender, I can't bear the grievance; persisting alone, it seems that the risk is too great.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it is used by the human race to kill chickens and monkeys, it will be a tragedy. The situation was ten times worse than the worst scenario they had expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Second Sister, don't be angry. The more this happens, the more we must hold our ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    President Azevedo XVII must have been forced to speak in a hurry, but it does not mean that he really wants to surrender to the human race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as there is a glimmer of hope, they will choose to persevere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It seems that the situation in the half-orc kingdom is worse than what we know. The original support was no longer enough to help them stabilize the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Take military action in advance!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First destroy the three countries of Kantruo, Ustad, and Fick, and make a gesture to show the allies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, they sent a group of magicians to the half-orc kingdom to help them stabilize the situation first. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the forest elf queen's heart seemed to be bleeding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is easy to join a war, but difficult to end it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Because of being too close to the elves, the development of the three principalities of Kantruo, Usta, and Fick has not been smooth, especially the slow growth of military strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The population ratio and the number of masters are seriously out of proportion. The premature death rate of genius children is even more surprisingly high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To solve such an opponent, the elves have no pressure. The only question is how much it will cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Elder Sister, why don't we act together with the army of the Ancient Remnants Alliance after the destruction of the Three Kingdoms?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The night elf queen couldn't help but suggest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Third sister, this matter needs to be discussed in the long run. If we join forces, there will be more conflicts and conflicts between us, which is not conducive to our development.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Forest Elf Queen shook her head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's not that she doesn't want to act with her allies, but the elves' looks are too outstanding, which conforms to the aesthetics of most races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to past experience, as long as it is a joint action, some people will eventually do things that are not conducive to unity because of the brains of some people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the elves are not a race that can swallow their anger. When encountering things, they will only make a big fuss and will not suppress it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In case the old things happen again, maybe the enemy is not dealt with, and the allies will fight first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The changes in the international situation have directly affected the Moxi battlefield. The participation of the elves in the war directly stimulated the alliance of the ancient survivors and the orc empire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone has a point of view, the battlefield in the North Continent is stable. No matter how the countries of the Northern Continent struggle, they are also powerless against the alliance of the three major alien races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any hesitation, the orcs and the Alliance of the Ancient Remnants made the same decision—intensify their attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I really can't drag it on any longer. If they continue to dawdle, when they want to distribute the spoils in the future, they will have nothing to do.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to interests, allies are not easy to use. Especially the Alliance of Ancient Survivors, who were originally close to the elves, were even more stimulated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone knows that in ancient times, the elves once suffered a big loss from the vassal race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the human race was expelled from the Northern Continent this time, even if the land was inexhaustible, even if it was left for the Warcraft to live, they would not be able to give it up to other intelligent races.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to leave enough living space for your own race, the only option is to grab the territory quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, the Ancient Remnants Alliance is composed of many races. Even if the cake is too big, it will become smaller when distributed to each race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no threat to the elves, so naturally there is no need to worry about attracting fear. There is the great enemy of the race, and the ally relationship can last for many years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The alien coalition forces are really serious, and the defenders on the front line of Fort Augustus are sadly reminded. Facing the enemy's heavy siege, the defenders with low morale were really unable to stand up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the fortresses lost their heads one after another, Fort Augustus was once again reduced to an isolated city, and Raquel suddenly had a lot of white hair on his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The early collapse of the defenders along the line disrupted his entire military deployment. According to the original plan, the Augustsburg defense line can withstand the enemy for at least two months.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that there are too many pig teammates, and the supervising team can only delay the collapse of the army, but it can't boost the morale of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As long as the rout had escaped once, they would not mind running a second time. It's okay to fight with the wind, but once there is a headwind, these people will be the first to collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, placing the defeated soldiers of the Eastern Warhammer Kingdom on the front line is the biggest failure in military deployment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that the Principality of Moxi has no choice, and Raquel has no choice. If you don't put the broken soldiers on the front line as cannon fodder, is it possible to throw them behind to add chaos?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The roaring artillery fire kept ringing, but if you listen carefully, you will find that the interval between the sound of magic crystal artillery in the city is getting longer and longer, but the frequency of artillery fire outside the city is increasing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"My lord, the enemy has attacked again. Now the mage group has suffered heavy losses, and they are powerless to stop the enemy from releasing the forbidden spell. The city wall may be...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the young officer finished speaking, Raquel interrupted: \"I see. According to the established plan, after the outer city falls, the troops will be withdrawn to the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pass down the order to send out all the supervisory teams. If someone flees the battle, they will be killed without mercy! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Raquel took out a handkerchief and wiped the knight's sword. After waving his hand to signal the officer to leave, he muttered to himself:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Old friend, it's time to go all out again. I don't know if we will be lucky enough to leave this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    well!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you are spiritual, you must be scolding me at this moment: let your kid show off. He is obviously a second-generation dude, but he wants to come out...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way. When the principality is at the moment of life and death, someone has to step up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the last war, the elites of the Principality almost died. Now it's my turn to useless trash like me, reinforcements...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Above the clouds, Hudson watched the offensive and defensive battle of Fort Augustus with cold eyes. As soon as he is successful, he has gone through countless battles, and he has long learned to have a heart of stone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements are just two hundred miles away. As long as he gives an order, they can reach the front line in a day, and it is not a problem to keep Fort Augustus. Only in this way, it is impossible to seriously injure the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to achieve a greater record, you can only let the defenders continue to consume the alien coalition forces outside the city. It doesn't matter how many enemies you kill, the key is to turn the enemy into a tired soldier.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the gathering of elements below, Hudson knew that the enemy was preparing a forbidden spell. If they intervene at this moment, the enemy's magician group will suffer heavy losses and buy more time for the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's a pity that Hudson didn't have time. The sudden change in the international situation made him have to find a way to solve it quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy army in front of him is just one of his goals, and there are still many enemies waiting for him in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The magic array defending the city is broken, and it is destined to be unable to block the attack of the forbidden curse, and the outer city will not be able to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a short period of time, the enemy should not be able to release the forbidden spell, and the inner city is estimated to be able to hold on for a few days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bear Stearns, you go for a trip yourself. Let the army move, and close the distance between the two sides to a hundred miles before dark. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The coach personally acts as scout, no one else. But there is no way, if someone else comes over, they will definitely be discovered by the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including large army operations, it is actually difficult to keep secrets. The enemy also has air power and is constantly monitoring all directions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the way to Guang, Hudson has successfully dealt with many enemy spies, but it is still a drop in the bucket.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Including his current hiding, it is only for the enemy below. If you encounter the enemy's air power at close range, you will be exposed in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Concealment magic is not omnipotent, once in close contact, it cannot be hidden at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only when the army keeps a certain distance, so that the enemy is not aware of the approaching danger, can they fight boldly with confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In a sense, Hudson is taking a gamble right now. Bet that the enemy doesn't know that the reinforcements sent by the kingdom this time are all the best of the best.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ordinary troops can travel tens of miles a day, but elite cavalry can easily run one or two hundred miles. This distance is not the distance that cavalry can run every day, but on the premise of maintaining a certain combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you don't consider combat power, you can do it for thousands of miles a day. The only problem is that it is too useless, and only a few high-quality horses can do it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a loud bang, the walls of Fort Augustus fell. The collapsed city wall was hundreds of meters long, and such a large gap could no longer be blocked just by thinking about it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loud horn sounded, and the army that received the signal swarmed towards the gap, launching the most violent attack on the defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The picture below made Hudson unable to bear to look directly at it, and stopped observing the magic directly, but the nervous Maxim watched it with relish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Maxim, find a place to rest first, we will enter the inner city at night, and help the defenders strengthen their courage to resist!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said indifferently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The enemy's confidence in taking Fort Augustus has been overwhelming, but the morale of the defenders really worries him. If the garrison collapses early, it will be impossible to steal the chicken and lose a lot of rice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Compared with the performance of Moxi's army in the last orc invasion, the quality of the defenders in front of them has dropped by more than one level.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the heads hanging on the city tower, you can tell that the number of deserters is not ordinary. If the guard hadn't been decisive enough to suppress it in time, we don't know what would have happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Intuition told him that a fighter plane was about to appear. As long as the defenders are stable, the next step is to watch the enemy's performance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Although they still have contingency plans, no one wants to activate this early.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy's offensive is too fierce, the defense line of Fort Augustus is in jeopardy; the Principality of Orton is on the verge of collapse, and the two-front battle is inevitable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How to deal with it next, do you have a strategy? \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the king, he is very aware of the plight that the Principality of Moxi is facing now. There are two main reasons for the rapid collapse of the front line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the large number of routs gathered, which affected the morale of the army, there was another practical factor—the defense line was not strong enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defense line of Fort Augustus was originally aimed at the enemy in the north. It was destroyed as early as the last orc invasion. Now the enemy army is coming from the west, and all the defense lines are temporary repairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even the famous Fort Augustus is only a semi-finished product, and its defense is far behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two unfavorable factors are superimposed together. If the frontline defenders can still block the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, it will really be a problem.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anticipated that the defense line would collapse, but George did not expect the front line to collapse so quickly. Anyway, it will take a month or two to buy some buffer time for the Principality!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's depressing enough that your own army's performance is not as good as expected. I didn't expect the performance of allies to be even worse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within ten days of the war, the Principality of Orton lost cities and lands one after another. At this moment, even the capital has become precarious and may fall at any time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There is no point in complaining. The Principality of Orton also suffered heavy losses in the last war. This time, his performance was much better than when he faced the orc invasion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the test paper with a perfect score of 100, the Principality of Orton has at least increased from 10 points to 20 points.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Your Majesty, reinforcements from the Alpha Kingdom are on the way, only two hundred miles away from Fort Augustus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people who came to help this time are all elites. As long as the defenders persist for a few days, the situation will improve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Marshal Hudson personally leading the team, the battle situation on the front line of Fort Augustus can basically be carefree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now we need to pay attention to the terrible situation we will face after the collapse of the Principality of Orton. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Earl Martins said slowly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Ministry of Military Affairs has tried its best, but the strength gap between the two sides is really too great. Coupled with the drag of pig teammates, it is even more difficult to turn the tables.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Martins, the current international situation is very unfavorable to us.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elves have sent troops. If there are no accidents, we will soon receive the sad news of the collapse of the three principalities of Kantruo, Usta, and Fick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Stimulated by this, the alien races seemed to be crazy. Not only the alliance of the ancient survivors stepped up their offensive, but the orc empire also took action.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to the three countries that were destroyed in the Seven Kingdoms of the Grassland, two more countries have reached the final stage. Now only the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Falteren still have a certain strength.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How long they can last, no one can tell. If the prairie wasn't too vast, I'm afraid the prairie battlefield would have ended long ago.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this context, the Alpha Kingdom is about to be overwhelmed, and the support it can provide us is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield of the southern continent, our human race has the upper hand, but it will take some time before the winner is determined.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Besides, even if the war is over, they will support the battlefield in Central China first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At least in the next six months, it will be difficult for us to obtain strong support from the Terran Alliance. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Count Renato said with a embarrassed face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For diplomatic issues, the core of the gist is always interests.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On this basis, if a great diplomat is born, only one or two miracles can happen occasionally by operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it does not involve core interests, the diplomacy of Aslante mainland is not as effective as letting the king come forward to win favors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is normal to help relatives or not to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clearly not applicable in the current situation. No matter how many royal families of various countries marry, they must make concessions for the national strategy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want to change the strategic decision of a big country, the price you need to pay is definitely not a little bit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to keep the foundation of the principality, George has tried to buy off Caesar IV and Hudson, but it doesn't mean that he still has the ability to buy off the countries of the southern continent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was all caused by the collapse of the Warhammer Kingdom. If it weren't for the prodigal son of Joseph II, the current situation would definitely not be so bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the past, when the mainland war broke out, there was nothing like the ancient survivors. Every time a continental war breaks out, they fight each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Count Renato, the situation may not be that bad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The ancient survivors have been suppressed by the Warhammers. Their true strength should not be as powerful as everyone expected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defeat on the battlefield was mainly due to the severe loss of the principality's strength. Compared with three years ago, our strength has not increased but decreased.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't forget that the nobles have been recovering their vitality in recent years. A copper coin can't wait to be dressed in two halves. Everyone knows what kind of life the serfs are living.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I can't even fill my stomach, so I don't have the strength to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The veterans that the Principality painstakingly cultivated during the last war have been starved to death in recent years, and their combat effectiveness is at most four or five points left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation in the Alpha Kingdom is much better. With the Hessians jumping out to spread hatred, the nobles in their country dare not relax their armaments at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Aristocrats with a little family background will regularly organize serfs for military training, and the veterans' combat strength is relatively much better preserved. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening to Prime Minister Herceg's analysis, everyone's expressions improved a lot, followed by embarrassment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finally accumulating a group of veterans, in order to save ration expenses, they tossed away their combat effectiveness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even if you want to spray it, they themselves are also \"idiots who throw watermelons just to pick up sesame seeds.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the last war ended, everyone in the principality believed that the world was peaceful, and they directly released Nanshan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only was the combat effectiveness of the serf soldiers lost, but the number of the standing army was also greatly reduced, so that after the outbreak of the Continental War, they were caught off guard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, the body cannot be raised in a day or two. Before accepting the call-up, they couldn't eat enough to eat, and after the call-up, they were limited to barely filling their stomachs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not every commander is as strong as Hudson, who can get enough meat for the soldiers. Most generals don't care what the soldiers eat at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The matter has come to this point, it is useless to say more. After we get through this crisis, let's learn a lesson!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Recently, the number of refugees who have poured into the principality is quite large. First arrange for people to send them away, and the relief rations saved are just used as military rations. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    George said expressionlessly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Once you stumble, you will be hated forever.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    An inconspicuous little detail actually affected the combat effectiveness of the Principality's army. It's too late to regret, but there are still remedies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If the source cannot be opened, the flow will be cut off. It is difficult to reduce other expenses, but the expenditure on relief of refugees is expected to be reduced in a short period of time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    are all promised conditions. Sending people over earlier will not only show sincerity, but also reduce food consumption.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As for recruiting refugees to supplement the country's population, it should be considered when the war is about to win. You can't arrange people down with the front foot, and tell everyone to flee with the back foot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, the **** battle in Fort Augustus continued. The only difference is that the atmosphere in the headquarters is no longer so lifeless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Among the officers in the room, few of them Hudson could name. It doesn't matter if he doesn't know these people, anyway, it's enough for everyone to know him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The name of a person, the shadow of a tree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hudson sat down, everyone felt a lot more at ease. The coach is here, can the reinforcements be far behind?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Everyone, relax a little, don't be so nervous. There are only a bunch of low-level coalition forces of ancient survivors outside, and their era has long passed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Jumping out to be active now is nothing more than relying on the support of the elves, trying to take advantage of our Northern Continent when we are the weakest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't be affected by the rout of soldiers, just treat them as strong enemies. In fact, it caught you off guard. As long as you stabilize the morale of the army, the enemies outside are nothing to worry about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reinforcements are already on the way, and the enemy doesn't give up attacking the city late at night, because they don't have much time left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    cheer me up, you are all like this, what do the officers and soldiers below think?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That's the end of today's meeting. Everyone should perform their duties and fulfill their tasks. Don't let the enemy take advantage of it. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Hudson's calm expression, the people who were panicked suddenly calmed down as if they had been injected with a tranquilizer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No problem, now is the era of the human race, and the ancient survivors outside the city are all settled in dilapidated houses. If it is really strong, it will not be suppressed by the Warhammer Kingdom for hundreds of years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that the enemy's attack is really fierce, much stronger than the orc cannon fodder back then, and the combat power is almost catching up with those elite orc legions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fortunately, the strength of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors was not as terrifying as when the orcs invaded. During the battle, the enemy commanders tried to reduce casualties as much as possible, otherwise the battle would have been impossible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that Raquel hesitated to speak, Hudson scolded with a smile:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Hesitating, this is not your Raquel's style. What about the arrogance of a dandy who was so invincible back then, could it be that he was frightened by a few foreign races?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Giving orders as soon as he came over, it wasn't that Hudson was grabbing power, but that he really had the right.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As early as the last war, he was awarded the title of Marshal by the Principality of Moxi, and his status was higher than that of everyone present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time, the Principality of Moxi invited him to be the commander-in-chief. It is also in line with the procedure to come over to take over the command of the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar cases have never happened on the continent of Aslante.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson is the marshal of two countries. In history, there are also fierce men who are also marshals of all nations and command the coalition forces of all countries.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was a special case, the existence of precedent still provided a legal basis for him to command the army of the Principality of Moxi.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, these are all theoretical. Whether or not he can command and move people in reality still depends on personal prestige. If the officers on the front line don't buy it, the title of marshal is a vain title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal... no... the main... oh... I'm ashamed of you!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said hesitantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, he has not lost his reputation as a successor of Hudson. In a sense, he was able to serve as the hard-working frontline governor because he did it himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cowhide blown out, no big deal. As long as the record can keep up, it will be a good story in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sadly Raquel had bad luck and took over a mess. It was too late to clean up, and the enemy came to kill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"You don't have to do that, you've actually done pretty well. Looking across the entire continent, there aren't many people capable of commanding hundreds of thousands of troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Don't look down on the lively fight between the mainland and the southern mainland. In fact, they made a lot of jokes. They just deliberately blocked the news for the sake of face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The speed of the fall of the Fort August defense line was indeed a little faster, but that was because there were too many routs gathered. Even with consecutive defeats, they generally retreated in an orderly manner. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson deliberately beautified said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had no idea how the offensive and defensive battle on the front line of Fort Augustus was fought.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Hudson arrived on the battlefield, the front line collapsed in sevens and eighties, leaving only a few fortresses standing firm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called orderly retreat is purely a statement of high emotional intelligence. The real situation is that after the outer city fell, the defenders swarmed towards the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Generally retreated in an orderly manner. That was because he ran fast enough and had set up a large number of traps in the city beforehand. Most of the troops were successfully evacuated to the inner city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, do you think the military deployment of the city defense needs to be adjusted?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Raquel took out a map and handed it to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There is nothing to adjust. The most taboo thing at this time is to toss around and follow the established plan.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson shook his head and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The siege battle has already started, and the military adjustment of the city defense will be boring.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson and the generals of the Principality of Moxi are familiar with him, but his understanding of other people's abilities is very limited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you make something happen, there is no benefit other than damaging your own reputation, so it is better not to make adjustments.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Anyway, it's just delaying time, as long as it can fatigue the enemy, it doesn't matter how you fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was late at night, and it was unknown whether the enemy was tired from fighting, or simply not in a hurry, and the offensive gradually came to a standstill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's just that wars are never one-sided. If the enemy army wants to rest, they must first ask Hudson if he is willing to agree.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laquer hid the magic crystal cannon at the bottom of the press box, and they were all pulled out at the moment, and the enemy immediately began to greet them as soon as they retreated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    How many enemies are killed is second, the key is loud enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The atmosphere on the battlefield was already tense, but with such a loud noise in the middle of the night, those who could fall asleep were ruthless people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, the raid team you ordered has been organized, do you want to launch a night attack now?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel asked concerned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After so many days of being beaten so aggrieved, he already wanted to fight back. However, his teammates were not strong enough, and Raquel really didn't dare to take risks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It's not a night raid, it's just pulling the team out for a walk.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Send the order down, open the city gate and let the commandos go out to feign an attack. Once the enemy counterattacks, they will retreat immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The moonlight is good tonight, a city gate is swaying once, and the enemy cannot sleep well. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, Hudson cast his gaze into the distance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a distance of only a hundred miles, the Warcraft cavalry can kill them in less than an hour. The other elite cavalry were not much slower.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Calculating the time, the expeditionary force has already rested for five or six hours. After another two or three hours of tossing, when the enemy army is most exhausted, it is the best time to make a surprise attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, what if the enemy responds and enters the city?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Raquel said in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, the defenders were frightened. If the enemy attacked the city at night, Fort Augustus might fall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"It doesn't matter, I just want to let them in. The deployment you made in the city, it's okay to delay them for a few hours, right?\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Hudson's question, Raquel nodded hastily. A few hours is too contemptuous. Even if nothing is prepared, the tens of thousands of defenders in the city cannot be killed by the enemy in a few hours.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Execute the order, if everything goes well, the enemy will be defeated tonight!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loud horn sounded, and the expeditionary force immediately assembled. A dragon chant broke through the air, and Hudson landed in front of the formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The officer distributed the magic potion to all the soldiers, and immediately gave it to the horses under his crotch.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this order, everyone was slightly taken aback. There is no shortage of magic potions to stimulate the potential of warhorses in the continent of Aslant, but everyone doesn't use them very much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not to mention the high cost of medicine, the side effects are also particularly serious. It cannot be said that once used, all war horses will be scrapped, but a loss of 40 to 50% is still normal, and the lifespan of war horses that are lucky enough to recover will also be greatly reduced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, deterred by Hudson's majesty, the order was still carried out. Although war horses are valuable, they are nothing compared to winning wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one jumped out to question, Hudson nodded in satisfaction. The army is not a place to talk about democracy, especially in times of war, only one voice is enough.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now everyone is worried about the safety of the horses and has doubts in their hearts. After this war is over, everything will disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the kingdom's most famous magic potion master, it is very reasonable to prepare a stimulating potion without side effects.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now that his status is determined, Hudson can expose something a little bit without worrying about causing prying eyes from the outside world.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"A good opportunity to defeat the enemy has arisen. All the soldiers listen to my orders, abandon all supplies and heavy weapons, and immediately raid Fort Augustus!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the voice hit the ground, the ground trembled. The scene of thousands of horses galloping together is like a big earthquake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army embarked on the journey without the slightest delay. With a dragon chant piercing through the air, Hudson had disappeared in place.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Hudson reappeared over Fort Augustus, the **** battle had begun again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were no accidents. Not only was the dispatched raiding team bitten by the enemy, they also let them seize the opportunity and charged up the city wall in one fell swoop.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the opportunity to be delivered to their door, the representatives of all ethnic groups in the camp of the Allied Forces of the Remained Ancient Clans almost lost their eyeballs in shock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"What are you doing in a daze, quickly order the whole army to attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priest Remo hastily reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He is not a professional soldier, but after climbing the city wall, he still knows that he will take the opportunity to expand the results of the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, he couldn't help sighing: Bless the elf goddess!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All kinds of horns sounded almost at the same time. The representatives of all ethnic groups who woke up all ran to their own teams to command the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless soldiers of the ancient survivors poured into the city through some torn holes. Despite the desperate resistance of the defenders, they were still unable to withstand the enemy's attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Shouts and screams resounded all over the world for a while, and countless defenders didn't know what happened, but they saw the enemy approaching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It's in chaos, the whole Fort Augustus is in chaos. Accompanied by the attack of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, the whole city was soon engulfed in the flames of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for Raquel who vaguely guessed the truth, everyone didn't know what happened and could only meet the enemy in panic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal, this...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he finished speaking, Hudson interrupted: \"Don't worry, everything will be resolved in an hour.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the current situation, the Alpha Kingdom has no choice, and the Moxi Principality has no choice. We can only make a quick decision, all sacrifices are for the final victory! \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do a complete set, deceive others first deceive yourself. In order to fool the enemy, Hudson had to come and break the city once.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Time passed by, the **** killing continued, and the sound of horseshoes shaking the earth suddenly came from afar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Not good, enemy attack!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Tanma passed the news to the coalition of the ancient survivors, the representatives of all the clans were commanding their own troops to fight. When the news reached the hands of the commanders, the sound of galloping horses also came.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late to realize the danger at this moment. The main army that had invaded the city was fighting in a scuffle at the moment, and they would not be able to withdraw for a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The officers and soldiers who stayed in the camp had just come out to organize defense, and the monster cavalry had already rushed towards them. Many coalition soldiers died before they could react.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sequelae of the separate camps of various ethnic groups are also exposed at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Weary soldiers and weak troops against the elite of the human race, the battle was one-sided from the very beginning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Facing the attack of the Alpha Kingdom army, the various tribes that are not affiliated with each other can only fight on their own, and there is no effective resistance at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Get out of the city immediately!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The generals of various ethnic groups on the front line issued orders to retreat one after another. Everyone knows that once the camp outside the city is lost, the offensive and defensive momentum will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the blow to the morale of the army is even more incalculable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The orderly retreat that was supposed to take alternate cover has now become a swarm of bees rushing out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The composition of the coalition forces of the ancient survivors is too complicated. Everyone is wary of their allies. No one can guarantee that they will leave cover. After the teammates left the city, they left them and ran away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not clear whether there is an enemy stealing camp outside the city, and the terrified coalition soldiers can only retreat desperately, and their combat effectiveness has dropped by more than half in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy army has been routed, Raquel sent an order to order all the defenders to launch a counterattack immediately, and these remnants cannot be allowed to run away!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The main force of the enemy still exists, but in the dark scene, neither side can figure out the specific situation of the other side, so the coach naturally needs to build confidence for everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Morale, this thing is very mysterious. The defenders, who were originally distracted and only fighting for their lives, gradually mustered up the courage to launch a counterattack after seeing the enemy's desperate retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In normal times, a counterattack of this magnitude is nothing at all. But the entanglement of the defenders at this moment has greatly delayed the retreat of the troops of all ethnic groups.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the battlefield, time is life. In the blink of an eye, one large army camp fell, followed by the second and third... one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the blessing of the night, the panic-stricken foreign coalition soldiers finally left the camp overwhelmed, chose a direction at random and fled for their lives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the tribal civilization system, if one person takes the lead in escaping, it is often a group of tribes running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The big picture, that's not what ordinary soldiers need to think about, they just want to stay alive.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The situation is not good for offering sacrifices to the Lord. The human army has stolen the camp, and there is chaos everywhere at the moment, I'm afraid...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the middle-aged elf finished speaking, Remo nodded. The current situation is really unexpected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The biggest sequelae of the multitude of races is the difficulty of command. No one can convince soldiers of all races. Once chaos occurs, it is often irreversible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Let's wait and see the situation first. If the army that invaded the city fails to withdraw to rescue the camp in time, let's find a chance to retreat!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is one thing to support the coalition forces of the ancient survivors, but it is unnecessary to stay and be buried with them. Especially since they just released the forbidden spell during the day, all earth magicians are now a burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The war reached a critical moment, the two sides fought together, seeing that there was no need for their own command, Hudson also appeared on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Forcibly ordering Maxim to shrink in size, one person, one dragon, and one bear shuttled across the battlefield, constantly using black hands to beat Sap.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially the big giant is Hudson's favorite. It is right to shoot the arrow directly, and even the time of aiming can be saved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The only problem is that Bear Stearns always likes to compete with him for heads. Many times, the opponent's head will be blown off before the arrow flies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim was also not idle, as soon as he sneezed, the big man fell down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If someone approaches, the tail and paws will instantly become giants, followed by a pile of meat paste.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The cruel killing scene made Hudson almost vomit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most eye-catching performance on the battlefield is the 5,000 monster cavalry, which properly attack the sharp sword. Wherever the army points, there will be a sea of ​​corpses in an instant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before the coalition forces of the ancient survivors could withdraw, they had already pierced through the camp of the coalition forces that stretched for more than a dozen miles, and then rushed straight across the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the increasing number of deserters, the elves who were watching the situation couldn't bear the pressure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Withdraw!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priest Remo, who lacked experience in command, had no idea that a large group of people would evacuate together, which was the easiest way to attract enemy attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hundreds of elves acted together, instantly attracting the attention of the monster cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are also alien races, and they are also divided into ranks and ranks within the human race. Compared with the ancient survivors who are not taken seriously, the elves have always been the focus of attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When it comes to the battlefield, this \"focus\" is naturally transformed into a key target. Now that they have met, naturally they cannot be allowed to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With hordes of elves attracting firepower, the demoralized coalition soldiers hurriedly seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson, who couldn't stand the scene of his monster killing the enemy brutally, left the inner city decisively, and bumped into the fleeing elf team as soon as he came out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without waiting for his order, Bear Stearns, who was addicted to playing sap, had already turned into a mini bear and charged over.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A pure and lovely young elf lady was knocked into the air without knowing what happened.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"There are enemies!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After shouting loudly, Priest Lei Mo hastily set up the magic defense cover.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Too bad it doesn't make any sense, \"crispy elf mage\" is no joke. Being approached by the bear of the earth, even the elf mage in the sanctuary would suffer a lot, not to mention that he is only an eighth-level great magister.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After smashing the magic shield with a slap, and incidentally smashing an arm of Priest Remo, Bear Stearns, who had taken advantage of it, immediately left in a blink of an eye.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Sacrifice to the Lord!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all the elves exclaimed, they were vigilant, vigilant, and curative. Priest Li Mo successfully recovered a small life, but the short delay also ruined their best time to escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brigade of monster cavalry came over, and there was also a dragon and a bear watching closely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After shooting all the arrows in his hand, Hudson picked up the artifact \"Sacred Sword of Light\", but was embarrassed to find that he had no chance to perform by himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maxim, who is fully fired, has a persuasion attribute. After seeing his big man, all the enemies decisively chose to get out of the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Melee combat with a giant dragon is a game that only monsters in the sanctuary dare to play. The desire to survive in the subconscious will instinctively make everyone choose to distance themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Rush out!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priest Li Mo, who reacted, hastily ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The order at this moment was obviously a bit late, and the monster cavalry surrounded by three sides had already killed them. There is no army on the remaining side, but there are dragon knights blocking the way!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the blink of an eye, the two sides fought together. Hudson soon discovered something was wrong, it seemed that the group of elf magicians were out of order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The elf guards were desperately trying their best. They, a group of mages, released their magic, and they kept clicking and searching, as if they were paddling water.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially there are dozens of elves among them, holding the magic wand without moving, as if they were preparing for hand-to-hand combat.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The enemy magician has no magic!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having come to this conclusion, Hudson couldn't help but smile. A magician who has exhausted his magic power is like an ordinary person whose body has been hollowed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No wonder the enemy wants to break out of the encirclement together at this moment. It's not that they don't know how high the risk of doing this is, but that after choosing to disperse and break through, none of these elf magicians can escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The most important magicians are all killed, so what's the use of running out with a few guards?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elves are also divided into grades, grades, grades, and grades. Just like the situation of other races in the mainland, the status of magicians of the same level is slightly higher than that of other professions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the usual practice, the entire army of the magician group was destroyed, and if the guards protecting the magician group survived, they would also be executed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Stop attacking!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson ordered decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Mage groups have important strategic value in any race. Although he wanted to destroy these elves, his reason told him that the group of elves in front of him had greater value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kingdom's army stopped attacking, and the besieged elves also stopped, turning their attention to Priest Remo.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Do you want to go all out? This thought was stifled by Remo as soon as it arose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there are many magicians in the elves, they cannot afford to be squandered at will. If these hundreds of people are damaged, they will also feel pain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Deep in his heart, Lei Mo had already scolded the Allied Forces of the Remnants of the Ancients bloody. One by one greedy for merit and rushing forward, they didn't even care about the big camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, this conclusion is very hasty. The troops left behind in the camp were not weak. The main reason for the scene in front of us was that the officers and soldiers who stayed behind were the ones who attacked the city during the day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All creatures with mortal bodies need to rest when they are tired. Such a simple truth, the commanders of all ethnic groups naturally understand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Let the army take turns to attack, there is nothing wrong with it. The only problem is that they didn't expect that the Alpha Kingdom's army could kill them so quickly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Marshal Hudson Koslow of the Alpha Kingdom is here, please come and talk to the representatives of the elves!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These ancient battlefield etiquette have long been corrupted in previous continental wars, but that doesn't mean they are useless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the party with absolute advantage, Hudson doesn't mind showing his tolerance. But it was only for a moment, part of the enemy troops in the city had already withdrawn, and they were still waiting for him to clean up, but there was no time to waste too much time here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"The elves sacrificed to Remo, and met Marshal Hudson!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While speaking, the elf old man walked out calmly, as if he was not worried that Hudson would be against him at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Priest Lei Mo, the end of today's war is very obvious. You have fulfilled your duty as a soldier, and there is no point in continuing to struggle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Surrender!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to the ancient covenant of all races, I guarantee that your lives will not be threatened. After the war is over, the elves can leave after paying the ransom for you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson said blankly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Covenant of Ten Thousand Races was established by the various races in the mainland in order to resist the invasion of foreign worlds in ancient times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After experiencing continental wars again and again, the rules inside have long been destroyed. Ninety-nine percent of the creatures on the entire continent have never heard of the \"Covenant of Ten Thousand Races\".\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether to surrender or not, this is a question that makes the elves feel prickly. Originally, with the arrogance of the old man, he would not consider \"surrender\" at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But there is no way, and there is also a group of elf magicians who are besieged. Don't look at the quantity is only a few hundred, but the quality is high!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To put it bluntly, the entire Moxi Principality couldn't make up such a lineup. Even if the Alpha Kingdom wants to gather so many mid-level and high-level magicians, it still needs to issue a recruitment order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the old man hesitated, Hudson immediately added: \"I know elves are not afraid of sacrifice, but you don't think about yourself, but also about the inheritance of the race.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous continental wars, once involved, are useless and no one can escape unscathed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the nobles chose to send troops to join the war, the casualties must have been tens of thousands. Maybe you are not short of this kind of strength now, but it does not mean that you will not lack it after the war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For the sake of the continuation of the race, I suggest that Your Majesty the Priest should consider it carefully. After all, the fertility of the elves is really worrying, there is no need to sacrifice your life for a war that does not belong to you. \"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fudge, flick to your heart's content.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The inheritance of the elves has nothing to do with him. If he didn't want to use these elves as bargaining chips in future negotiations, he wouldn't bother to persuade them here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking back, Priest Li Mo read the desire for life from the eyes of the elves. Being able to survive, no one wants to die.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson's words became their best psychological comfort. This is not their war, they are here to help, and there is no need to fight for the alliance of the ancient survivors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Dear Marshal Hudson, we can surrender, but you must ensure that we will not be insulted!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Priest Remo suppressed his emotions and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They are all old elves, and Hudson naturally knows why he accepted the surrender.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the continent of Aslante, only valuable creatures are eligible to live. There is no doubt that the group of elf magicians in front of them has enough value.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Yes, I guarantee with the reputation of the nobility, as long as you follow the rules after you surrender, you can enjoy the treatment of prisoners of war in the Covenant of Ten Thousand Races.\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson pretended to be impatient and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing that Priest Morey, who had no money to struggle with, sighed, he handed over the magic wand in his hand to Hudson.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately afterwards, all the elves also put down their weapons. The original tense emotions no longer exist, and there is only relief for the rest of my life after the catastrophe.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is not an easy task to lose a life in a race war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Especially in the last few hundred years, there has been very little acceptance of captives in continental wars.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It made a good start, and Hudson's killing intent faded, and he immediately ordered to his troops: \"Send down the order and let all the troops shout: Surrender without killing, we accept the prisoners!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rules of the game have always been formulated by the strong. In order to reduce the enemy's resistance and reduce the loss of the army, Hudson does not mind modifying some rules according to local conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The earth-shattering shouts came out, making the alien coalition forces fighting on their own even more popular.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that their camp had been lost, many soldiers of various ethnic groups who broke out were lost in confusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    \"Run!\"\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I don't know who yelled, and the already chaotic battlefield became even more chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The foreign coalition forces that are not generals, and generals are not generals, involuntarily staged a mob.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The saddest thing is the giant family, big people are always easy to receive special care. Even if you are running for your life, you should be more eye-catching than others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The magic flares that flew out from time to time illuminated their positions clearly, and various arrows kept flying towards them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scene in front of him made Hudson understand why the powerful giants fell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the wind blows, these big guys are always at a disadvantage. When fighting against the wind, they are living targets on the battlefield.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The so-called \"shoulder-to-shoulder dragon\" is purely putting gold on one's face. A dragon can go to the sky and enter the sea, but can a giant do it?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is true that a big giant can kill minions, but that is only limited to minions. When encountering strong men of the same level, their huge bodies are a burden instead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The defense of giants is indeed very good. High-level giants are immune to ordinary bows and arrows, but now is the era of magic crossbows.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many big giants were shot into hedgehogs during the battle without reacting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hudson personally appraised it. Once the Holy Sword of Light is released, even a 30-meter-long man can break the defense with one sword.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the big guys keep falling, the stimulation to the soldiers of the foreign coalition forces was huge, and the number of deserters on the battlefield increased sharply.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As if they didn't see these guys, the Kingdom's army just picked up the alien coalition forces left on the battlefield, as if deliberately letting them go.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, the high-level leaders of the bereaved coalition forces are helpless. This is the enemy's overt conspiracy, and they cannot stop it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the general situation was over, some generals of the race who reacted quickly simply ran away with their own troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fly separately when disaster is imminent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The first ray of sunlight shone at dawn, and the war had come to an end. Only a few foreign soldiers who reacted a step slower were still carrying out sporadic resistance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (end of this chapter)\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
