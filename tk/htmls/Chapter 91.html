<p>   Only after wandering on the verge of death can I know the value of life.</p>
<p>  Originally, Karliss thought that as a devout believer, he could face life and death for his faith, but it turned out that he could not.</p>
<p>  The mission has been messed up, not only did not find the Blood Moon Horn, but also made a huge mess.</p>
<p>   Intercepting and killing the king's special envoy, such a big matter is on the surface. Now not only the Alpha Kingdom wanted his life, but even the Holy See couldn't tolerate him.</p>
<p>   So far, he doesn't know how he was exposed. He was obviously very careful, after killing people and destroying all the clues, he led them away immediately.</p>
<p>  In order to hide his identity, even the flying dragon mount was left dozens of miles away, and even the evidence of his absence was prepared. Theoretically speaking, the Alpha Kingdom shouldn't suspect them.</p>
<p>   Even the treatment of the wounded was carried out in a rural town two hundred miles away. Such a remote place is still a secret stronghold hidden by the Holy See, so the security should be high enough.</p>
<p>  Under normal circumstances, even if the Alpha Kingdom noticed something, by the time they found it, their group should have left long ago.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that just after they settled down, a coalition of nobles came to kill them the next day, and they were not even given a chance to speak up. Many soldiers were killed on the spot before they could get on the flying dragon.</p>
<p>   Those who stayed on the ground died miserably, and those who went to the sky did not escape. Although the Alpha Kingdom doesn't have flying dragon cavalry, it doesn't mean that they have nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>  The flying monsters of several noble families and the kingdom's griffin cavalry formed a team and chased them down.</p>
<p>   Without any accident, the flying dragon cavalry who entered the Alpha Kingdom were directly wiped out.</p>
<p>  Callis was able to escape by luck, but also benefited from the rolling Lancang River. Feilong died in battle, fell into the river and went downstream, allowing him to escape rounds of pursuers.</p>
<p>   Drifting all the way down the river, he just woke up from the coma. Calliss, who calmed down, found himself doing a series of stupid things that he thought were clever.</p>
<p>  Evidence is only needed by the weak. For really big shots, as long as they believe you did it, it doesn't really matter whether there is evidence or not.</p>
<p>  Count Frodo went to the southeast province to deal with the blood moon horn. An accident happened on the way, and the Holy See is the first suspect.</p>
<p>  From the very beginning, people believed that they did it. With this point of view, they looked for clues, and the evidence they found naturally pointed to the Holy See.</p>
<p>  Even if the flying dragon is dozens of miles away, even if alibi is arranged, all these can be understood as counter evidence.</p>
<p>   No matter how remote and hidden it is, it is someone else's territory. Maybe the stronghold he thought was hidden was exposed to others' sight early on.</p>
<p>  The matter has developed to this point, and it is meaningless to delve into the reason.</p>
<p>  The Holy See can no longer go back, such a big thing happened, someone has to be responsible for it.</p>
<p>  The Alpha Kingdom couldn’t wait even more. After killing the king’s special envoy, a lot of nobles wanted to claim credit for his head.</p>
<p>   "Kallis, long time no see! I never expected to see you again, and you are so embarrassed."</p>
<p>   A familiar yet unfamiliar voice came, which startled Karlis. Intuition told him that he should know this masked person, and that he was still very close, but he just couldn't remember who it was.</p>
<p>   "Who are you? When did we meet? What is the purpose of looking for me?"</p>
<p>  Three questions from the soul, after the masked man hesitated slightly, he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>   "Karliss, do you really not remember me?</p>
<p>   You were in the training camp back then, but I led you in. On that stormy night thirty years ago, a wandering in the street..."</p>
<p>   Before the masked man finished speaking, Karlis hurriedly denied.</p>
<p> "impossible!"</p>
<p>   "You can't be him!"</p>
<p>   "He is dead! In the battle to cleanse the great Lord of the Dawn of heresy—battle dead!"</p>
<p>  The tone of voice is biting hard, as if he believes that "he" has died in battle. It's just the hesitation on the surface, which has already betrayed the true thoughts in Karlis' heart.</p>
<p>  Thirty years ago, his family suffered great changes. At the age of eight, he was forced to live on the streets, living a day-to-day life. Until a night of wind and rain, hunger and cold, a mysterious knight appeared and changed his fate.</p>
<p>  Following the mysterious knight, Karliss entered the knight training camp of the Holy See, and stepped into a new world from then on.</p>
<p>   It's just that the rules are strict in the Holy See. As a new quasi-knight, I can't do anything.</p>
<p>  When Carliss had the ability to inquire about the mysterious knight who changed his life and destiny, he was told that the mysterious knight had died in battle.</p>
<p>   All the specific information has been sealed up. Even if Karlis became the commander of the second regiment of the Flying Dragon Cavalry, he still has no right to know.</p>
<p>   "It seems that you have remembered something, but these old things are no longer important, the key is what should you do next?</p>
<p>  The Holy See will definitely not be able to go back. Those rotten moths can't do things well, but their ability to shirk their responsibilities is top-notch.</p>
<p>  Although you messed up the mission this time, the person most responsible is not your turn. If we really want to get to the bottom of it, the idiot who released the Horn of the Blood Moon is the real culprit.</p>
<p>  In a sense, you can actually be considered a hero, at least you didn’t let the corner of the Blood Moon fall into the hands of the Alpha Kingdom.</p>
<p>  Compared with this exact result, losing a flying dragon cavalry is nothing at all. Even if the traces are exposed, it will only let the bad relationship between the two parties be brought from the audience to the stage.</p>
<p>   But this scapegoat must be borne by you. Who let them take root in the Holy See for generations, is the real master of the Holy See, and you are just a foreign grass?</p>
<p>  In fact, if it weren't for the need for someone to work hard. Those guys can't wait to occupy all the positions in the Holy See so that they can enjoy the sacrifices of believers for generations! "</p>
<p>  The words of the masked man are like needles piercing the chest, and the needles **** the atrium of Karlis.</p>
<p>  The shady scenes revealed are all facts, and even the real Holy See is ten times darker than this.</p>
<p>  The clergy of the Holy See, who never married for life and claimed to dedicate everything to the Lord of Dawn, actually developed the Holy See into a hard-core hereditary crop.</p>
<p>  Callis was able to become the commander of the Second Cavalry Regiment, not because of his superiors’ respect. Although he is outstanding, this is not the reason for promotion. The real reason for being promoted is—dangerous work needs someone to do it.</p>
<p>  So he stayed in this position for ten years. During this period, he made countless contributions to the Holy See, but he still didn't move a step forward.</p>
<p>   There is no other reason, the position of being cannon fodder is enough, and if you go further, you must be one of your own.</p>
<p>   "What's the use of saying this now, everything about the Holy See has nothing to do with me. From now on, I am already a dead person to the Holy See.</p>
<p>   Anyway, I still thank you for your kindness. If Your Excellency hadn't picked me up back then, perhaps Karlis would have died on a rainy night thirty years ago.</p>
<p>  It is already earned to live an extra thirty years, and no matter when I die later, I will accept my fate.</p>
<p>  There are still countless pursuers waiting for me, I am afraid I can only remember your kindness first. If Karlis escapes this catastrophe by chance, he will find a way to repay your kindness in the future. "</p>
<p>  Although he said he was accepting his fate, the strong desire to survive was still expressed in his tone. It's just that the matter this time is too big, and it is too difficult to save one's life in the face of a kingdom's pursuit.</p>
<p> "Ha ha…"</p>
<p>   "Karliss, don't be so pessimistic. The Alpha Kingdom wants to hunt down and kill only the Karliss of the Second Flying Dragoon Regiment of the Holy See, not all the Karliss.</p>
<p>  Change your identity, and you will find that the world will never be the same again. Just like that rainy night back then, if you hadn't asked for help, maybe we would have missed it! "</p>
<p>  The words of the masked man startled Karlis. After countless years of social tempering, he is no longer the simple boy he used to be, and he knows very well that there is no love and hate for no reason in this world.</p>
<p>  In any case, he killed an earl of the Alpha Kingdom, and he was charged with such a "crime", which is incomprehensible anywhere, and it is impossible to obtain a pardon.</p>
<p>   "Your Excellency, let's just say it, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>  Frankly speaking, Carliss really doesn’t think he has any capital to let an Alpha kingdom let me go. "</p>
<p>   This is a fact. Although golden knights are rare, it is the same for a kingdom.</p>
<p>  Taking the Alpha Kingdom as an example, there are dozens of Golden Knights on the bright side. It is impossible to recruit him as an enemy desperately just for this little combat power.</p>
<p>   "Karliss, your vision has been limited by the Holy See, and you need to broaden your horizons.</p>
<p>   For big shots, as long as the interests are big enough, hatred is nothing at all.</p>
<p>   Besides, you have no deep-rooted hatred with them, and this account is mainly on the head of the Holy See.</p>
<p>  The king's special envoy who died seemed to have a glamorous appearance, but he was not a real big shot. All his glory came from Caesar III. But he is dead now, and dead people are worthless.</p>
<p>  Your existence now just makes them look bad, but as long as what you do next is beneficial to them, then they can put aside the previous things.</p>
<p>  At least until you lose the use value, they can ignore it.</p>
<p>  Come on, put on this mask and say goodbye to your past life. Next, we will fight for the Lord of Dawn for the rest of our lives, and no one can stop the glory of our Lord from spreading to every corner of the world! "</p>
<p>  After listening to the bewitching words of the masked man, Karliss looked dazed, and he kept interrogating himself in his mind.</p>
<p>  Fighting for the Lord of Dawn is the exclusive slogan of the Holy See. Although other forces would occasionally shout, it was just to enliven the atmosphere, and no one would take it seriously.</p>
<p>  But the mysterious masked man in front of him is serious. This kind of soul recognition from the bottom of the heart, Karliss has only seen it in a very small number of ascetic monks.</p>
<p>  A knight with such a firm belief appeared here in this way, and he also harbored a strong resentment against the Holy See. Karlis suddenly found that he could not understand the world at all.</p>
<p>   Doubts turned into doubts, he still took the mask after being dispelled by the desire to survive.</p>
<p>   Without any magical fluctuations, it is just an ordinary mask.</p>
<p>   Without hesitation, under the eager eyes of the masked man, Karliss put the mask on his face, but his inner doubts became more and more.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  The ups and downs of the outside world did not affect Wright County. Everyone's life is still the same, those who are short of food, those who complain, and those who watch the excitement continue to eat melons.</p>
<p>  Maybe it was because they had no food in their hands and felt insecure, or maybe they didn’t want to support their competitors. After the agreement was reached, Baron Kettley immediately urged the deal.</p>
<p>  In view of the complicated situation in Wright County, neither Hudson nor Kettley wanted to be the first bird, so this transaction became particularly weird.</p>
<p>   Maple Leaf Territories keep getting lost, Baron Kettley is so angry that he scolds the streets every day, and even organizes patrols to **** them, which should be guards.</p>
<p>  Rat plagues broke out in the mountainous territory. Countless big rats swarmed and devoured a lot of food. Baron Hudson was so angry that he rode the earth bear and roared in the forest.</p>
<p>   This weird situation lasted until the population of Maple Leaf Territory was halved, and the two places became peaceful.</p>
<p>  The truth is not important, anyway, this is how the two lords explained it to the outside world. There is no such thing as a transaction. Unless evidence can be found, there will be a price for nonsense.</p>
<p>  As for the extra food that Maple Leaf received, it was smuggled in by a profiteer code-named Mouse, and was bought by Baron Kettley at a high price.</p>
<p>  The increased population of the Mountain Territory was supported by various branches of the Koslow family. This is the advantage of having a large family. If a family gathers one or two hundred people, it quickly gathers more than three thousand people.</p>
<p>  The transaction has just been completed, and when Hudson is deceiving himself and others to avoid suspicion, Baron Kettley visits the Mountain Territory again.</p>
<p>  Being slaughtered last time was not enough, and he would take the initiative to send him to his door again to be slaughtered. Baron Kettley's heart was broken.</p>
<p>   But there is no way, the season of farming is coming soon, but not only are livestock scarce in his territory, even farm tools are pitifully scarce.</p>
<p>  Watching the opposite side plowing the field quickly, while the speed of plowing his own territory was as slow as a snail, Baron Kettley couldn't sit still.</p>
<p>   It was all caused by the war, and the former lord's livestock basically entered the belly of the rebels. The few iron farm implements also failed to escape the poisonous hands of the rebels, and were smelted into weapons early on.</p>
<p>  If you go to the battlefield to rummage, you may be able to find the broken pieces of these weapons. It's just that it's useless to find it. Under the corrosion of iron rust, it has already been reduced to waste.</p>
<p>  Having suffered from food shortage once, Baron Kettley didn't want to try again. There is no way to solve the livestock problem for a while, but the gap in farm tools can be easily filled.</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley, who hesitated again and again in order not to be hungry in the coming year, finally plucked up the courage to visit again.</p>
<p>  A visitor is a customer, and Hudson never treats customers with negligence. This not only offered tea and snacks, it was much better than the previous treatment.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that Baron Kettley didn't focus on these details at all, so it was a waste of effort.</p>
<p>   "Dear Baron Hudson, the main reason for interrupting me this time is to buy a batch of farm tools from you."</p>
<p>   Having dealt with him a few times, knowing Hudson's straightforward temperament, Baron Kettley didn't go around the corner, and directly stated his purpose.</p>
<p>  Different from having to be slaughtered last time, the situation this time is a little bit better. If he is willing to smelt weapons into farm tools, he doesn't have to come out to buy them.</p>
<p>  It is a pity that Baron Kettley, who was born in the Northland, does not have the concept of "merging soldiers to make plows" in his life creed.</p>
<p>  Even though there are still a lot of weapons in his warehouse that are temporarily unusable, even though he knows that he may be slaughtered if he comes here at this time, he still comes.</p>
<p>   "No problem, the farm tools are in the warehouse behind, you can go there and pick whatever you want.</p>
<p>   It's just that the recent soaring prices have raised the production cost of farm tools, so the price of farm tools is a little bit more expensive than before.</p>
<p>  However, you can rest assured that as the largest supplier of agricultural tools in the Southeast Province, the price here is definitely the cheapest.</p>
<p>  Of course, mountain collars only do wholesale business and do not accept scattered business. Combination products are not sold individually. All products are sold at least 200 pieces, and the minimum consumption amount for each transaction should not be less than 500 gold coins. "</p>
<p>   Hudson introduced enthusiastically.</p>
<p>  Of course, the following restrictions are completely added temporarily. Such a high threshold is not entirely for deceiving people, but mainly for the appearance fee of Master Hudson.</p>
<p>  With his title of "Shen Bow Knight", even if he went out to become a mercenary, he would need at least 200 gold coins to start, and there would be bonuses for killing enemies, and he would also have to participate in the share for robbery.</p>
<p>   It is fully twenty times that of ordinary knights, which is still the minimum standard. If Hudson is willing to take the order, even if the price is five hundred gold coins, there will still be a group of people rushing to invite him.</p>
<p>   There is no other reason, just because he, a sharpshooter, can break through armor and kill plate cavalry, which is enough to deter those guys in the Northland.</p>
<p>   Perhaps a large-scale cavalry charge could not be stopped, but in the face of 30 to 50 heavy cavalry, half of them could be knocked out before the opponent rushed over. It won't take long before the opponent can be wiped out on the battlefield.</p>
<p>   It's just that this kind of **** life is not what the peace-loving Hudson wants. No matter how high the external bid was, Master Hudson remained unmoved.</p>
<p>  He doesn't need to go out to take orders, but the value of the appearance fee has not decreased. Now that he personally received the customer, this fee must be included in the cost of sales.</p>
<p>  Based on the minimum of 200 gold coins per appearance, if a single business cannot earn 200 to 300 gold coins, it is considered a loss-making business.</p>
<p>  Under the background of soaring prices and it is not suitable to further increase the unit price of commodities, Hudson can only play bundled sales, and seek excess returns by increasing the transaction amount of the contract.</p>
<p>   Rubbing his forehead speechlessly, Baron Kettley reassured that this was a profiteer, not a nobleman.</p>
<p>  If possible, he really wants to turn around and leave, not to be exploited by profiteers here.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that there is only one seller now. Even if scattered farm tools can be bought outside, there is a high probability that they will be wholesaled from here. He has no more choices at all.</p>
<p>   "Then trouble Baron Hudson to lead the way ahead!"</p>
