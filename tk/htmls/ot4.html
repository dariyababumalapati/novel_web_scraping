     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After a series of bargaining, the Near East Defense Line plan was finally approved. As expected, Hudson's territory became the core of the defense line.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The geographical location is secondary. The key is Hudson's reputation. If this nail is not removed, the orc army will not dare to advance rashly.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The battles that the expeditionary army had carried out deep into the Orc Steppes had fundamentally changed the mode of warfare, making everyone realize that war could actually be played this way!
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Even without any logistical support, the expeditionary corps was able to achieve remarkable results. If it had the support of the Near East as a bridgehead, its power would be even greater.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In this context, the first city the kingdom started building was very obvious - the port!
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If there are conditions, we must go ahead. If there are no conditions, we must create them. The greatest feature of the extraordinary world is that human power can transform nature.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Theoretically, deserts can be turned into oases, wildernesses can be turned into fertile land, and mountains can be turned into plains. It is just a matter of the amount of investment.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, this is only in theory. Reversing the laws of nature is not as simple as it seems.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If a desert turns into an oasis, it will soon degenerate into a desert again unless the local climate can be drastically changed.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      To turn a wilderness into fertile land, not only does the climate have to keep up, but you also have to know how to nurture the land. Otherwise, once the fertility of the land is exhausted, it will become barren again.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Relatively speaking, the backlash from artificial ports is minimal. As long as no major changes occur, there will be no major problems for a hundred or eighty years.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, the construction of the port still needs to wait for on-site investigation before the specific location can be determined.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      All things are difficult at the beginning. As long as the construction of the first port is completed, subsequent work can rely on the port and slowly expand outward.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The plan was perfect, but the execution was very difficult. The most difficult problem was still people.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The Near East Defense Plan did put many nobles at ease, but it did not mean that everyone was willing to go there to open up new land.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The construction of the defense line takes time. Before the defense line is completed, what can guarantee the safety of everyone's territory?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The so-called security of the kingdom only means that the orcs will not invade on a large scale in the short term.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It was inevitable that a group of orc cavalry would stray into the enemy's territory occasionally. The enemy would not be so stupid as to watch the Alpha Kingdom take root in the Near East.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, there is nothing in the Near East now, so it is definitely safe. If the orcs want to come and plunder, it will be after next autumn.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If the kingdom's development progress is slow, perhaps the time of looting can be pushed back two or three years, or three to five years.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      With the joint efforts of all the elders, the newly emerged nobles were naturally no match. They were soon stunned by the various favorable conditions promised by the kingdom and accepted the canonization without knowing why.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After seeing this scene, Hudson realized that this group of nobles were really cruel. When they tried to deceive people, they even spared no effort on their own family members.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      What worries us is not the scarcity but the inequality; what worries us is not the poverty but the instability.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      First, Marshal Hudson accepted the fiefdom in the Near East, and then a group of children of great nobles followed suit. Naturally, the small and medium-sized nobles, who had information asymmetry, could only follow the crowd.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Each of them was immersed in the preferential policies promised by the kingdom, and regarded this enthronement as an opportunity, fantasizing that they were the new chosen son of God and would soar to the top in the Near East.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Some sober nobles realized the risks, but unfortunately they were powerless and refusing the reward was tantamount to giving up the fiefdom.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Everyone has a sense of luck. No matter how high the risk is, there is still a possibility of success. With so many nobles going together, they cannot all be wiped out.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If you are lucky enough to hold on, you will make a lot of money. After all, the kingdom is really generous this time, and the area of ​​the fiefdom is not ordinary.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      A knight's territory is granted fiefdom according to the specifications of a baron's territory, a baron's territory is granted fiefdom according to the specifications of a viscount's territory, and a viscount's territory is granted fiefdom according to the specifications of an earl's territory.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Above him is the newly-minted Duke of Snow Moon—Marshal Hudson, whose fiefdom is the largest in the country, making him the second largest landowner after the royal family.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      There were no actual earls, mainly a few powerful middle-class nobles in the kingdom who had arrived in the northern border several years ago.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The remaining middle-class nobles were limited by their own strength and were not qualified to participate in the chess game even if they wanted to give it a try.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Unlike the inland areas, the nobles in the border areas place more importance on obligations than benefits.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Taxation is simply nonsense. According to the conditions promised by the kingdom, the Near East will be tax-free for 30 years.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      We will all fight side by side on the battlefield. Don't expect to get any benefits from your younger brothers, otherwise you will be attacked from behind.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Apart from a higher political voice, there is little economic benefit, but the obligations are no less.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If the orcs attack, the governor will take his subordinates to the battlefield and fight the enemy with real guns and swords.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The minimum standard is to hold on until the kingdom’s reinforcements arrive, otherwise you’ll have to be loyal to your country!
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Without sufficient power at hand, he couldn't even command the nobles in the province, let alone fulfill his obligations.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The sons of great nobles are qualified to compete for the position of governor, but the families behind them do not support them!
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It's not that they don't want to support it, but after Hudson took away a large area, the remaining areas were divided into provinces, and there was more than one son of a great noble family in each province.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If you want to get to the top, you must spend a lot of money. Don't just do it casually and hurt yourself and others.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      At the Kingdom Conference, everyone clearly defined the standard that the governor of a province in the Near East must maintain a standing army of at least 8,000 men, including two eighth-level warriors and eight seventh-level warriors.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      I'm not being deliberate and making things difficult for you. A governor without this kind of strength might have his head chopped off by orcs at any time on the front line.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The middle and lower class nobles could die at will, but if the great nobles died so casually, how would the kingdom save its reputation?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If the kingdom sends troops to retaliate, the country will not be able to sustain the strength; if it does not retaliate, the kingdom's weak nature will be exposed and will attract more attention.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      There may be exceptions. If the governor himself is a powerful person in the Sanctuary, or if there is a powerful person in the Sanctuary accompanying the army, these restrictions will be lifted.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      There is nothing wrong with it. The exception clause is tailor-made for Hudson. Without this backdoor, where can the weak Koslo family find so many seventh and eighth level strongmen?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As a result, among the newly established seven provinces of the Near East, only the super-large province of Hudson had a governor, and the remaining six provinces were vacant.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Caesar IV nominated the sons of great nobles to serve as governors several times, but they were all rejected. There was no other reason, it was too risky to send so many military forces to the Near East.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Some of the weaker nobles had to add up all their assets to meet the standards, which meant they had to relocate their entire clan.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The kingdom has high standards and the compensation is not small. In the past, the decree of enthronement was issued, and the tax exemption for a few years was done, but now it also comes with population support.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The knights provided support of 500 people, the barons provided support of 1,500 people, the viscounts provided support of 4,500 people, the earls provided support of 15,000 people, and the Dukedom of Hudson directly received 100,000 people.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Not surprisingly, these people were refugees taken in by the kingdom.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The fall of a number of small countries in the Northern and Central Continents not only benefited the countries in the Southern Continent, but the Alpha Kingdom was also a beneficiary.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      A large number of refugees poured in, and in addition to the nobles who were recruiting people, the royal government was also busy.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The few people provided by the Kingdom of Light are naturally not enough to develop the Near East, but for the grassroots nobles, this is already a rare asset.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If I call on my friends and recruit some people to come over, I can set up the initial framework of the territory. I can slowly figure out the remaining problems.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Whenever there was a major war, slave traders were most active. These guys, who valued money over their lives, took action early on.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Unfortunately, very few people were able to make fortunes from this war. Apart from the expeditionary corps, the rest of the nobles who fought on their home soil were basically working for nothing.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Without money in your pocket, you naturally can’t buy anything. This wave of competition is all about family background. The richer the family behind you, the greater the support you give, and the stronger the power in your hands.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The children of the impoverished nobles were miserable, and they could only rely on their own efforts for everything. Not to mention development, just how to feed the people was even more worrying for them.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If nothing unexpected happens, they will be the "contractors" for a long time in the future, fighting on the front lines of construction with the people assigned to them by the kingdom.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The elders above had planned out the way forward for them. They could either accept the kingdom's employment to build defenses, or work for wealthy nobles to build castles.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After accumulating a certain amount of wealth, they would go back to build their own castle. If the relationship between them was handled well, they could also rely on the neighbors and borrow their houses to live for a few decades.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In border areas, this kind of situation of banding together for warmth is all too common.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If they do not know how to unite, individual knight territories and baron territories will not be able to withstand the harm caused by orcs.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      …
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "What, establish a new church?"
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Upon hearing the news, Hudson almost cursed on the spot. He had no objection to rebelling against the Vatican, but that also depended on the timing!
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The kingdom is busy dealing with issues in the Near East. In the next few years, its strategic focus will be on the Near East defense line, so it has no time to make trouble with the Vatican.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Although Hudson did not think that the Holy See, whose naval strength had been greatly weakened, would have the courage to send its fleet north to cause trouble for the kingdom, there was no need to rush out and attract hatred.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Your Majesty, which idiot came up with this plan? Doesn't he know that the kingdom shouldn't be involved in any extraneous matters right now?"
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Hudson responded bluntly.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      No matter who proposed it, he was definitely against it. If the kingdom insisted on having its own way, then there was no need to go to the fiefdoms in the Near East, and they could just go back to their fiefdoms and live a quiet life.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Marshal, this is none of our business. It was the Franks who proposed this plan. Although we have made an independence plan, we are not ready to launch it now."
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Archbishop Terran on the side hurriedly explained.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      He wanted to be the Pope, but that was also for the development of the kingdom. If the development of the kingdom was delayed by establishing a new church, it would be putting the cart before the horse.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

      In essence, the Church is both a faith and a business. In addition to the "tithe" that is openly displayed, the Church has many other ways to make money through faith.

    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Every year, a large number of believers donated wealth to the Church and purchased indulgences. Even though the Alpha Kingdom and the Church were at odds, it did not prevent the Church from sucking blood from the Kingdom.

     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After hearing that it was not done by his family, Hudson's face looked much better, and the expressions of the nobles present also relaxed.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Even if it was proposed by the Franks, we must reject it. At least before the kingdom has established a firm foothold in the Near East, it is not advisable to cause trouble!"
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The words of the Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, were clearly telling everyone implicitly that he was also unaware of this matter and was firmly opposed to it.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Hudson understood the inside story in an instant: the royal family had not reached a consensus on the issue of establishing a separate church.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It was obvious that the scepter of honor he had given before, although it had stimulated the ambitions of many people, did not make these powerful veterans of the two dynasties lose themselves.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      With the Prime Minister leading the opposition, Hudson would naturally not intervene. In any case, a proposal that could not even unify the position within the royal family would basically have no chance of passing in the Kingdom Parliament.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      “Your Excellency, Prime Minister, you are aware of the secret agreement between us and the Kingdom of Frank.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      According to the previous agreement, when one party stands up against the Holy See, the other party must provide unconditional and full support.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In the past, the Kingdom has faced the Holy See many times, and in the end, it was always able to end safely. In addition to our own strength, the support of our allies is also a core factor. "
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Archbishop Tyron's words made the Grand Duke of Newfoundland hesitate. The secret agreement was indeed not binding, but it involved the country's credibility.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The Holy See is not easy to mess with, and the continent's first kingdom is no pushover either. Judging from the current development momentum, it is only a matter of time before the Frankish Kingdom surpasses the Holy See.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Your Majesty, I think everyone present has the right to know the specific contents of the secret agreement!"
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Duke Hiro said unhappily.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The continental war had just ended, but the tension between the royal family and the five major families in the north was becoming increasingly intense.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      What started as a dispute over tolls gradually escalated into a matter of family reputation, putting them in a difficult position.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It's not impossible to give face to the royal family, but that must be communicated privately. How can we just send people to attack them directly?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If this precedent is set and the nobles in the Northern Frontier use their connections to put pressure on them, will they still have to make concessions?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If they took this step backwards, they would not be able to collect tolls in the future. Not only would the nobles not pay, but even the merchants would choose to rely on the nobles and refuse to pay taxes.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, as an important part of territory taxation, transit tax is a common rule in the continent of Aslant, and the lord sets his own collection standards.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It's just that they were a little greedy before, and relying on their monopoly advantage, they set the tax rate a little higher.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      This "high" is still relative to the outside world. The five major families in the North do not think it is high.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The original collection standard was 70%, but now it has been reduced to 30% to give face to everyone, which is already very generous.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Compared with five years ago, the transit tax revenues of several of them have been halved and then halved again.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, the high taxes in the past were mainly because these goods were smuggled into the Orc Empire, which itself had a very high profit premium.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It is not impossible for the final selling price to increase several times or even dozens of times. Even if the tax is very high, it is still a highly profitable business.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Now that the target of the harvest has changed, the situation has changed. The five major families in the north have been forced into a corner and can only hold on.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      At such a critical moment, the weaker you show, the more the enemy will take advantage of you.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      We are all shareholders of the kingdom, so if we want to make trouble, let us do so. As long as we act within the rules, the royal family can't do anything to us.

      "Your Excellency the Duke, the secret agreement was made under pressure from the Holy See. All the clauses are aimed at the Holy See and do not involve the interests of everyone.

   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Captain of the Guards, go get the secret agreement immediately and show it to all the ministers!"

      Caesar IV explained with a gloomy expression.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The king must also abide by the rules of the political game. The five major families in the north are an eyesore, but unfortunately he can never find a way in.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As great nobles of the kingdom, they could not be touched even if ordinary crimes were put upon them.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Unless it involves serious crimes such as regicide and treason, it will at most cause some disgust, but it will not hurt their vitality at all.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After the contents of the secret agreement were circulated over a cup of tea, the turmoil came to an end.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The secret agreement was signed by Caesar III back then, and it did not involve the interests of any party, so it is understandable that no high-level meeting was held.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In fact, during the reign of Caesar III, this kind of skirting the law was also done a lot. However, the prestige of this lord of the kingdom's revival was too high, so it was difficult for people to delve into it.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If Caesar IV had made a secret agreement with the outside world in private, I guess there would be a huge uproar here. It would not be surprising even if some nobles pointed their fingers at him and cursed him.

   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If you haven't done it, it only proves that you are incompetent, weak, and have no say in the kingdom.

   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As long as you have the evidence, just go for it. There is no need to worry too much, as the nature of the quarrels between shareholders at the shareholders' meeting is similar.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

      The princes openly challenged the king to a battle and defeated the king's army, which happened in the history of the continent of Aslant.

   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom were not that tough. At most, they would just engage in verbal battles, but they rarely engaged in actual combat.

      Insulting the Holy See is nothing new. If people start a war just because of a few insults, it will probably take less than a year for the Holy See to punish all human countries.
