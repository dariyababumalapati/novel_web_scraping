    Chapter 7 War is Coming
   </p>
   <p>
    In the evening, an urgent letter broke the tranquility of the castle.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Skull and Bones Society launched a rebellion in Dardir City, and many nobles, including Viscount Alphonse, were slaughtered. The governor of the southeastern province, Count Pierce, was furious and ordered the nobles in the province to be recruited to counter the rebellion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sequelae of news being blocked broke out at this moment. Obviously, the Skull and Bones rebellion happened for more than a month, but the Koslow family knew nothing about it.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the call-up orders in hand, Baron Redman didn't know the situation on the front line, so he could only passively accept the orders.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, you can know the severity of the situation without intelligence. If it is an ordinary rebellion, the surrounding lords will be strangled together, and there is no need for the entire province to be recruited.
   </p>
   <p>
    One baronie recruited 500 people. The last mobilization of this intensity was the orc invasion a hundred years ago, but that was based on the premise of preparation in advance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now that such an order is issued, in Hudson's opinion, Earl Pierce is most likely to be overwhelmed by the collapse of the situation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The army doesn't mean that the larger the number, the stronger it is. An army composed of 500 untrained serfs is not as effective as the castle guards.
   </p>
   <p>
    Especially the time left for everyone to prepare is only three days, which is the biggest failure. Regardless of other things, weapons, armor, food and grass must be prepared, right?
   </p>
   <p>
    This kind of purely voluntary recruitment, the boss is not responsible for the food, the food, grass, and supplies are all raised by everyone, so it is strange that the subordinates have no grievances.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The situation is urgent, Hudson, what do you think of this call?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Baron Redman asked with a headache.
   </p>
   <p>
    The two older sons are away, and now they are in trouble, so they have to pull Hudson, who seems to have a bit of military talent, to make up the numbers.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for other people in the territory, it is a pity that Baron Redman is a traditional nobleman and has no habit of discussing with commoners.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Father, the situation is still unclear, and it is not appropriate to join the main force of the family in the war.
   </p>
   <p>
    The call-up order only requires 500 troops, so 500 young men will be selected for a little training, and the call-up will be completed. "
   </p>
   <p>
    Hudson replied cautiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite the fact that there is only a guard team of dozens of people in his family, Baron Redman has accumulated decades of wealth.
   </p>
   <p>
    In comparison, the serf army is worthless. Even if it loses a few hundred people, it will not be able to shake the foundation of its own rule.
   </p>
   <p>
    For nobles, war is not all bad, at least it can consume excess population.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, Dadir City is one of the largest cities in the southeastern province. The strength of the local nobles is not weak, but they were taken over by the rebels. Naturally, things will not be simple.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's a pity that I received the information too late. If I had prepared earlier and trained an elite team, maybe your noble title would have been secured. "
   </p>
   <p>
    Baron Redman said regretfully.
   </p>
   <p>
    Opportunities presented themselves, but they could not be grasped because they were not fully prepared. This is obviously a tragedy in the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, this is just a moment of emotion. If Baron Redman really puts it all together, he may not be able to do it.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the final analysis, the Koslow family already wears shoes. Even if the shoes are not so comfortable, it is difficult to make up their minds to gamble.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Father, don't be sad. There is never a lack of opportunities in this world. Even if there are no opportunities, opportunities can be created. The key lies in strength.
   </p>
   <p>
    There should be quite a few people staring at this rebellion. The rebel army can grow rapidly, and I am afraid there must be someone behind it to fuel the flames.
   </p>
   <p>
    With our strength, even if we make great achievements on the battlefield, at most we will be assigned one or two knight leaders.
   </p>
   <p>
    This Earl Pierce is not very good at eating, and it is not easy to follow him to get ahead. "
   </p>
   <p>
    Hudson said with a sneer.
   </p>
   <p>
    He has never killed a pig himself, and he has seen pigs run.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rebellion broke out for more than a month. Not only did no army be organized to suppress the rebellion, but even the news did not spread. If there was no deliberate indulgence by Earl Pierce behind it, it would have been impossible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everyone is innocent, but pregnant is guilty.
   </p>
   <p>
    The inheritance left by the extinct nobles has obviously been targeted long ago. Only limited by the rules of the game, there is no way to "big fish eat small fish".
   </p>
   <p>
    The Skull and Bones rebellion just happened at the right time, and it just gave these guys a chance. In this context, how dare Hudson take food from the tiger's mouth?
   </p>
   <p>
    "You don't like Earl Pierce?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Baron Redman asked suspiciously.
   </p>
   <p>
    After several months of getting along, he has long discovered that Hudson is not a thing in the pool. As for the mediocrity in the past, in his opinion, it was deliberately hiding his clumsiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all, Hudson is only the third son in the family. If he behaves too outstandingly, not only the stepmother will find it difficult, but even the eldest son will dislike him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now that I have to go out and set up my own family, these problems are no longer a problem, and it is also necessary to show my talents and win family resources.
   </p>
   <p>
    I don’t know what Cheapy’s father thinks. Anyway, Hudson’s power to speak in the mansion has increased a lot recently, which is reflected in the late-night discussion with Baron Redman.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The hearts of the people are scattered, and the team is not easy to lead.
   </p>
   <p>
    Earl Pierce's plan seems to be very perfect, and the skill of killing people with borrowed knives is so perfect that people can't grasp it. But the world of nobility, why does it need evidence?
   </p>
   <p>
    The most simple logic: Whoever is the biggest beneficiary is behind the scenes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even if they can grab the fattest meat this time, it is rare to be the earls of the kingdom's twelve fiefdoms, how much strength can they increase?
   </p>
   <p>
    For this benefit, it is not worth the loss to arouse the hostility of the nobles under his command.
   </p>
   <p>
    You must know that among the nobles who were exterminated, many of them were their vassals. I dare not serve such a master. "
   </p>
   <p>
    Hudson said mockingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is a professional. I think when I was a keyboard man, I sprayed everything.
   </p>
   <p>
    No matter what it is, as long as you want to complain, you can find a bunch of reasons.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now playing with these, there is only one purpose - to fool Baron Redman into paddling in the next war.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although it is somewhat immoral, it is better than safety!
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyway, I am not a vassal of Earl Pierce, so I have no obligation to work for him. Even if they accept the call, they still have a high degree of autonomy.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Got it, I'll think about it again."
   </p>
   <p>
    Baron Redman said hesitantly.
   </p>
   <p>
    No matter what kind of person Earl Pierce is, and no matter what his future will be, he is still the boss of the southeastern province.
   </p>
   <p>
    It still takes courage to be obedient and obedient under the eyes of the boss. Unless there is collective resistance from the small and medium nobles, the rafters that stand alone will most likely rot first.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Father, why don't I lead the army this time? You are in charge of the territory, and there is room for maneuver if something happens.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all, the recruitment is too urgent this time, and it is estimated that everyone will not have time to prepare.
   </p>
   <p>
    As long as the serfs are trained a little bit, and they form an army that can be seen, they can handle it by mixing in the big team. "
   </p>
   <p>
    Hudson pretended to be confident and said.
   </p>
