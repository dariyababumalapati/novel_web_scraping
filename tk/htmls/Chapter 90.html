<p>  As soon as Hudson finished speaking, Baron Kettley wanted to die. But it's not about committing suicide, it's about killing the vampire in front of him.</p>
<p>   It was just the unfamiliar surroundings that made him let go of this tempting idea. Turning your face on someone else's territory is definitely looking for a beating.</p>
<p>  "This is impossible!</p>
<p>   Baron Hudson, your appetite is too big. I just need a batch of emergency food, you are digging my roots! "</p>
<p>  As soon as he got up and was about to leave, Baron Kettley regretted it. Half of the population is not negotiable, as long as there is enough food in exchange, then everything is not a problem.</p>
<p>   After all, losses can also be passed on. Now all the nobles in the north are short of food, and it is not impossible to exchange population for food.</p>
<p>  To go or not to go?</p>
<p>   After hesitating for a moment, Baron Kettler sat back down again. Although face is important, survival is even more important.</p>
<p>  Going south from the north, he has placed all the chips. If you can't gain a firm foothold in the maple leaf collar, all your efforts will be in vain.</p>
<p>  Family resources are limited, and it is impossible to continue investing in losers. If he failed once, he would have to work for the family to pay off the debts all his life, just like the Holman knight who followed him.</p>
<p>   "Your Excellency, don't refuse in a hurry, listen to my offer first. One hundred and fifty thousand pounds of rye + two hundred thousand pounds of miscellaneous grains, for the sake of old friends, you can also give an extra ten iron pots.</p>
<p>  If there is a similar business, you can also introduce it to me, and you can get 10% of the benefits. "</p>
<p>  Hudson said "old friend" one by one, which made Baron Kettley's scalp tingle when he heard these three words.</p>
<p>  The so-called friendship is worth ten iron pots.</p>
<p>   But thinking about the relationship between the two, it seems that it would be good to discount it into ten iron pots.</p>
<p>   As for introducing business, Baron Kettley ignored it. This kind of **** business, no matter who it is introduced to, is an offending business.</p>
<p>  Just 10% of the income is not enough to make him let go of his prejudices and attract customers for the vampire in front of him.</p>
<p>   "Dear Baron Hudson, such a price is simply a steal!"</p>
<p>  Kately suppressed his anger and said.</p>
<p>  On average, each labor force can only be exchanged for more than 100 pounds of grain, most of which are miscellaneous grains. In normal times, the price would never exceed 3 silver coins.</p>
<p>   "Your Excellency, don't rush to get angry. The most important thing in a person is contentment. Only when you learn contentment can you have a good mood.</p>
<p>  Looking at it another way, this is a costless business. Now that half of the population can be left, and so much extra food can be exchanged, what is there to be dissatisfied with?</p>
<p>   Don't forget the current situation, Governor Pierce is coming to mediate. The things you have done before are not impeccable.</p>
<p>  As long as you dig into it, you will definitely find omissions. Among other things, you can't give a reasonable explanation for the population alone!</p>
<p>  Don't say more than 6,000 people, even if you cut half of it, you can handle it, it's considered luck.</p>
<p>   The explanation is not clear, when the time comes to investigate, can you really keep so many people?</p>
<p>   Rather than being forcibly confiscated by the Governor's Mansion, it is better to trade them out in advance, at least to get a batch of grain. "</p>
<p>   Hudson said with a smile.</p>
<p>   Killing people is also a technical job. Although his words are alarmist, the intervention of the Governor's Office is indeed very detrimental to the nobles of northern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>  When my younger brother is being bullied, it is self-evident which side the boss will stand on. It's fine if you can't catch the handle. Once the problem is found out, Earl Pierce will most likely be severely punished.</p>
<p>  Looking at Hudson, knowing that this is the final bid and not negotiating with him, Kettley sighed helplessly.</p>
<p>   "That's all, just do as Your Excellency the Baron says. But I don't want any accidents to happen next!"</p>
<p>   While speaking, Baron Kettley's heart was bleeding.</p>
<p>   Working for more than a month, he offended the neighbors all over the place. As a result, Hudson only paid "150,000 pounds of rye + 200,000 pounds of miscellaneous grains" and took half of the spoils.</p>
<p>   But he didn't even have the confidence to refuse, the food in the territory was about to run out, the serfs were croaking with hunger, and people fled every day.</p>
<p>  If food is no longer available, even the soldiers will have to starve.</p>
<p>   You can’t really go out and grab it, can you?</p>
<p>  The transaction can still save half of the population, and quickly replant some crops with a short growth cycle, so that the food in exchange can be saved and can last until the harvest.</p>
<p>   If you lead troops out to rob, the suffocation in your chest will come out. Once a rebellious hat is buckled, there will be no end to it.</p>
<p>   "Don't worry, Baron Kettley. My reputation is well-known throughout the southeastern province, and nothing that will damage the honor of the nobility will definitely happen."</p>
<p>   Hudson assured calmly.</p>
<p>   In terms of credibility, he is indeed impeccable. Just ask those nobles who have worked with you, and there is nothing bad to say.</p>
<p>   Now is the time to reap the rewards. Lord Kettley would not have come to him without a good reputation.</p>
<p>  The deal was concluded and Hudson was still a little disappointed as he watched Baron Kettley leave.</p>
<p>   Originally wanted to take the opportunity to sell some by-products, but Baron Kettley's temper was too eager, and he left immediately after talking about the matter, unwilling to stay for a moment.</p>
<p>  However, there is no rush for this kind of thing. It is not worth rushing to the door to do business in an exclusive monopoly business.</p>
<p>  In the two counties of Wright and Wyton, his family can produce ironware on a large scale. Looking at the entire southeastern province, Hudson is also the largest supplier of ironware.</p>
<p>  The era of lords everywhere is not suitable for the development of commercial logistics. The endless tolls along the way alone can block foreign goods out of the door.</p>
<p>   It is normal for the price of the same product to vary several times in different regions.</p>
<p>   It’s no wonder that the nobles exploited so hard, it was all stimulated by the tax package system. The governor is responsible for the taxation of the whole province, the sheriff is responsible for the taxation of the whole county, and the noble lords below are responsible for the taxation of their own territories.</p>
<p>  Whether you entrust it to others or collect it yourself, anyway, after making up the figure stipulated by the kingdom, the proceeds will be yours. If you can't complete the expropriation task, you can only fill the hole with your own money.</p>
<p>  The aristocrats in remote areas are poor, largely because there is no commercial tax to collect in the territory, and there are no free people to exploit.</p>
<p>  Of course, losing money is a small probability event. Although the tax package system is implemented, the tax standards of each region are formulated according to the actual local conditions.</p>
<p>  For example: Wright and Wyton counties encountered the Skull and Bones rebellion, and they were tossed out of ten rooms. The kingdom exempted the tax for the past three years, and it will also be able to reduce taxes in different amounts in the next ten years.</p>
<p>   These are gradually perfected after a long period of games between the kingdom and the local nobles. Maybe there are some areas that take advantage of losses, but on the whole, the interests of all parties are taken into account.</p>
<p>  Everyone is a shareholder and enjoys the dividends of the kingdom's development. As for the other classes in the kingdom, they are all laborers who depend on the nobles to survive.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Canglan City, Emerald Palace.</p>
<p>   "What did you say? Earl Frodo, was attacked outside the city of Rockdia, and none of the entire mission survived?"</p>
<p>  Caesar III asked almost roaringly.</p>
<p>  As the king's envoy, Earl Frodo represented the royal power outside, and now he was killed in the kingdom like this, which is clearly a provocation to the royal power.</p>
<p>  This kind of thing cannot be tolerated by any monarch, let alone a promising lord like Caesar III.</p>
<p>   "Yes, Your Majesty.</p>
<p>  The location where Earl Frodo was attacked was twenty miles outside the city of Rockdia. By the time the nearby nobles rushed to the rescue, the battle was over.</p>
<p>  Although the enemy destroyed the scene, we still found some dragon feces during the investigation around the battlefield.</p>
<p>  On the mainland, there are only a few forces organized by flying dragon cavalry, and the only one that has entered the kingdom recently is the second flying dragon cavalry regiment under the Holy See Judgment Knights.</p>
<p>  According to the news from the inside of the Holy See, their mission this time is to take away the Blood Moon Horn at all costs.</p>
<p>   It is very likely that after Earl Frodo obtained the Horn of the Blood Moon, he accidentally leaked the news, making them choose to take the risk. "</p>
<p>  The Grand Duke of Newfoundland analyzed solemnly.</p>
<p>   As the prime minister of the kingdom, he is old. Now I just want to spend the rest of my term safely, but I didn't expect trouble to come to my door.</p>
<p>  The Holy See intercepted and killed the king's special envoy. If the Alpha Kingdom didn't respond, how would they be able to hang out in the continent of Aslant?</p>
<p>  Once the Kingdom takes retaliation, the already tense relationship with the Holy See may be completely over, and it may lead to a war.</p>
<p>  Of course, the Alpha Kingdom is not afraid of war with the Holy See.</p>
<p>  As the patron saint of the human race, the Alpha Kingdom, which has stood on the front line against the orcs for many years, is not weak. Even if the strength is not as good as the Holy See, the gap between the two sides is not so huge.</p>
<p>  As a big force, everyone has their own concerns, and no one wants to be taken advantage of by others.</p>
<p>   What's more, there are several countries in between. Even if the Holy See wants to call, they have to ask others to borrow their way.</p>
<p>   There is no doubt that this cannot happen. The countries on the mainland still need the Alpha Kingdom to block the orcs' advance, and they will not let the Holy See fight over at all.</p>
<p>  There are many reliance on it, so the Alpha Kingdom has always been known for its toughness when it comes to dealing with the Holy See. To be exact, the Alpha Kingdom has never been soft on any side.</p>
<p>   "Send someone to stop the flying dragon cavalry of the Holy See. Before the matter is investigated clearly, the Kingdom prohibits any member of the Holy See from entering or leaving. Anyone who resists will be killed!</p>
<p>   Send an order to freeze all the property of the Holy See in the kingdom, and deal with it after the matter is investigated. "</p>
<p>   Caesar III ordered indifferently.</p>
<p>   Obviously, he was really irritated. The matter of the blood moon horn has not yet been settled with the Holy See, and now there is another incident of intercepting and killing the special envoy, which clearly does not take the Alpha Kingdom seriously.</p>
<p>   If the matter is verified, no one knows what will happen next.</p>
<p>   "Your Majesty, it is reasonable to detain the flying dragon cavalry, but is it an overreaction to freeze the Holy See's property?"</p>
<p>  The Grand Duke of Newfoundland hastily persuaded.</p>
<p>   The dispute between kingship and theocracy has not been a day or two, but everyone has always maintained the principle of fighting without breaking.</p>
<p>  Even if countries have separated their domestic churches from the Holy See, they have nominally retained their affiliation with the Holy See.</p>
<p>   "Excessive?"</p>
<p>   "I don't see it that way!"</p>
<p>   "The guys in Northern Xinjiang have become restless recently. They are jumping up and down and stretching out their hands, and they are not afraid that the next time the orcs invade, the nobles from all over the place will stab them with knives.</p>
<p>  Compared to the internal conflicts in the kingdom, the Holy See is not a threat. It's just a temporary freeze of their property, and it's not directly confiscated, but at worst it's a war of words.</p>
<p>   Just because they supported the cult to launch a rebellion, Pius VII did not have the confidence to bring it to the table. If the matter of intercepting and killing the nobles of my Alpha Kingdom is real, do you think the Holy See really dares to let go and make trouble with us? "</p>
<p>  The quickest way to divert internal conflicts is always to provoke external disputes. The Alpha Kingdom is professional in this regard, and Caesar III is an expert among them.</p>
<p>   "Your Majesty, there have been frequent changes on the orc side recently. It may be related to the end of Emperor Bimon's lifespan. After all, that old guy is about to turn 300 years old.</p>
<p>  Although the Behemoth family lived longer than our human race, there are still very few Behemoths who can live to this age in history.</p>
<p>  According to the past practice, after succeeding to the throne, the successive emperors of Bimon would launch a southward invasion to eliminate dissidents and consolidate the imperial power through war.</p>
<p>   Those guys in Northern Xinjiang jumped up and down, probably aware of something, and wanted to transfer some of their strength before the outbreak of the war. "</p>
<p>   Minister of Military Affairs, Grand Duke Efiero reminded.</p>
<p>   "Understood. The old man of the Orc Empire had rumors that his lifespan was about to expire before I succeeded to the throne. In the past few decades, there have been such incidents every few years.</p>
<p>   I really don’t know what kind of sorcery the Orc Empire has. Every time I think he is about to die, but after a while, he comes out alive and kicking.</p>
<p>   After tossing back and forth so many times, he killed three heirs. Now the crown prince is also very old, and there is a high probability that he will walk ahead of him again.</p>
<p>  The remaining youngest son is in a similar situation, both in their 150s and 60s. I heard that he was injured when he was young, and he might be gone someday.</p>
<p>  I don’t think this old son will succeed to the throne. The throne will most likely fall to one of his grandsons or great-grandsons.</p>
<p>  Let them make trouble, the orc empire is powerful, we can't control it anyway.</p>
<p>  As for those guys in Northern Xinjiang, send someone to warn them. The Kingdom has raised them for so many years, so how can they just shrink back! "</p>
<p>  Caesar III said indignantly.</p>
<p>  For the long-lived Emperor Bimon, all human monarchs can only envy and envy him. Three hundred years is really too long for the human race.</p>
<p>  Even if it is a strong man in the sanctuary of the human race, it is difficult to live beyond three hundred years. But in some long-lived groups, three hundred years old is just like playing.</p>
<p>  Although Bimon's lifespan is longer than that of human beings, it is also limited. If it were an elf, they would still be in their prime at three hundred years old.</p>
<p>   Not to mention the dragon race, whether they can reach adulthood at the age of three hundred depends on the species.</p>
<p>  As a self-cultivated king, he is only envious and jealous, and it is not enough for Caesar III to lose his composure and issue the most vicious curse.</p>
<p>   What really made him intolerable was that the royal family's foundation was taken away by this old and immortal Emperor Beamon.</p>
<p>  When he was young, Caesar III still wanted to take revenge, preparing to regain his ancestral land and avenge his shame.</p>
<p>   It's just that as he grows older and suffers more beatings from society, Caesar III's mind has also matured.</p>
<p>   Ideals only exist in theory after all. If they can be easily realized, they are no longer ideals.</p>
<p>   It is not a question of whether to work hard or not, but that the strength gap between the two sides is too great. Playing heads-up, the Alpha Kingdom really can't beat the orcs.</p>
<p>   Want to form gang fights, but other Terran nations are not active. There is still a lot of land available for development in the Aslant Continent. The bad land of the Orc Empire is not suitable for the survival of the human race, and it cannot mobilize everyone's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>   This is also the core reason why Caesar III, or the entire Alpha royal family, has always been unhappy with the five dukes of northern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>  Before the royal family's foundation was lost, if the nobles of the Northland provided reinforcements in time, there was still hope to keep it. It's a pity that under the leadership of the five major families, the reinforcements delayed their departure for two full days, which directly led to the complete collapse of the front line.</p>
<p>  After the war, the power of the royal family was greatly damaged. It was a fluke to be able to keep the royal power. It was really powerless to liquidate these guys, but the feud between the two sides was settled.</p>
<p>  Feng Shui turns, the guy who used to cheat his teammates has now become the character who is cheated by his teammates.</p>
<p>  The current five major families in the Northland have been set up by a group of teammates, and they are not given the opportunity to transfer their foundation at all, and they have no place to retreat if they want to retreat.</p>
<p>   Not only the Alpha Kingdom does not allow them to retreat, but the entire human race does not allow them to retreat.</p>
<p>   Everyone is very principled in this regard. If you dare to be a deserter when aliens invade, you will face the pursuit and killing of the entire human race.</p>
<p>  Of course, this principle is not only a constraint on the nobles of the North, but also a constraint on all the nobles of the Alpha Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The main reason is that the neighbors are afraid that the Alpha Kingdom will collapse again. After all, in the last continental war, two unlucky people were dragged into the water, and no one wants to be the third.</p>
<p>  So the countries joined forces in private and directly added such a clause to the "Continental Convention", completely putting on the table the sacred obligation of the feudal nobles to guard the land.</p>
<p>   "Your Majesty, the matter is not that serious. The guys in Beijiang are only a little more active, far from this level."</p>
<p>  The prime minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, hurriedly persuaded him.</p>
<p>  Some things can be thought of, but must not be said. It is just everyone's inference that the northern Xinjiang nobles want to transfer their foundation.</p>
<p>  It is pure nonsense to say they are going to run away. The foundations are all in northern Xinjiang, so can you leave your ancestral foundation and give up your current identity to run away?</p>
<p>  Don’t say that the orcs didn’t come over, even if they did, they could only grit their teeth and hold on.</p>
<p>  Since the establishment of the Alpha Kingdom, it has been entangled with the Orc Empire until now. Although he kept losing in heads-up, he had great summoning skills!</p>
<p>   "In the early stages of the duel, I was responsible for being beaten; in the mid-term reinforcements came, and the two sides began to fight back and forth; in the later stage, when there were more reinforcements, a full-scale counterattack was launched."</p>
<p>   This sequence has been repeated for hundreds of years, and everyone is used to it.</p>
<p>  If it weren’t for the fact that in the last continental war, the human race was besieged by more than a dozen races at the same time, facing multi-line battles, and the support from various countries was not as strong as before, King Alpha would not have lost his city or territory.</p>
<p>   Among them, there are also some big nobles deliberately holding back their legs, trying to pull the other two countries into the water and share the pressure together.</p>
<p>  Under the influence of many common factors, it suffered a big loss. Now that there are two more unlucky guys to share the pressure, it is more beneficial to the Alpha Kingdom strategically, so there is no need to be cowardly.</p>
<p>  Even if soldiers were lost in previous wars, most of the people who died in battle were middle and lower class nobles. As a real high-ranking member of the kingdom, although he occasionally fights, the probability of survival is very high.</p>
