Especially the warring parties were overwhelmed by this scene.</p>
<p>  The young aristocrat who took the shot was ashamed, holding the hammer in panic, not knowing what to do. Fighting is a trivial matter, and killing a nobleman is a disaster that will break the sky.</p>
<p>  Seeing that everyone's eyes were focused on the noble in the pool of blood, Hudson once had the idea of ​​​​abandoning the stall and taking advantage of the chaos.</p>
<p>  Anyway, he didn't start the fight, nor did he overthrow the people. It's just a hammer, as long as he escapes from the scene, he will be fine if he bites him to death and refuses to admit it.</p>
<p>   "What are you doing in a daze, why don't you hurry up and hire a pastor!"</p>
<p>   Hudson reprimanded everyone.</p>
<p>   Reason told him not to run, if he slipped away at this time, there would be **** behind him.</p>
<p>  The world of nobility is not only about evidence, but also about reputation. With a good reputation, it can be eaten no matter where it is.</p>
<p>  So many people present have seen it, and escaped responsibility, but they can't stop everyone's long talk!</p>
<p>   People don’t know whether they are dead, so they run away in a hurry. Isn’t it telling others that this matter has something to do with him.</p>
<p>  Instead of this, it is better to stay and deal with it actively. As the owner of the hammer, it would indeed be troublesome to be involved, but that was just trouble.</p>
<p>   Please pastor, indeed remind everyone. But this is a correct nonsense, pastors and gentlemen will not come here to eat dirt just after the war has subsided and the reconstruction work has just begun.</p>
<p>  According to the usual practice, the priest must move in only after the territory has a certain economic foundation and the church has been repaired.</p>
<p>   What level of priest is, it depends on the means of the lords. Generally speaking, the wealthier the territory, the more popular it is with priests.</p>
<p>  Because of the war, with Dadir City as the center, there was no trace of the priest for dozens of miles. When the priest was invited over, the corpse was probably completely cold.</p>
<p>   Rescue, just think about it. A group of bosses bandaged the wounds roughly and simply. This kind of head injury is really embarrassing.</p>
<p>   If the person is rescued, then everyone will be happy and gain a lot of favors; but if the person disappears during the rescue process, it will be embarrassing.</p>
<p>  If you can’t get favors, people might suspect that this is a deliberate murder. Human nature is the most vulnerable thing to test.</p>
<p>   As a strong talker, Hudson decisively chose to save people with his mouth.</p>
<p>   "The guy with the sledgehammer, hurry up and put down his weapon to rescue the wounded. If this kid on the ground dies, you almost have to confess."</p>
<p>  Whoever caused the disaster is responsible for the thunder. Based on the principle of not deceiving others, Hudson decisively left the task of treating the wounded to the perpetrator.</p>
<p>   "Oh me?"</p>
<p>   "But I can't save people!"</p>
<p>   While speaking, the young nobles surrounded by the crowd were about to cry.</p>
<p>   Fortunately, his subordinates were relatively strong. At the critical moment, a middle-aged soldier in shabby clothes came out.</p>
<p>   After all, he wasn't too stupid. After reacting from his panic, the young nobleman immediately contributed his clothes to serve as gauze to bind the wound.</p>
<p>  Intentional killing and accidental killing are not the same concept. The former has a high probability of paying for his life, and the latter can offer a set meal for the northern border defense after compensating the other party for a loss.</p>
<p>  Although the days of distribution to the frontier were bitter and dangerous, it was more comfortable to go to the northern border than to meet the Lord of the Dawn directly.</p>
<p>  As long as there is no large-scale invasion of orcs, the annual death rate of the border nobles usually does not exceed 5%. Among the guys who died in battle, more than half died in the process of slave hunting.</p>
<p>   "The Sith Baron is here!"</p>
<p>   I don't know who shouted, and the crowd gave way tacitly.</p>
<p>  Relevant person in charge +1, Hudson feels more at ease. With one more unlucky guy to accompany him, he wasn't too lonely.</p>
<p>   "Can any of you tell me what happened here?"</p>
<p>   Baron Sith asked helplessly.</p>
<p>  He has dealt with many similar situations, but this time the situation is more serious.</p>
<p>   Everyone, you look at me, I look at you, and I don't know when their eyes focused on Hudson. The expectant look in his eyes was obviously urging him to hurry up.</p>
<p>   There is no accident, and it is the dispute between the northern nobles and the local nobles. The Sith Baron can represent the northern nobles, and naturally there must be someone with a matching status among the local nobles.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, among the local nobles at the scene, Hudson is a little more famous.</p>
<p>  Although he belongs to the neutral camp, it does not prevent everyone from pushing him forward. After all, this kind of thing is often accompanied by a series of wrangling, if the representative is too weak, it will suffer a big loss.</p>
<p>   "Isn't the situation obvious? A group of people are here to engage in a fight, and they lose control of their emotions after fighting. Accidentally caused the current situation."</p>
<p>   Hudson said evasively.</p>
<p>  Status determines the position, even if he thinks the impulsive young nobleman in the middle should take the responsibility, but for the sake of belonging to the same local nobles, he still has to defend one or two points.</p>
<p>   "Things that are about to kill people, your Excellency just so lightly defines it as a fight, I'm afraid I can't explain it!"</p>
<p>  Sith said indifferently.</p>
<p>  Now his status is really embarrassing. On the one hand, he has to protect the interests of the noble camp in northern Xinjiang, and on the other hand, he has to maintain stability in the city.</p>
<p>   "There is no need to go into these details. With our current identities, you and I are not qualified to deal with this matter. Anyway, it doesn't matter if you talk about it. Why waste your words here!</p>
<p>  Protect the scene well. Your Excellency the Governor will arrive in Dadir City in a few days. When the time comes, report directly, and he will give a fair ruling. "</p>
<p>  Professional dumping, choking Sith to death. Reported to the governor's ruling, Hudson's affairs are over, but his troubles have just begun.</p>
<p>   Not to mention that as the host, he has no responsibility to maintain order, but his status as the leader of the nobles in northern Xinjiang requires him to continue to follow up.</p>
<p>   If there is no accident, the next time he is arguing with him will not be a small fish like Hudson, but a senior official of the Governor's Mansion.</p>
<p>  Instead of arguing with the officials in the Governor's Mansion, it is better to draw a conclusion on the matter now, at least to be able to control the initiative.</p>
<p>   "I didn't expect to be able to be a famous bow knight here, and let us meet on this occasion. But you defend this person so much, could it be..."</p>
<p>  Hidson was not surprised when his identity was found out. There is the iconic Earth Bear, and there are really few people who don't recognize his identity.</p>
<p>   It's just this kind of half-talking, which is the easiest way to make people think wildly, but it really disgusts him.</p>
<p>   "It doesn't matter if it's not or not. Baron Sith has the time to care about these details, so it's better to get someone to rescue the wounded.</p>
<p>   Based on your moral cultivation, even if this unlucky guy offended you before, he wouldn’t be willing to die now, would he? "</p>
<p>   Hudson replied unceremoniously.</p>
<p>  Since he dared to point the finger at him, no wonder he fought back.</p>
<p>  What surprised Hudson was that he didn't seem to have offended this person, but as soon as this guy saw his identity, he became very hostile towards him.</p>
<p>  Is there a conflict of interest between the two?</p>
<p>   It's possible, but it's all potential.</p>
<p>  The person in front of him doesn't look like a fool, does he?</p>
<p>  If there may be a potential conflict of interests, and it is necessary to be an enemy, then everyone in the world is an enemy.</p>
<p>  It is the same as choosing not to eat or drink if you may choke to death when you eat or drink water.</p>
<p>   I don't know the reason, and it doesn't prevent the two from conflicting. Everyone else handed out their knives, and Hudson would not hesitate.</p>
<p>  Although Baron Sith is the most powerful noble in the two counties, if they really match up, it doesn't matter who will suffer!</p>
<p>  Hudson doesn't think that all the northern Xinjiang nobles will really listen to his command. Even the retainers and children of the Felix family may not really take him as an illegitimate child seriously.</p>
<p>  The two fell into a stalemate, and the crowd of onlookers also divided into two waves. Looking at the expression eager to try, it seemed that they hoped that the two of them could do it here.</p>
<p>  Obviously, this is impossible. Fighting in other people's territory is definitely asking for trouble. Hudson is such a cautious master, he will definitely not choose violence to solve the problem.</p>
<p>   Baron Sith also didn’t dare to do anything. As the host, it’s fine if he can’t maintain order. If he leads people off the stage to fight with the guests, his reputation will really be bad.</p>
<p>   In fact, he regrets it now. Although it is suspected that Hudson has a connection with his competitor, but the account can be kept and settled slowly in the future, there is no need to turn his face at this time.</p>
<p>   Right now, the two stabbed each other with a knife, neither of them was able to get a bargain, and they were framed by each other.</p>
<p>  Continuing to fight like this, the two unlucky **** who had little to do with this fight, might be involved in it.</p>
<p>   "Don't worry about Baron Hudson. In order to avoid accidents, I have sent someone to invite the pastor."</p>
<p>  Sith said indifferently.</p>
<p>  Although this statement is true, it is only half the truth. He did invite the pastor early, but unfortunately, the benefactors behind these people are all local nobles, so they didn't buy his account at all.</p>
<p>   Finally met someone who accepted the invitation, but that guy's ancestors had a feud with the Felix family, so he was directly put together. He promised well, but there was no one there.</p>
<p>   "It's best to be so natural. Now that Baron Sith is ready, we can rest assured that the wounded will be handed over to you.</p>
<p>   Everyone, let’s go, just leave this place to Baron Sith, we don’t need to stay here to make trouble. "</p>
<p>   After finishing speaking, regardless of whether Baron Sith was willing to take over the mess, Hudson turned around and left without giving him a chance to refuse.</p>
<p>  The local nobles who reacted chose to keep up without hesitation. Those who lay down were the nobles of the Northland, and the hot potato was also thrown out, and they continued to stay as witnesses for the other party. Everyone is not that great yet.</p>
<p>  Anyway, people are still alive, so it is just a violent injury incident. If he dies in an accident and there is no local noble to witness, it will be a bad debt.</p>
<p>   Hudson, the spearhead, was arranged, and the wounded had a feud with Baron Sith. Regardless of whether it is true or not, the local nobles selectively believe that it is true.</p>
<p>  If the wounded dies unfortunately, then there are two suspects, and the debt is definitely bad.</p>
<p>  Of course, the fact that Baron Sith had a feud with the wounded was purely Hudson's nonsense and could not stand up to in-depth research. This bad debt is even more unfavorable to the middle-ranking nobleman who made the move.</p>
<p>   But no matter how bad the debt is, it is better than full responsibility. They all hang out in the same circle, and they are more or less passionate, so they have to take care of their own people.</p>
<p>  Even if you know the responsibilities of your own camp, at this critical moment, everyone can only help relatives and not help. This is the essence of staying together to keep warm.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  The carriage moved forward slowly, and just about to calm things down, I pressed down on the conflict between my younger brother and the noble children of Northern Xinjiang, but I didn't expect bad news to come again.</p>
<p>  The bustling Dadir City has finally reached the point where people are killed. Intuition told him that he couldn't delay on the road slowly.</p>
<p>  In case the conflict intensifies, a group of local noble children and northern Xinjiang noble children will collide in Dadir City. No matter who wins, it will be a tragedy that shocks the whole country.</p>
<p>  The scapegoat of this level cannot be carried by the small body below, and it will only be pinned on him, the governor.</p>
<p>   Without the slightest hesitation, Earl Pierce stepped onto his horse and set off in a hurry with a team of cavalry. As for the carriage and guard of honor, they can only follow slowly behind.</p>
<p>  Earl Pierce led the cavalry to finish the remaining 100 miles in less than three hours.</p>
<p>   It's just that the horses that got off the horse were all exhausted after running for hundreds of miles. If these war horses hadn't been stained with the blood of monsters, they would have been useless for playing.</p>
<p>  The angry boss arrived ahead of time, and the nobles who were too late to greet him were terrified besides panic.</p>
<p>  As one of the people involved, Hudson also complained secretly. Although the blame was given to Baron Sith, anyone with a discerning eye knew what was going on.</p>
<p>  Earl Pierce doesn't like the nobles of northern Xinjiang, but it doesn't mean he likes him. Although the old matter of refusing to solicit has not been mentioned, it does not mean that the matter is over.</p>
<p>   I haven't found him bad luck, mainly because of "political correctness". The halo of killing the Holy See cavalry has not completely dissipated, and Earl Pierce, who cherishes his feathers, will naturally not do anything to give others a handle.</p>
<p>  If there is a reasonable excuse, he can be taught a lesson. Hudson believes that this round of boards will definitely not be light.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Why don't you talk anymore, these days, you guys have done really well!</p>
<p>   First, they plundered and killed each other. If the large and small battles are added together, I am afraid that the civilian casualties will not be lower than four digits, right? The compassionate spirit of the nobles has been thrown out of the sky by you.</p>
<p>  These days have been even worse, from civilian casualties to nobles. Don't worry, only one nobleman died and twenty-three were injured.</p>
<p>  You can continue to fight, it is best to kill everyone who dislikes you, in the end you will be invincible, and the whole continent is yours!</p>
<p>  …”</p>
<p>   Being scolded, Hudson secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Experience told him that when something goes wrong, he is not afraid of being scolded by the leader, but he is afraid of being treated nicely by the leader.</p>
<p>   Being scolded means that there is still room for salvation. If the leader is kind and pleasant, he is ready to let you take the blame. It's a trivial matter to resign and leave, and you might be able to account for it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>   "Stupid Baron Sith, as the lord of Dadir City, so many field conflicts happened in your house, don't you have anything to say?</p>
<p>  If you are old and physically weak and unable to fulfill your lord's obligations, I can suggest that the kingdom be replaced by a lord in the prime of life.</p>
<p>  For example: Our Baron Hudson performed exceptionally well. Not only was it possible to arrive at the scene of the battle in time, organize manpower to treat the wounded, even the murder weapons used by others were also prepared.</p>
<p>  …”</p>
<p>   Hudson endured the sowing and dissension in front of him. Anyway, he matched up with Baron Sith, and he didn't care about adding a sum.</p>
<p>   But the last sentence is really too much. It was true to organize manpower to "rescue the wounded", but because the pastor failed to arrive in time, the people were still gone in the end.</p>
<p>   It's fine to be ridiculed, but it is really wrong to prepare the "weapon". Although he sold a lot of weapons during the conflict in the city, it was just a normal sale.</p>
<p>  What people do with their own weapons is the freedom of others, and he has no right to interfere at all.</p>
<p>  Hudson admitted that he had made money from the war, especially after the sledgehammer incident, the sledgehammer produced by his family was particularly popular.</p>
<p>   Not only the spot stock was sold out, but even the production order was pushed to a month later. But these are all business, there is absolutely no "weapon".</p>
<p>   It is impossible to justify. Even the tough-headed Baron Sith obediently listened to the training, and Hudson didn't dare to stand up.</p>
<p>   If you scold, you can scold, anyway, you won't lose a piece of meat. Accounts are kept first, and when the Dalton family is unlucky one day, everyone is slowly calculating.</p>
<p>   It is never too late for Hudson to take revenge. Anyway, he is younger than Earl Pierce. As long as he pays attention to maintenance, he will definitely have a chance to bungee jump from Pierce's grave in the future.</p>
<p>   Fortunately, the number of nobles who were pulled out of the list is a bit large, whether they are the children of northern Xinjiang nobles or local nobles, they have all been taken care of. Almost all nobles with a little bit of strength enjoyed the treatment of individual criticism.</p>
<p>   It can be seen that strength is directly proportional to the ability to cause trouble. If he dared to make a fuss without any strength, he would have been taught to be a man long ago.</p>
<p>   After the reprimand was over, Hudson was surprised to find that Earl Pierce did not mention the parties involved in the incident. Obviously, this doesn't mean things are over.</p>
<p>  Whether it is intentional killing or beating someone to death by mistake, it is a life lawsuit involving nobles.</p>
<p>   If it is not brought up for discussion on the spot, then it is ready to be dealt with coldly. It's just that the final result will definitely not be simple, otherwise the northern Xinjiang nobles who have lost their teammates will not let it go.</p>
