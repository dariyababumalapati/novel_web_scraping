     Charles III's enthronement was like adding a bucket of water to a frying pan. Oil mixed with water droplets splashed out, causing the frying pan of the Aslant continent to crack.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Faced with this kind of big news, the cult rebellion had to take a back seat. The rumors became reality, and all the major forces that received the news were stunned.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It was not only the Holy See that reacted strongly. The Yinlibia Kingdom in the southern continent also felt the pressure.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Charles III has become emperor, and the Franks' ambitions have all been exposed. Now is the time for the kingdom to make a choice.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Opportunities and challenges coexist. The choices we make now will determine the future fate of the kingdom. What do you think? Tell us what you think? "
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Bordeaux VIII's solemn question made the atmosphere in the hall suddenly become serious.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although the southern continent is vast, it cannot accommodate three overlords. The Frankish Kingdom, the Libyan Kingdom, and the Church, only one of them can survive.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the past, they just watched the fight between the Frankish Kingdom and the Holy See and took sides according to their own interests.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As time went by, the balance between the two was eventually broken.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     On one side is the rising Frankish Kingdom, and on the other side is the fading Vatican. It is obvious which one is stronger and which one is weaker.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Watching the gap in power between the two sides widen, the Libyan Kingdom, which had originally been able to play both sides, inevitably leaned towards the Holy See politically.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It's just that because of the conflict between royal power and divine power, the two families, which should have worked together, did not really stand together.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Your Majesty, Charles III's claim to the throne is an absolute failure! For the sake of a false title, he put the country in danger. It is totally not worth it.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     With the strength of the Frankish Kingdom, as long as they continue to develop step by step, they will be able to completely suppress the Holy See in ten years at most.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If we wait until that time to declare ourselves emperor, the Five-Nation Alliance will be unable to reach us, and we will probably have no choice but to accept the outcome.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But it's different now. Although the Holy See is in decline, it still has strength.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although the kingdom's overall strength is slightly inferior, when it joins forces with the Holy See, its strength is still greater than that of the Frankish Kingdom.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The countries on the continent are not fools. Although they hate the Holy See, they also dislike the emperor.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If the countries were to take sides, the probability of supporting the Frankish Kingdom would be very low. Even some countries that were dependent on them might not support the Frankish Kingdom at this moment.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The only thing you need to pay attention to is: when joining forces with various forces, you must be careful and vigilant to avoid being betrayed by your allies! "
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Prime Minister Marquis Olmos said with an embarrassed look on his face.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If possible, he did not want to go to war with the Frankish Kingdom. It seemed that the first kingdom on the continent and the second kingdom on the continent were only one rank apart, but the gap in strength between the two was definitely not small.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Franks became the strongest nation on the continent through repeated wars. Many countries, including Libya, suffered at the hands of the Franks on the battlefield.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But reality is always different from what we think. Libya could tolerate the Frankish Kingdom becoming a hegemonic country, but could not watch them become an empire.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It seems to be just a family affair of the Franks, but in fact it affects the future development of the human race.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If they didn't find a way to interrupt Charles III's path to becoming king, the outside world would think they were scared. They might not even be able to attract allies in the subsequent international camps.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Prime Minister, it may be difficult to form an intervention coalition. The Five Nations Alliance has been separated from the outside. At this moment, the three countries in the Central Continent are busy suppressing the cult rebellion. There are also foreign races around, eyeing them covetously. It is unknown whether they can send a large army.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the southern continent, except for us and the Holy See, the other kingdoms have already declined.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if they are willing to join the war, they can't send many elite troops. The main force of the intervening coalition will most likely fall on us and the Holy See.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Theoretically speaking, if we combine the strength of our two families, plus the support of other countries on the continent, we can indeed crush the Franks.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But all this is based on the assumption that the enemy does not take any action and sits there waiting to be killed. If the Franks take the initiative to attack, those fence-sitters may not dare to take sides.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If the people of the Church play a trick on us and do not put in enough effort on the battlefield, then the situation may very well turn into a showdown between us and the Franks..."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Lord Midford swallowed back the most unpleasant words, but his analysis of the worst possible scenario was deeply imprinted in everyone's mind.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     From a diplomatic perspective, this situation is indeed possible. Selling out teammates is not something that has never happened in human history.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is undoubtedly in the best interests of the Vatican to work without putting in any effort and just sit back and watch Libya and Frank suffer losses.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, the prerequisite is that the Libyan Kingdom has the strength to fight the Franks to a draw. If the battle is one-sided, the Church will not dare to stand aside and watch.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "What Earl Midford said is correct. There is still a certain gap between the kingdom and the Franks. We must avoid fighting alone.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If we want to join hands with the Holy See to organize an intervention army, then we must ask the Holy See to go all out.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If possible, it would be best to reduce the presence of the kingdom and let the Holy See serve as the main force of the anti-French alliance!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Marquis of Francesco was also embarrassed by the Minister of War's cowardly words.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, now is the time to make a decision. He cannot let the kingdom's top leaders misjudge the military strength of both sides for the sake of an illusory face.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     A group of people were talking about the risks, but no one was against sending troops to intervene. It was obvious that Charles III's claim to the throne had touched the core bottom line of the Libyan Kingdom.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After much discussion, the intervention plan was approved. However, the specific implementation process must be done with great caution.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Similar scenes are playing out in many countries. Although in the eyes of several major powers, these countries are just fence-sitters who are just joining in the fun, it does not mean that they themselves think so.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In particular, several kingdoms that have already declined are all prepared to take this opportunity to show their strength to the outside world so as to avoid being looked down upon.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The international disturbances also affected the Alpha Kingdom, but compared with the previous high efficiency, the Kingdom's government's response this time was much slower.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When Hudson rushed to the capital to attend the meeting, it was already half a month after Charles III ascended the throne. The Holy See and Yin Libya had already called on human countries to form an intervention coalition internationally.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Being politically unresponsive is a statement in itself. If it weren't for the desire to be gregarious, Hudson doubted that today's meeting would have been held.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Kingdom of Alpha would certainly not recognize Charles III's claim to the throne, as this was a matter of principle. However, sending troops to intervene was another matter.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Stepping into the palace hall and feeling the atmosphere of the venue, Hudson could only use one word to describe it: "ice and fire".
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Except for King Caesar IV who was very unhappy, most of the others were indifferent to Charles III's enthronement.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, you can be indifferent in your heart, but you will definitely criticize it on the surface. Unfortunately, everyone is too focused on watching the fun, and the criticism is not performed well.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Hudson followed the crowd and cursed Charles III a few times, then sat down in his seat, leisurely drinking tea and eating snacks.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If someone takes the lead, there will naturally be no shortage of imitators. The originally serious meeting instantly turned into a tea-drinking exchange meeting.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As the boss, Caesar IV was very dissatisfied with all this. However, in the Alpha Kingdom, there was no such crime as "disrespectful behavior in front of the emperor".
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If a minor noble loses his manners, he will be considered uneducated and laughed at by the aristocratic circle. But for a great noble, it is considered as carelessness.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Back in the day, Hudson was often referred to as a bumpkin, but that changed when he became the marshal of the kingdom.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Those who had offended him in the past would come running to apologize, bringing generous gifts.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As a magnanimous nobleman, Hudson naturally would not bother with these villains. However, these guys still had a hard time.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This is the power brought by power. Even if Hudson did nothing, he would still make life difficult for those villains who had offended him.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It may seem like there is no revenge, but in fact it is more terrible than revenge. This is because people sympathize with the weak, especially the aristocratic circle with complicated relationships.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If Hudson really took action to retaliate, there would definitely be some nobles who would come out to rescue him. On the contrary, doing nothing would make these guys even more uncomfortable.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Precious family connections are used to save lives, not to be wasted. If you suffer a little injustice, people may not see it.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Seeing the growing crowd of people watching the fun, Caesar IV's mood became worse and worse. The group of ministers in front of him was really annoying, and none of them would open up to him.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "boom!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After clapping his hands fiercely, Caesar IV shouted at everyone, "Enough!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     I asked you to come here today to hold a meeting, not to listen to you cursing.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you want to curse Charles III, go to the Frankish Kingdom! No matter how harshly you curse him here, no one will hear you! "
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The king suddenly lost his temper, and the ministers were also shocked. However, no one found out that the cause was themselves, and they just thought that the king was in a bad mood.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Deep down, some people still wondered if the king and the queen had quarreled again.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Ever since the prince's accident, problems have arisen in the love life of the model couple, the king and the queen.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, this is the king's family affair, and no one would be stupid enough to get involved.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for Caesar IV's proposal, everyone tacitly pretended not to hear it. It didn't matter if they were just talking nonsense on their own territory.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you go to the Frankish Kingdom and curse Charles III, it means you are really tired of living.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Your Majesty, there is actually nothing to discuss about Charles III's enthronement.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     We must certainly condemn this act of ascending the throne despite opposition from various countries.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, there is no need to interfere with the coalition. The Franks made great efforts in the establishment of the Five Nations Alliance, and this is a good opportunity to repay this favor.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if we don't participate, the outside world will understand. We don't get along with the Dawn Church. Where they are, there is no us.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The intervention coalition was organized by the Holy See, how can the Kingdom join it! "
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As soon as the Prime Minister, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, finished his words, Caesar IV became angry again.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     From the perspective of the kingdom, there is nothing wrong with doing this. The Alpha Kingdom has no conflict of interest in the southern continent, so a few verbal condemnations are enough to show their stance.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But from the king's perspective, the situation was completely different. Originally everyone was on an equal footing, but now someone suddenly wanted to jump to the front and suppress the others. How could this be tolerated?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     What's worse is that when Charles III ascended the throne and proclaimed himself emperor, he also announced that he would continue the legal system of the last unified empire in human history, which was a challenge to all monarchs.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Wouldn't it be a disguised recognition that the Frankish Empire was the orthodox human race and that their kings were just restless princes if Charles III was allowed to be emperor?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if it is inconvenient for the kingdom to send troops, it still has to send an expeditionary force symbolically to strongly demonstrate the political stance of the Alpha Kingdom.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Prime Minister, you are old!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There is no such thing as human relations between countries. Everything should be based on the interests of the kingdom. Why should we care about the feelings of the Franks?"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As soon as Caesar IV finished speaking, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly became tense. As a monarch, saying that a minister is old, isn't this clearly sending him home?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If other people were asked to resign, everyone would understand. The Grand Duke of Newfoundland in front of him was not an ordinary prime minister of the kingdom, but also a core member of the royal family.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is easy to replace the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, but it is not an easy task to pick someone from the royal family to fill the vacancy.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Are we going to let Grand Duke Efiero take the throne?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This thought flashed through everyone's mind. The position of the prime minister was very important, and the position of the military minister was equally important.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is impossible to hold both positions!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If someone holds two positions at the same time, the king will not be able to sleep well. This practice of destroying the political balance is completely deliberate cultivation of powerful officials.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If Grand Duke Efiero fills the position, the vacant position of Minister of War will not be taken by an ordinary person.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At least at this moment, no member of the royal family has the prestige to hold such an important position.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If personnel adjustments are made without authorization when a suitable successor cannot be found, it would be equivalent to handing over the political resources of the royal family to others.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if the person promoted is the king's confidant, as long as he sits in the position, a new political group will inevitably be born.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if this person is loyal to the royal family, he still has to arrange his own people. It seems to be a simple replacement, but in fact it is a major earthquake that affects the political balance of the kingdom.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Hudson, who was mentally prepared, did not panic with everyone else and just acted as a spectator.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There is no family affection in front of power, even members of the royal family cannot stand in the way of the king.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is very regrettable that the Grand Duke of Newfoundland, who devoted his life to the kingdom, never imagined that he would so soon become a stumbling block to the king's power.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Your Majesty is right. When people get old, they are no longer useful and cannot see things comprehensively. If that is the case, then Your Majesty should choose someone more capable and virtuous!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After saying this, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland just walked away in anger.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Prime Minister!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Prime Minister!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     ...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The ministers almost instinctively tried to persuade Caesar IV to stay. This scene further strengthened Caesar IV's decision. He had been a little hesitant at first, but now he had no more reservations.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Now it is the Grand Duke of Newfoundland who left on his own initiative, which has led to such a situation. If the Grand Duke of Newfoundland pretends to be ignorant and insists on holding on to his position, he will be even more passive.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "The Grand Duke of Newfoundland has made great contributions to the kingdom. He is now old and has stepped down, but the position of Prime Minister cannot remain vacant.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Duke Efiero..."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Before he could finish his words, the Grand Duke of Efiero, who was named, interrupted him and said, "Your Majesty, I am two years older than the Grand Duke of Newfoundland!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The earth-shattering answer shocked the court.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The former prime minister was sent back home by the king, and the new prime minister's appointment had not even been announced, but he jumped out to mess things up.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It's definitely a drama of royal infighting.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If Caesar IV had known that the situation would turn out like this, he would probably not have started by taking action against the prime minister right from the start.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Unfortunately, there is no regret medicine in politics. Once Grand Duke Efiero's words came to fruition, he was doomed to not be able to continue staying in the court, otherwise he would be slapping Caesar IV in the face.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The resignation of the two elders of the royal camp immediately broke the political balance of the court. Even though Caesar IV had made preparations in advance, he did not expect the situation to deteriorate to this point.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Without much lingering, the heartbroken Grand Duke Efiero simply waved his sleeves and strode out of the court.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There were already few people in the hall, and the two most important seats were suddenly vacant, and the atmosphere suddenly became subtle.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Everyone was waiting for Caesar IV to announce new personnel appointments, but after the lesson just now, he became hesitant.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The transfer of power also requires a transition. With the loss of two elders at once, the royal camp directly lost its leader in the court.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This is the most hardcore royalist!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The first blow he took after taking power was against his own people. Hudson didn't know how to complain.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But if you think about it carefully, there is nothing wrong with what Caesar IV did. Before this, he had discussed personnel adjustments with the prime minister, but the prime minister rejected them all.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The reasons given were extremely embarrassing: either they said that the successor had limited ability and was not as capable as the current incumbent in the court; or they angrily criticized the successor pushed forward by Caesar IV as a flatterer.

    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After many fruitless discussions, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland became the biggest stumbling block on Caesar IV's path to power. Without taking down the chancellor, it would be difficult to place his own people in the court.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After making concessions again and again, Caesar IV, who had accumulated a lot of resentment, finally exploded.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As a king, it was natural for him to hold power. But in his case, he almost became a high-level rubber stamp.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although the ministers in the court respected him as a king and no one did anything to betray the emperor, when it came to state affairs, few of these "loyal ministers" gave him face.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     He endured this for more than five years, but no one could understand his grievances.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     He could not hold it back any longer and exploded, only to suddenly realize that he had thought too simply. Without the cooperation of the royal camp in the court, his plan was full of loopholes.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Whether Caesar IV was willing or not, the vacant positions of prime minister and minister of war had to be filled by people in the court.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It would be impossible for someone to randomly appoint a confidant to such an important position in the Alpha Kingdom.
