<p>  The best positions in the two counties were taken by the nobles of northern Xinjiang. Although the Governor's Mansion made a wave of enclaves flying all over the sky to make trouble, it still failed to change this fact.</p>
<p>  Among the local nobles, the geographical location is slightly better, and they are still a few small nobles who inherited their ancestors. Whether the family business can be preserved is still unknown.</p>
<p>   Don’t say that it was Hudson who supported them. Even if the local nobles in the two counties supported them together, they would not be able to compete with Baron Sith.</p>
<p>   After all, the world of nobles still depends on themselves after all, and the support of outsiders is only support, and cannot fundamentally change the gap in strength between the two sides.</p>
<p>  Especially the Baron Sith and the father of a grand duke. Although I don’t know how much support there is, the 800 elite soldiers who followed southward are enough to dispel many people’s minds.</p>
<p>  Even Hudson, after falling out with Baron Sith, did not rush to take action, because he was worried that the Grand Duke who was thousands of miles away would intervene.</p>
<p>   There is no way, the status and strength gap between the two parties is too great, and they are not on the same level at all.</p>
<p>   It’s okay to push the flames secretly, and directly confront the conflict. What if the old guy doesn’t abide by the rules and directly sends someone over to kill him?</p>
<p>   Counting on the Dalton family to succeed?</p>
<p>  If you accepted Earl Pierce's solicitation before, you can still look forward to it. Now, His Excellency the Governor did not retaliate against him, that is generous enough.</p>
<p>   Looking back on the smooth sailing of the previous development, Hudson gradually realized that something was wrong. It is the instinct of the big nobles to suppress the rise of the small and medium nobles within their own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>  The Mountain Territory is developing so rapidly, and everyone can see the rising trend. The Dalton family did not respond at all, which is obviously unreasonable.</p>
<p>   Thinking of the Sith Baron who was in the limelight, Hudson instantly understood. The smooth development of the relationship before, still delayed the great fortune of this uncle.</p>
<p>  Although the Governor's Mansion has used many small tricks, it is far from enough to squeeze out the noble children of the Northland.</p>
<p>  If the Dalton family could take action against them, then Earl Pierce would not have intervened in the dispute between the two counties so early. You only need to watch the situation escalate, and after ten or eight nobles die, come out to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>  As for the tense situation in the mainland before, can those old guys still see that both sides are bluffing?</p>
<p>  If there is a turmoil, with the strength of the Dalton family, the unstable factors can be eliminated before the chaos breaks out.</p>
<p>   Instead of continuing to fuel the flames, they took the opportunity to beat the Northland nobles to death. It is estimated that the families behind the Northland nobles exerted pressure, or made deals with the Dalton family in other ways.</p>
<p>   It’s not convenient to go out in person, and you don’t want all the children of the northern nobles to take root in your back garden, so you need to put the chess pieces on it.</p>
<p>  There is no doubt that all the children of the local nobles in the two counties are pawns of the Dalton family, and Hudson is no exception.</p>
<p>   When he was in Dardir City last time, Earl Pierce did not shy away from provoking the relationship between Hudson and Baron Sith.</p>
<p>  Thinking of this step, Hudson secretly complained. Sure enough, the more you know, the more troubles you will encounter.</p>
<p>  If he doesn't know anything, he can fight Baron Sith, mobilize all his connections and slowly get him down.</p>
<p>   Are the eight hundred elites amazing?</p>
<p>  As long as a few more neighborhood disputes are provoked, it will soon become seven hundred, six hundred, five hundred...Continuously winning battles, but the strength in hand is constantly weakening, until one day the advantages are exhausted.</p>
<p>   Unless his grand duke father is willing to invest continuously, Hudson has a way to slowly bleed Baron Sith.</p>
<p>  But now that he knows Earl Pierce's calculations, Hudson can no longer play like that. It is necessary to fight with Baron Sith, and it is necessary for this man to make a movement to attract the attention of the Dalton family and strive for a relaxed development environment for himself.</p>
<p>   It is best to let the Dalton family think that the two sides are fighting evenly, and it is difficult to tell the winner for a while, or that they are at a slight disadvantage.</p>
<p>   As long as there is a stalemate, the Dalton family will think that everything is under control and will not rush to suppress the development of the mountain territory.</p>
<p>   "Tell the messenger that I will bring people to attend on time."</p>
<p>   Hudson said indifferently.</p>
<p>  I want to attend the party, but not to cheer, but to spoil the situation in the past.</p>
<p>   Maybe it seems a bit petty, and the means are not clever enough, but as a small nobleman who needs to live, the means don't need to be too clever.</p>
<p>  Sometimes the means are too clever, which is also a sin.</p>
<p>  In the world of nobles, if the family strength is weak and the personal ability is too strong, it will often suffer a big loss.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Maple Leaf Collar, with a large number of orc slaves going south, Baron Kettley really picked up a lot of bargains.</p>
<p>   "Monopolizing the orc slave trade" and becoming "the largest orc slave trader in the southeastern provinces"... Baron Kettley has achieved all these ambitious goals.</p>
<p>   Then, things got awkward. It's okay for him to lead soldiers to fight, but it's embarrassing for him to do business. The group of warriors under him are obviously not suitable for business.</p>
<p>  Although he also participated in the smuggling trade when he was in the Northland, that kind of business was dominated by the family, and he was only the executor in the middle.</p>
<p>  The goods between the Alpha Kingdom and the Orc Empire are all rare and in short supply in the local area, and they have been booked early, so there is no need to find a market at all.</p>
<p>   Originally thought that as long as they monopolized the supply of orc slaves, customers would come to them by themselves. Facts have proved that he is completely overthinking.</p>
<p>  Northern nobles and local nobles are completely in two circles. The news that Baron Kettley has a large number of orc slaves is only passed on in their inner circle. The outside world does not even know that he has become the largest slave trader in the southeastern province.</p>
<p>   If the news is delivered slowly, it is not unacceptable. As long as a few days pass, other nobles will still receive the news.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is that he sent someone to notify some nobles nearby, clearly telling them that he had a large number of orc slaves in his hands, but they replied to him with three words—"Got it!"</p>
<p>   "This gang of **** southern border nobles, for the sake of their pitiful face, they don't even care about their own interests!</p>
<p>  Knowing that the labor force in their territory is insufficient, they don't know how to buy some slaves to supplement. Just wait, there will be times when they will regret it..."</p>
<p>   Silently greeted all the local noble families, Baron Kettley found helplessly that the problem still needs to be solved.</p>
<p>  Slaves are not other commodities, they can be sold for a long time, and these guys have to eat. With tens of thousands more mouths, just eating and drinking every day is a lot of money.</p>
<p>   What's more, in order to monopolize the slave trade, Baron Kettley has put down all his net worth, and relied on the guarantee provided by the family to owe a large amount of foreign debts.</p>
<p>  Now there are only funds left to maintain the operation of the territory. If these slaves cannot be sold in time, the territory will be declared bankrupt next month.</p>
<p>   "How about it, Uncle Holman? Has anyone ever made an offer?"</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley asked expectantly.</p>
<p>  In order to find a guy to take the lead in purchasing, he had to send the most trusted Holman knight around him. After all, the threshold for aristocratic gentlemen is very high. It is not the nobles who visit in the past, and it is estimated that they will not even see them in person.</p>
<p>  "Kately, prepare for the worst!</p>
<p>  Originally everyone was excited when they heard that there were cheap slaves for sale, but when they learned that we were selling orc slaves, all of them changed their faces.</p>
<p>  Even the orc slaves we gave away were returned by them. The reason is: it is possible to frighten the residents of the territory, and they need to be responsible to all the people of the territory.</p>
<p>   Of course, it's not completely deserted. Several nobles are interested in fox girl, cat girl, rabbit girl, leopard girl... If the price is cheap, they said they can take over.</p>
<p>   There is also a nobleman who said that his family has a relationship in the Colosseum. If we have orcs from the five royal families for sale, he can help to contact them. "</p>
<p>  After hearing Knight Holman's explanation, Baron Kettley almost vomited blood. No one wants free slaves, how annoying this orc is.</p>
<p>  Only for fox girls, cat girls, rabbit girls, leopard girls... Is he the kind of extravagant and lustful nobleman who has no conscience?</p>
<p>  Although there were indeed some beauties of different races among the acquired slaves, they were used to build relationships and expand contacts, not to sell them individually.</p>
<p>  If it is sold separately, no matter how high the price is, a beauty from a foreign race will only cost a hundred and eighty gold coins at most.</p>
<p>   Unless the beauty of the alien race is a nobleman among the orcs, or a member of the five royal families, it is possible to sell at a higher price.</p>
<p>   But the question is, are orc nobles so easy to catch? Even if the slave hunting team's interests are swayed, they must first guarantee their lives before returning.</p>
<p>   Contacting the Colosseum is even more nonsense, arresting the orcs of the five royal families as slaves, I really think that the bureaucrats of the orc empire are all dead!</p>
<p>  In normal times, when everyone is engaged in smuggling or arresting a few slaves, there is no big commotion. That is because the protection fee has been paid in advance.</p>
<p>  As long as you keep your eyes open and don't provoke the big shots of the orc empire, if you happen to meet the orc army, there is a 70% to 80% chance of getting out.</p>
<p>  If someone in the slave hunting team acts recklessly, offends people who shouldn't be provoked, or does something that shouldn't be done, which will trigger a backlash from the orcs, and the slave hunting team that went deep into the orc empire at the same time will suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>  This is not the most serious, and even more serious can even set off a military conflict on the border.</p>
<p>   "Why, that Baron Hudson is not interested either? His mines require a lot of labor. These stupid orc slaves are the best consumables."</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley asked struggling.</p>
<p>  The worst plan is to select beautiful women from all the slaves and sell them to the nobles, and then sell the races with stronger force value to the Colosseum.</p>
<p>  Select slaves who are easy to manage and good at farming from the remaining slaves, and keep them for their own territory.</p>
<p>  The remaining **** slaves can only beg for help. Please ask the nobles who have made friends to help digest some for the sake of past friendship.</p>
<p>   If you really can’t deal with it, then sell it with tears in your eyes. If it is dealt with at a low price to an unscrupulous mine owner, every penny of the return is worth one penny.</p>
<p>  The price of slaves purchased by Baron Kettley in bulk is very low. Theoretically speaking, as long as the operation is done properly, there is a high probability that the cost can still be recovered.</p>
<p>  If you succeed, you will earn blood, if you fail, you will keep your capital. Even if there is a loss, it will not be too serious. Such a transaction is naturally worth betting everything.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that the plan is beautiful, but the reality is indeed skinny. For a monopoly business to make money, there must be a prerequisite - rigid demand.</p>
<p>   Orc slaves are obviously not just-needed products. Even if some aristocrats are interested in beauties from other races, but that is optional consumption, and no one is interested in paying high prices to take over.</p>
<p>  The Colosseum, there are only three or five in the entire southeastern province. Even if they are willing to open up the acquisition, it is estimated that they will eat a few hundred people at most.</p>
<p>   This has to be related before it can be sold. After all, they have fixed partners, and they will not change easily.</p>
<p>  The most valuable slaves cannot be sold at a high price, and it is impossible to earn money through monopoly blood. Even the difficulty of repayment has increased several times in an instant. On the contrary, the probability of losing money began to rise sharply.</p>
<p>   "I haven't seen Baron Hudson himself. However, according to his butler, their orders have dropped sharply recently, and they will slowly reduce production after the spring begins.</p>
<p>   Messages should be reliable. Mountain collar has received a lot of big orders this year, and the total number of products sold in just half a year exceeds 50,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>   Now that the situation is stabilizing, the junk weapons they produce are worthless except cheap, and they will definitely not be sold in the future.</p>
<p>  Just selling farm tools and daily necessities, next year's orders will definitely not compare with this year's. If the Baron of Hudson continues to insist on not selling iron, the reduction of mine production is inevitable. "</p>
<p>   Knight Holman replied helplessly.</p>
<p>   It's not that he, a salesman, doesn't work hard, it's precisely because he works so hard that he even inquired about the production situation of the mountain collar.</p>
<p>   There is nothing wrong with knowing yourself and your enemy. It's a pity that he only contacted a housekeeper who was borrowed from abroad, not the real decision-maker in the mountainous territory, and the news he inquired about was naturally only on the surface.</p>
<p>  The wrong news directly led Holman Knight to make a misjudgment, thinking that Master Hudson, who had reduced production in the mine, had a sharp drop in demand for labor.</p>
<p>  Although the mountainous territory is constantly opening up wasteland, the outside world still does not think that this situation can continue forever.</p>
<p>  Most people believe that Hudson spent all his money on land reclamation just to achieve food self-sufficiency in the territory and reduce the financial expenditure of the territory.</p>
<p>  Based on the current population of the mountain territory, the land reclamation operation should be over after a year or two. To continue to invest, even if Hudson is willing, his wallet must be able to bear it.</p>
<p>   Serfs who work and serfs who don't work, the consumption is not at the same level. Especially for heavy physical work like land reclamation, the body can't sustain it without the supply of nutrition.</p>
<p>  The output of the newly opened land is low. In the past few years, it was mainly land cultivation, and the land income must not be expected in the short term.</p>
<p>  Now Hudson can toss his life, that is because he has made a lot of money selling weapons this year. But this kind of profiteering business is rare, and the mine's income cannot continue to be so high.</p>
<p>   After pondering for a long time, Baron Kettley, who had experienced a fierce ideological struggle, said slowly: "Foreign beauties should not be sold for the time being, these are cash cows, and it is not worthwhile to sell them all at once.</p>
<p>   Arrange for a businessman to open a brothel in his name. The location is placed in the territory, attracting those nobles to come to seek pleasure.</p>
<p>   Originally, I wanted to arrange restaurants, casinos, and arenas. Now that the territory is not financially rich, I can only postpone it first.</p>
<p>  The remaining slaves can be sold as much as they can sell now, and the funds should be withdrawn first as much as possible.</p>
<p>  I want to visit Baron Hudson personally. Although orc slaves are not very useful, they can also be used as coolies.</p>
<p>  The mountains are not all plains. So much land has been reclaimed, so we can’t rely on the sky for food, right?</p>
<p>   It is estimated that our neighbors have already started planning water conservancy projects, which is a bigger project than land reclamation. There are not enough lives to fill it in, I am afraid it will not be completed.</p>
<p>  The work hasn't started yet, so I guess he's not ready to take his life to fill it. Although serfs were worthless, excessive wear and tear would damage the reputation of nobles.</p>
<p>  From what I understand, that profiteer is a fame-seeking master, and he will never let himself bear the notoriety of cruelty and tyranny.</p>
<p>  Under normal circumstances, he will probably construct part of the project every year to extend the construction period and reduce casualties.</p>
<p>  But now there are slaves that are cheap and can be tossed at will, and this guy will not refuse.</p>
<p>  If it goes well, we still have a chance to keep the principal this time. Even if it is a real loss, it will not lose too much.</p>
<p>  Although our neighbor is a profiteer, we have to admit that he still has a bottom line in his work. I have done so many businesses, and I have never pushed people to a dead end.</p>
<p>  Before the autumn plowing, he sold a lot of farm tools on credit. Although the price is a bit high, it still solves the urgent needs of many people.</p>
<p>   It is estimated that except for me, the unlucky guy who was tricked more miserably, most of the people who have traded with him are still thinking about him secretly. "</p>
<p>   It can be seen that Baron Kettley is very unwilling. But there is no way, the nobles in the southeastern province really have no love for orc slaves.</p>
<p>  What is the specific reason? There is a high probability that he was not forced to a corner. As local snakes, it is far easier to obtain serfs than outsiders like them.</p>
<p>   There are better human serfs available, why buy uncertain orc slaves?</p>
<p>   Among other things, the language barrier is a big problem. Unless Baron Kettley sells slaves, he also equips them with translators.</p>
<p>   This is obviously impossible. There are many races of orcs. Apart from the group of weird shamans, who would dare to speak the language of all the races of orcs?</p>
<p>  It cannot solve the pain points of users, so Baron Kettley was doomed to fail from the very beginning of this business.</p>
<p>   What makes him most unacceptable is the hard tossing, which is obviously in the process of capitalizing on the enemy. In the end, he still has to expect the competitor to be virtuous in order to keep the principal.</p>
<p>   After finishing speaking, the swift and swift Baron Kettley straddled out directly. He couldn't continue to procrastinate. Every extra day of delay would consume tens of thousands of pounds of food. He really couldn't stand it.</p>
