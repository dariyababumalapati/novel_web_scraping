All kinds of farm implements are neatly arranged and piled up to fill the whole room.</p>
<p>   "Your Excellency, please rest assured to choose, here is only a small part of them. If you are not satisfied, there are other styles of farm tools in the back."</p>
<p>   Hudson said pretending to be indifferent.</p>
<p>  In fact, there are not so many real types of farm tools that seem to be various. There are so many different styles, mainly from different craftsmen.</p>
<p>  In order to provide customers with diversified services, Hudson did not engage in standardized production. After all, they are all handmade, and it is troublesome to unify the standard.</p>
<p>   Due to the need for differentiated pricing, the same product is produced by different craftsmen, and there are slight differences in price.</p>
<p>  Of course, the price gap has not widened too much. It is not that Hudson’s marketing methods are not good. The main thing is that these products are ordinary farm tools and do not have the ability to pay a high premium.</p>
<p>   An embarrassing scene appeared. Looking at the various farm tools in front of him, Baron Kettley didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>  Let him choose a weapon, it will definitely be able to speak clearly and logically, and he can conduct a professional evaluation of all weapons. However, choosing farm tools is obviously an over-the-top exam question, and it has never been within the scope of his knowledge reserve.</p>
<p>   Originally thought that there were only a few kinds of farm tools, and he could just buy them directly, and Baron Kettley didn't work hard, but now he is entangled.</p>
<p>  Go back and bring the old farmer over to pick?</p>
<p>   No way, wouldn’t that be the great Baron Kettley, even worse than a lowly serf!</p>
<p>  Looking at the prices marked on each piece of farm equipment, Baron Kettley breathed a sigh of relief. Although I don't know how much the price has been driven up, it is indeed not high in terms of unit price.</p>
<p>  Taking the plow as an example, the cheapest one only costs 3.5 silver coins, and the most expensive one only costs 8 silver coins. The main factor that determines the price of a plow is not the craft shape, but its weight.</p>
<p>  Of course, all the small farm tools are stored here. The big ones pulled by eight cows cannot be bought with a few silver coins.</p>
<p>   He didn't sell large farm tools to Baron Kettley because he didn't have enough livestock in his territory, and they were all driven by manpower, so large farm tools couldn't be used at all.</p>
<p>He casually picked up a farm tool and weighed it. Baron Kettley frowned and said: "Baron Hudson, the toughness of these farm tools is too poor, and the sharpness is not enough. You can't use high-quality iron to carry out Build it?"</p>
<p>  Hearing the most amateurish criticism, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. I'm afraid I want to go to heaven if I cast farm tools with high-quality iron.</p>
<p>   "If you can afford three times the price, I don't mind using high-quality iron for casting. It's just that it's too extravagant. Farm tools are just farm tools after all, and the performance requirements are far less than weapons.</p>
<p>  The performance of these agricultural tools is completely sufficient for daily farming. If the quality is improved, it is not a farm tool, but a weapon. "</p>
<p>  The customer is the owner of the dawn. In theory, Hudson will not refuse any reasonable request from the customer, provided that the money must be paid.</p>
<p>  As long as you are willing to pay more, Hudson can also let his men cast agricultural tools of the same level as weapons.</p>
<p>   As for wanting to use the price gap to buy farm tools and go back to smelting and casting weapons, that is simply a dream.</p>
<p>   It’s not Hudson’s boasting. Once these agricultural tools are smelted and cast into weapons, whichever quality must be more touching, it will be as touching.</p>
<p>   Unless money is added, the quality gap between farm tools and weapons cannot be changed. In this regard, Master Hudson is very principled.</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley didn't know how to choose, so he simply picked what he had seen before. Although the agricultural tools purchased may not be the most cost-effective, at least they can be guaranteed to be usable and will not be pitted too badly</p>
<p>  From the beginning to the end, Hudson didn't talk too much, and he was completely allowed to choose. The only restriction was that he could not bargain.</p>
<p>  Of course, this is just a small problem. As a high-ranking nobleman, few like to care about it. Especially for products with low unit prices, there is no accurate pricing template in mind.</p>
<p>   In less than half an hour, Baron Kettley completed the selection of products, and the efficiency is so high that it can definitely be called swift and resolute.</p>
<p>   Customers are so refreshing, Hudson is also very satisfied. This is much easier than doing business in the previous life. Not only does it have low requirements on the quality of the products, but even the after-sales service can be ignored.</p>
<p>   Such a high-quality customer made Hudson feel embarrassed to cheat too hard. After all, this kind of business pays attention to the long flow of water, and the leek roots cannot be dug up at one time.</p>
<p>   "There are four hundred and one gold coins, three silver coins and forty copper coins in total, and the change at the back has been wiped off, so it can be counted as four hundred and one gold coins.</p>
<p>   There is still a quota of ninety-nine gold coins before the minimum consumption. Why don't you choose some daily necessities, such as kitchen knives, iron pans, shovels...</p>
<p>  Everything that can be used in daily life is here. Applying these products to the kitchen will greatly improve the living standards of soldiers. "</p>
<p>   Hudson pushed hard.</p>
<p>   Didn't mention serfs, because he knew that in the eyes of the nobles, it was a gift for the lowly serfs to survive, and improving their living standards was not considered at all.</p>
<p>  Everyone doesn't care about the serfs, but they pay special attention to the elite soldiers under them.</p>
<p>   They are all meritorious ministers. If conditions permit, it is natural to give the soldiers a better life, otherwise who would be willing to sacrifice their lives?</p>
<p>   "Then trouble Baron Hudson!"</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley said calmly.</p>
<p>   Seeing that the two carriages he had brought were full, and there were still a pile of agricultural tools waiting to be loaded on the ground, and only costing four hundred and one gold coins, Master Kettley instantly calmed down.</p>
<p>   Having bought all the most needed agricultural tools, the rest is no longer a problem. Anyway, he made up his mind to only consume the minimum.</p>
<p>   Seeing that there was no more wool to be plucked, Hudson didn't bother to continue wasting his words, and directly took Baron Kettley into the kitchen warehouse to choose.</p>
<p>   It is said to be a selection, but in fact it is just a show. After hastily collecting the minimum spending amount, Baron Kettley said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>  Looking at that posture, it seems that if you stay in the mountainous area for a while, you will encounter bad luck.</p>
<p>   But thinking about what happened to him, Hudson also expressed his understanding. He bleeds profusely every time he comes here, and the Mountain Territory is indeed an ominous place for Baron Kettley.</p>
<p>   After sending away Baron Kettler, Hudson found that there was a problem with his business model. The clients for development are all nearby neighbors, and there are none of the big clients outside.</p>
<p>   Occasionally, a few businessmen come to the door, and they sell more products than purchases. It's not that businessmen can't see business opportunities, it's because Hudson's products are too special.</p>
<p>   Weapons and equipment are the best sellers, but unfortunately, they don't have any strength, so they can't do this business at all.</p>
<p>   Farm tools and daily necessities like pots and pans are not very risky, but the nobles and lords are used to buying iron and casting it by themselves.</p>
<p>   Compared with finished products, self-processing is obviously more cost-effective. Unless Hudson can significantly reduce the price, making it cheaper to purchase finished products than to cast them themselves.</p>
<p>   Obviously, this is impossible. Even if Hudson wants to play cheap dumping, he must first complete industrial production.</p>
<p>   As far as the production capacity in the territory is concerned, there is no possibility of dumping at all. His only advantage is that he has the largest iron mine in the southeastern province, which can affect the iron price in the market.</p>
<p>  The current rise in the price of iron commodities in the market is not only due to the local nobles driving up prices, but also a large part of the reason is that he stopped selling iron to foreign countries.</p>
<p>   An embarrassing scene appeared.</p>
<p>  The profit from selling weapons in a short period of time mainly depends on the needs of the local nobles to expand their armaments.</p>
<p>   But want to promote agricultural tools and other daily necessities, the main customers are northern nobles. As outsiders, they don't have enough blacksmiths in their hands, so they can only purchase in large quantities from the outside world.</p>
<p>   Both sides are customers, and no one can offend. Isn't this forcing yourself to be a fool?</p>
<p>   Anyway, business is always done. Only with sufficient financial resources can Hudson be able to develop his own territory.</p>
<p>  Although in the eyes of the local nobles in the southeastern province, the small soil pockets in the Salam Mountains are rotten land, but in Hudson's view, they still have high development value.</p>
<p>  The food output can reach 70% of the outside world, and after feeding the serfs, there is still a certain balance. It's just that compared with the huge investment in land reclamation, the payback period is so much longer by so many billions.</p>
<p>  If you change your mind and develop animal husbandry, there are basically no restrictions.</p>
<p>  The only problem is that everyone is playing with a self-sufficient economic model. There is no fixed sales market at all, and the cattle and sheep raised can only be eaten by themselves.</p>
<p>  Maybe there is consumer demand in big cities, but that is the basic market of local nobles, and it is not the turn of outsiders to intervene.</p>
<p>  A self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy is not suitable for the development of industry and commerce, and a self-sufficient aristocratic economy severely inhibits industry and commerce.</p>
<p>   As a last resort, Hudson could only change the development plan of the territory repeatedly according to the actual situation. Until now, there is no complete development outline.</p>
<p>  There are only two main lines of development that can be determined: find ways to make money; find ways to increase the population.</p>
<p>   Only when money and people are available can the territory be fully developed. Only when the economic foundation is improved can we have the strength to promote the development of military power.</p>
<p>   It can be said that Hudson's plan is completely incompatible with the path of the nobles in this world.</p>
<p>  Almost all the great nobles rose from the battlefield. Relying on the looted loot from the east and west, he realized the leapfrog development of his own strength.</p>
<p>  The rise of every great noble family is accompanied by the birth of a "son of luck". There must be enough luck to complete the original accumulation all the way.</p>
<p>   Rubbing his forehead, Hudson, who didn't think he had bad luck, resolutely gave up following in the footsteps of his predecessors.</p>
<p>   Times have changed. The resource monopoly of the big nobles has already taken shape. Unless there is an external force to break this pattern, there will be no room for newcomers to grow.</p>
<p>   No matter how hard it is to fight, the hole has already been filled, and there is no room for it.</p>
<p>   Either pull one off the horse and replace it; or be pushed down by others, and there will be no place to die.</p>
<p>   Squeezing his thoughts, Hudson put aside the messy thoughts in his head, and directly arranged for manpower to load the car.</p>
<p>   The nobles of the two counties gathered for a feast in Dadir City, and they must go to catch the heat. Doing a good job in this business is definitely higher than the income accumulated for three years of farming at home.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  The carriage slowly drove out of Beida City, and the wrinkles on Earl Pierce's forehead increased again. The situation on the mainland became more and more complicated, so he had to change his plan.</p>
<p>   Originally wanted to take the opportunity to teach the nobles who went south and north a harsh lesson, cut off their backbones, and then slowly squeezed them out.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that the situation on the mainland has changed suddenly, and the kingdom and the Holy See are on the fence. Now the country must maintain stability.</p>
<p>  Under this background, excessively targeting the northern Xinjiang nobles who went south, this kind of thing that destroys unity is obviously not in line with the general environment of maintaining stability in the kingdom.</p>
<p>   "It seems that we can only calm things down! I just don't know what those old foxes in northern Xinjiang are thinking. Do you really think that these few pawns can make waves?"</p>
<p>   Governor Pierce said to himself.</p>
<p>  From the beginning to the end, he did not take the troubled northern Xinjiang children seriously. For the real power faction in the kingdom like Earl Pierce, only the same powerful forces can be qualified to compete with them.</p>
<p>  Information transmission in the magical world can be said to be fast or slow, but what really affects the speed of information transmission is the thoughts of the big shots.</p>
<p>  If you can make it in time, the news from the capital can reach the southeastern province on the same day. But if the big shots are not in a hurry and let the courier run around on the road, it is no problem to delay it for ten days and a half months.</p>
<p>   Of course, this is just message passing, not decision time.</p>
<p>  Many times, message delivery is slow, not because the message is really slow, but because big people need slow message delivery to cover their inefficient decision-making.</p>
<p>  This time is no exception. Earl Pierce has long received the news that the king's messenger was intercepted by the Holy See, which caused tension between the kingdom and the Holy See.</p>
<p>  But because they didn't think about how to deal with this change, the news is already on the way, and the nobles in the southeastern province haven't even received the slightest news.</p>
<p>  When did he make a decision, and when will the news officially arrive in the Southeast Province.</p>
<p>  If it takes too long, the gossip may arrive first. After all, other nobles are not vegetarians either.</p>
<p>  Although there is no channel for the rapid transmission of information, the noble children who are away from home will also take the initiative to inquire about the news.</p>
<p>   Ordinary news is nothing more than that. For news that has a greater impact, everyone will still find a way to pass it back.</p>
<p>   It's just because the news comes from "inquiry", how high the accuracy rate is, it can only depend on luck.</p>
<p>   Those who have the ability to deliver news are mostly nobles with some family background. Even if the little nobles at the bottom know the news, it is difficult to send it back in time.</p>
<p>  "Da da da…"</p>
<p>  The sound of the carriage going forward continued to ring non-stop, and Dadir City, a hundred miles away, had become very lively.</p>
<p>   The nobles are also strictly hierarchical. Although a time has been agreed, everyone still consciously arrives ahead of time.</p>
<p>   Even a group of northern Xinjiang nobles who didn't deal with the Governor's Mansion very much didn't put on airs at this time, and honestly came to wait first.</p>
<p>   Bustling is not the same as prosperity. Despite Baron Sith's hard work, Dadir City is still a city of ruins.</p>
<p>  If you want to fix it, it will be difficult to see results without a year or two of effort.</p>
<p>  As the host, Baron Sith’s recent days are one—“bitter”.</p>
<p>  The influx of a large group of nobles is equivalent to a lot of trouble coming to your door.</p>
<p>   Originally, there was a shortage of food in the territory, and he had to receive such a group of uncles, which made his poor pocket even worse.</p>
<p>   The Sith were a little suspicious. Governor Pierce placed the mediation location in Dadir City, which was deliberately aimed at him.</p>
<p>   In front of Lizi, face is no longer enough. In order to save money, Baron Sith even canceled the welcome banquet.</p>
<p>  Daily reception is also limited to provision of temporary shelter, water, firewood and some simple daily necessities, no specific food at all.</p>
<p>   It's not a matter of being stingy or not, but that the lord's family really has no food left. At the very least, he really doesn't have that much food that matches his aristocratic status.</p>
<p>   It’s okay to lose face, anyway, apart from being uncomfortable at the beginning, this thing will pass slowly.</p>
<p>   What makes Sith a headache is that there are not many nobles who are safe, and they are either doing something, or they are on the way to do it.</p>
<p>   Fighting and fighting, that is just the most basic operation. If you are not careful, it will be a street fight.</p>
<p>  Different from the clear camps before, he only needs to consider the interests of the nobles in northern Xinjiang. Now as the host, he was born with the duty of maintaining order.</p>
<p>  Casualties of ordinary soldiers don't matter, if a certain noble bumps into each other, or simply dies, he will be held responsible.</p>
<p>  In order to maintain order, he not only sent his men out, but even patrolled the streets himself.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, this is of no use. The northern nobles gave him some face as the nominal boss, but the local nobles simply ignored him.</p>
<p>   Picking things, always only need one side is enough. As long as someone makes trouble, the other party can only participate passively.</p>
<p>   Occasionally, he made a real fire, even those who persuaded the fight were beaten together. In order to persuade the fight, Baron Sith's subordinates often go out in high spirits and come back with a bruised nose and a swollen face.</p>
<p>   There were even a few unlucky guys who were killed by mistake during the process of persuading the fight, and died directly.</p>
<p>   In the end, there was nothing to say, just endless wrangling. Those who dare to have such a good time are nobles, and ordinary soldiers have the concept of killing for life in their minds, and they know that they can't kill them on such occasions.</p>
<p>   There is no other way, Baron Sith can only accept this kind of bad luck. The perpetrator is only responsible for losing money, and if he wants the other party to pay for his life, he can only appeal to the noble council.</p>
<p>   You don't need to think about it, you know, it's time to stop here. The essence of the aristocratic council is to safeguard the interests of the aristocrats, and it is self-evident who the outcome will be.</p>
<p>   I was really angry, so I could only find a chance to beat the other party afterwards.</p>
<p>  Now Baron Sith has only one thought, hoping that Earl Pierce can arrive soon, otherwise he really can't stand it.</p>
<p>   In the chaotic scene, not only Sith, the host, was hurt, but Hudson, the "businessman", was also very angry.</p>
<p>  Originally, he was just a happy melon-eating crowd, quietly watching the performances of all parties. With the enlarged three-meter body of the Earth Bear, it was enough to calm down the hot-headed guys instantly.</p>
<p>   After all, when the nobles fight and fight, everyone knows how to restrain themselves and know the severity of the attack. Warcraft is hard to say.</p>
<p>  With the current physique of the Earth Bear, he is not a professional researcher of Warcraft, so he can't tell which stage he has grown to.</p>
<p>  If he was slapped to death, he would be wronged.</p>
<p>   People fake Xiong Wei, Hudson walked to the street, it was smooth sailing.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, accidents always come so suddenly, before the excitement is over, I become the focus first.</p>
<p>  Set up a stall on the street, unfortunately involved in the conflict between two gangs.</p>
<p>  If it's just the stall being smashed, that's nothing. The key is that the guy who hit the real fire picked up a sledgehammer and opened the opponent's head.</p>
