     Chapter 205: True and False Inheritance Holy Land

   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As soon as the bank's affairs were dealt with, Hudson's attention was drawn to the orcs. The location of the inheritance holy land could not be determined, but the location of the orc tribe was easy to find.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     A group of masters of the kingdom have secretly entered the Snow Moon Territory, waiting for a perfect opportunity to make a move.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you fall behind, you will be beaten. The Orc Empire, which lacks the support of Sanctuary masters, is already at a strategic disadvantage.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Relying on the orcs' background, it would be no problem to set up traps in advance and kill one or two powerful Sanctuary warriors, but facing four, five, six, seven or eight powerful Sanctuary warriors, there would be absolutely no point.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It so happened that the Alpha Kingdom now had eight powerful saints. Their own people were definitely not enough, so they would just need to add those from their allies.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The four allies each sent a powerful Sanctuary to help. Together with the two Sanctuaries from the kingdom and Hudson's dragon-bear combination, there were a total of eight Sanctuaries.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If the orcs' holy land of heritage were exposed, it would immediately be struck by thunder from eight top warriors.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If Hudson had not been afraid that his actions would attract interference from the Sanctuary of the alien alliance, he would have already taken a group of Sanctuary warriors to the Orc Empire to cause damage.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There are knights and mages. This combination is not just "1+...+1=8". When they cooperate with each other, they can often burst out more powerful combat power.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if you encounter several main orc legions head-on, you can still break out of the siege directly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If they abandon their moral principles and do not engage in direct combat but instead launch a sneak attack, the scene will be even more tragic.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the past, Hudson didn't dare to go out and show off, because other people's traps might not be able to kill dragons and bears, but his master was not strong enough to withstand a beating!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If Maxim and Bear Stearns each have a combat power of 100, with him as their master, it would be considered good to have 120.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you hold your teammates back, you must be aware of the situation. You must not do anything that will lead to your own death.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This time the situation was different, and they had enough strength to face the danger. The only problem was that they had to be fast, and they had to finish it before the alien alliance intervened.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Who made it so that the orcs not only had no powerful people in the holy realm, but even their inherited artifacts fell into the hands of humans?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the capital, Hudson had seen the orcs' inherited artifacts: "Shaman Horn", "Sacrificial Song"...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, these artifacts are incomplete. The Alpha Kingdom only obtained a part of them, and the rest are in the hands of other major human forces.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This was not just for the orcs, all other races were treated the same. As long as the racial artifacts fell into the hands of the human race, they would be dismantled and destroyed, and then kept by the major forces.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Some parts were treasured, some were sealed in secret places, and some were directly exiled to another dimension.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if an alien race is lucky enough to find a part, it is difficult to piece together a complete artifact. It can be said that once these racial artifacts fall into the hands of humans, they will basically be useless.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, there are exceptions. As long as the artifact is not so picky about the owner and the human race can use it normally, they can escape.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Without the inherited artifact, many methods could not be used. Otherwise, the eighth-level strongman could use the artifact to fight against the Holy Land.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If it is in the hands of a strong person in the Holy Land, its power will be even greater.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     ...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Everyone, from the intelligence we have gathered so far, there are three possible locations where the orc heritage holy land will be born this time, in the areas controlled by the bear people, lion people, and elephant people.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There is no doubt that at least two things here are false.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Unfortunately, the orcs were deliberately divided into three waves, and now we have no way to verify it further."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Hudson said helplessly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     He originally thought that by tracking the movements of talented young people from various races, he would be able to find the location of the place of inheritance, but he never expected that the enemy would do this to him.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Originally, only one hundred people from each race were needed to participate, but this time each of the major orc races selected three hundred people, and some of the smaller races almost sent out their entire tribe.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The intelligence department has worked very hard, but except for a few high-ranking orcs who know the truth, the many races below are all confused.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Your Excellency Marshal, I heard that to participate in the Orc Heritage Trial, one must be a genius. Can you work hard on this?"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After hearing Archbishop Terran's question, Hudson shook his head and replied, "Archbishop, there is no specific standard for genius.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Some small races are just short of having the entire clan participate. It's impossible that all of their clan members are geniuses, right?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Combined with the analysis of intelligence collected from the Orc Empire, I think it is a fallacy that those who participate in the inheritance trial must be geniuses.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The truth is that all orcs can participate, but geniuses have a higher chance of obtaining the inheritance. Each tribe sends talented children to participate, in fact, they are competing for a higher success rate.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, the Beast God also has his status. If anyone can inherit it, it would be too cheap.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     According to previous statistics, as long as the orcs who received the inheritance did not die young, they could at best become eighth-rank warriors, and the probability of breaking through the holy realm was also very high. "
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Hudson's reinterpretation of the orc heritage trial left everyone stunned.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If this inference is correct, then all their previous inherent understandings about the matter would be overturned.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although they were unwilling to accept it in their hearts, their reason told them that this explanation was the most reliable.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There has never been a specific standard for "genius". Just by looking at performance in youth, no one can be sure which member of the tribe is the most talented.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     No matter how you screen, no matter what criteria you use, there is no way to guarantee that the one hundred geniuses you choose are the most talented in the clan.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Not to mention the holy land of inheritance left by the Beast God, even if he came here in person, he would probably not be able to select the best seedlings from so many orcs.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "If that's the case, things are going to be troublesome!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marshal, I wonder what plans you have for the next move?"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Archbishop Terran asked solemnly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     A sneak attack can also be regarded as a military operation. Since it is a military operation, we naturally have to listen to the opinions of professionals.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "There is no other way, we can only improvise and try our luck.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     We'll see how the enemy reacts. No matter how much we fake it, it won't be exactly the same. We'll attack the side with more high-ranking officials and more main forces in the Orc Empire.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even if we cannot destroy the enemy's heritage site, killing some of the orc high-ranking officials will not be in vain.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Another plan is to directly capture the elites of each race regardless of whether the orcs' heritage land has been revealed.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As long as we are fast enough and take care of one of the routes first, it will definitely cause panic among the orcs.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then just look for opportunities in the chaos!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Hudson said expressionlessly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Originally, he wanted to wipe out some of the smaller races so that the orcs would not have enough races to open the holy land. Hudson even sent people to find out the locations of the various races.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Unexpectedly, the enemy was well prepared. Before the kingdom could take action, the selected talented boys and girls dispersed and left the tribe.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is really difficult to find a team on the vast grassland.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     What's more, it is in the enemy's territory and there is no way to track it.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When it comes to professional issues, Archbishop Tyron is completely confused. Robert next to him knows a little, but that's just a little, and he can't give reliable advice.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The other four saints came to help. They were not familiar with the situation in the Orc Empire at all and were distracted from the beginning.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     No one had any opinions, so the decision-making power fell to Hudson. As this matter was of great importance, he did not dare to make a decision on his own.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, the information was collected too smoothly. We are not afraid that two of the three locations are false, but we are afraid that all three locations are false.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If the direction is chosen wrong, no matter how perfect the plan is, it will not play its due role.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     ...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In order to ensure the smooth opening of the holy land of heritage, the various tribes of the Orc Empire have put in a lot of effort.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Everyone, the news of the opening of the holy land has been released.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Judging from the intelligence collected so far, the Alpha Kingdom has not yet mobilized its military. With just their standing army, it is not enough to launch an expedition, and it is basically certain that the enemy will not send troops.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If the enemy wants to sabotage us, we can only send experts to launch a surprise attack. Next, we will see if we can lure out the enemy's Saint Domain experts!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Bear King said in a low voice.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It should be a good thing that the Holy Land of Inheritance appeared in their own territory. Unfortunately, the situation is too bad now, and the Bear People cannot control the situation.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For the sake of safety, they had to release false news, advance the opening time of the holy land of inheritance, and lure the enemy to launch a sneak attack.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The strong men in the Holy Land cannot attack at will, this is a tacit understanding reached by all the major forces. However, as the human race continues to grow, the unspoken rules of the continent that were previously prevalent are no longer so easy to use.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When encountering a force that also has powerful saints, everyone will definitely abide by the rules.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, once the tacit understanding is broken, the strong men in the Holy Land will put aside their pride and directly carry out assassination, which no one can stand!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But the Orc Empire is an exception. As one of the top forces on the continent, they don't even have a strong Sanctuary master in charge. It's incredible to imagine.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Without a strong person of the same level to restrain them, it means that they lack the means to overturn the table. Even if they suffer a loss, they can only seek help from the alien alliance.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As an ally, there is no problem in helping out, but the help is also limited. At most, the two sides reach an agreement that the human race's holy domain strongmen will no longer attack ordinary orcs.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And then there was nothing else. It was already very difficult to strive for peace. If they wanted to punish the human sanctuary that had attacked them earlier, that could only happen in their dreams.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although this kind of illegal move is likely to happen only once, even if it happens once, it is still fatal.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Lure out the enemy is secondary. The key is to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey" and let the human race know that the Orc Empire is not their back garden and they can come whenever they want.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Don't worry, Emperor Xiong. The enemy will definitely jump out. We finally have an advantage. The Alphas don't want us to get the inheritance.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The only problem now is that the number of enemy sanctuary masters is uncontrollable.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Apart from Hudson who is out in the open, there has been no news of the birth of a powerful Sanctuary in the Alpha Kingdom so far. This is obviously abnormal!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     With their background, they will do their best to support the one with the highest probability of breakthrough, and they will have a high probability of entering the holy realm.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is basically certain that, in addition to Hudson, there is at least one Saint Realm expert in the Alpha Kingdom."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>

     The words of Silver Moon Wolf King made the orcs look ugly. Being uncontrollable is always the most annoying thing, but humans like to hide it.

     If someone in the Orc Empire broke through the holy land, I'm afraid they would want to spread the news to the whole continent.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This is determined by interests. The human race can hide and ambush others, but it is different in the Orc Empire. Here, they particularly worship the strong.

     The name of a sanctuary alone can attract a large group of followers and bring tangible benefits.

     "It's useless to worry about it. What's coming will eventually come. Anyway, everyone has prepared substitutes and waits for the situation to develop. By the way, we can also find out the bottom line of the Alpha Kingdom.

   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The main reason is that we are isolated in a corner of the continent and have no say in the alliance. Otherwise, how could we allow the enemy to be so presumptuous! "

     The Eagle King said angrily.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As one of the top three forces in the alien alliance in terms of comprehensive strength, it is infuriating to think that they do not even have the most basic right to speak.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Unfortunately, being angry can't solve the problem. He has no say in the alliance. In the final analysis, it's because his ancestors didn't know how to behave and betrayed their allies for the sake of immediate interests.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although it happened at the end of the war, the outcome of each battlefield had been decided, and whether or not to compromise with the human race could not change the outcome of the war; but betrayal is betrayal!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After this incident, the Orc Empire, which already had a bad reputation on the continent, became completely infamous among the alien alliance.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When your reputation is bad, it is difficult to do anything. No one buys into your ideas, so naturally you have no say.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You don't work hard to maintain relationships with your allies at ordinary times, and only jump out when they need help. Why should they work hard for you?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For example, in this incident, after they asked for help from the alien alliance, the reply they received was: wait until the strong men from the human sanctuary take action!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There is nothing wrong with it. It is something that has not happened, so naturally there is no way to help. What if the Alpha Kingdom has no intention of taking action? Wouldn't that be a humiliation for themselves?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Eagle King is right. The situation is out of control now, so why not worry about it less?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The alliance's situation is special, and it is not necessarily reliable to place too much hope on them. If you want to permanently solve the problem, you still need to become stronger yourself.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, no matter how many enemies come, we must leave at least one Saint Domain strongman behind, so that we can take this opportunity to deter the enemy and cover the smooth opening of the inheritance holy land."

     The Lion King followed closely and said.
    </font>
   </font>

  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Watching the high-spirited performance of the four emperors, the seven kings who attended the meeting were very embarrassed. This kind of thing was too out of scope, and they had never been involved in it before.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The only one who was involved was the Behemoth King, but because of his embarrassing identity, he had to reduce his presence as much as possible in such occasions.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     They watched the four emperors finalize everything without asking their opinions, and the other kings came back to their senses.

     I wanted to speak up to object, but I was not familiar with the business, had never seen such a big scene, and could not come up with a better solution, so I could only follow the crowd.
