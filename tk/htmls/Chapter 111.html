<p>  Looking at the murderous formation, you can tell that it is definitely not a business in the past, but it seems to be smashing the scene.</p>
<p>   There is no other way, the next thing you do will be more or less hateful, if you don’t bring more people to protect you, it is very likely that you will be beaten by others.</p>
<p>   Walking all the way and gathering together, when the team arrived in Dadir City, the total number of people had exceeded the 2,000 mark. All the local nobles who could drop by along the way gathered here.</p>
<p>   It is not to mention that the soldiers are strong and the horses are strong, but the large number of people shows a bit. Eating Baron Beatsis is a joke, but demonstrations in the past were real.</p>
<p>  Under the efforts of Hudson, the military strength of the local nobles in the two counties has undergone a round of skyrocketing in a short period of time.</p>
<p>  Although we don’t know how much the specific strength and combat effectiveness have increased, the number of troops has indeed increased. If the previous conflict happened again, it would at least cause more casualties to the northern nobles.</p>
<p>   It just so happens that it is the slack season for farming. Except for a certain lord who is working hard to open up wasteland, the people under his command are still busy, and everyone else is free.</p>
<p>  Select the strongest serfs, pick up the most elite weapons, hold an armed parade to strengthen their courage, and boost the morale of the local nobles, which is also one of the main purposes of this operation.</p>
<p>   "Welcome everyone from afar, my baron has prepared a banquet, all distinguished guests are invited to join me.</p>
<p>  The entourage, please follow the guidance of the soldiers and go to the camp in the south of the city. Dinner is also prepared over there, and everyone can enjoy it to their heart's content. "</p>
<p>   From the trembling eyebrows of the old man, it can be seen that although he knew that there would be many people coming this time, he obviously did not expect that the local nobles would bring so many people.</p>
<p>   Didn’t it mean that the southern aristocrats are the most particular about food? Even if they want to make trouble, they should restrain themselves on the surface. Why don’t they play cards according to common sense this time?</p>
<p>   Before I had time to think about it, the moment I stopped at the gate of the city, several teams came from behind, as if they had made an appointment.</p>
<p>   There was no accident, everyone brought a large group of people over, as if there were fewer people, and it seemed that they had no face.</p>
<p>   Repeated what he said just now, before he had time to take everyone away, another team arrived one after another.</p>
<p>  Don't doubt it anymore, now the old man can be sure that this group of local nobles arrived together at the appointed time.</p>
<p>  It's useless to know, people came to participate in the event after receiving invitations, so you can't turn people away, right?</p>
<p>   To become a commercial center, super inclusiveness is a must. If you drive guests out of the door for no reason, your reputation will be bad.</p>
<p>  The nobles in twos and threes greeted each other, but turned a deaf ear to the old man's words, as if they regarded him as air. The old man was so angry that he was furious, but reason kept him calm.</p>
<p>   "Where's your Sith Baron? So many of us have come from afar, shouldn't his master come out to greet him?"</p>
<p>  Hudson's voice broke the atmosphere of the scene.</p>
<p>  Frankly speaking, Hudson has never bothered to do this kind of deliberate finding of faults and hatred.</p>
<p>   It's just that people are in the rivers and lakes, and they can't help themselves. Don't look at the local nobles present talking and laughing together, as if everyone is united. If you really want them to confront Baron Sith head-on, I'm afraid few will have the guts.</p>
<p>  The fact that Hudson can easily become the team leader is enough to explain everyone's position.</p>
<p>  Follow the wave of the flag and shout, and it is no problem to help the venue when the wind is down. It would be too embarrassing for them to stand up against Baron Sith.</p>
<p>   Even if there is arrogance in the heart, it has been almost consumed in the previous conflict. It can be said that the previous strong prestige of the northern Xinjiang nobles was still very successful.</p>
<p>  The current commotion is actually a bluff, and by the way, he cheers himself up.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, you are still so impatient! It's just that I came a little late, but I don't mean to disrespect everyone.</p>
<p>  The main reason is that there are too many guests here today, and I am really too busy, so I am a little late. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>   Now, all distinguished guests, please join me in the table! "</p>
<p>  If you carry a gun with a stick, it will make the scene even more embarrassing. It can be seen that this Sith Baron is not a master who swallows his anger. Even if it was their own home court, they didn't save face for the "guests".</p>
<p>  All the local nobles stopped and waited for Hudson's reaction, as if preparing to advance and retreat together.</p>
<p>   "I know that the Baron Sith is proud, and he won't be rude about these details. Since the Baron Sith is ready, then we don't have to be polite, let's do as we please!"</p>
<p>   While speaking, a huge team suddenly appeared in the sky. All kinds of orcs appeared, instantly attracting everyone's attention.</p>
<p>  Fortunately, this is the southeast province. If this scene happened in the north, everyone would have to think it was an army of orcs attacking the city.</p>
<p>   "Baron Sith, I am not late, am I? In order to support you, I brought all the best slaves here, and I am going to sell them for a good price with precious land."</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley's words instantly ignited everyone's laughter. Everywhere you look, there are ratmen, piggies, goblins, and other garbage slaves, and they still say they are "good".</p>
<p>  Because of selling slaves, this humble baron has recently "raised fame" among the local nobles.</p>
<p>   It's just not a good reputation, but was crowned "the stupidest slave trader". Contempt is contempt, but it does not affect everyone watching jokes.</p>
<p>  Listening to everyone's laughter, Baron Sith finally forcibly suppressed his anger. No matter what, you can't make trouble with your "little brother" in front of outsiders.</p>
<p>  Although Baron Kettley never thought of him as his younger brother, as the boss introduced by the nobles who traveled south and north, Baron Sith had already acquiesced that these people were all his younger brothers.</p>
<p>   "It's not too late, Ketley, it's great if you can come. Since you're here, let's take a seat together! Steward Faerun, arrange for someone to build a barracks in the west of the city to house these orc slaves."</p>
<p>   As soon as the voice fell, Baron Sith turned around and walked at the front of the team, as if he was leading the way for everyone.</p>
<p>   It can be seen that he was really **** off this wave. It was no secret in noble circles that Baron Kettley's slaves were unsalable, and Baron Sith had also heard of it.</p>
<p>   Seeing the bad luck of the guy with whom he had a feud, he secretly rejoiced more than once. You know, it was only a little bit short, and the title of "stupidest slave trader" fell to him.</p>
<p>   Fortunately, the experienced old butler stopped him in time and carefully analyzed the sales prospect of orc slaves for him. As expected, it was still unsalable.</p>
<p>   It's a pity that I escaped the first day of junior high school, but failed to escape the fifteenth day. After all, this trouble fell on him in another way.</p>
<p>  According to the original plan, a group of local nobles were placed in the south of the city, and the children of the northern Xinjiang nobles were placed in the north of the city, separating the two sides to reduce conflicts.</p>
<p>  The plan is very good, now there are a group of slaves, and a new city has to be divided out.</p>
<p>   It's not a question of whether they can't live, but the gap between the status of slaves and nobles is too great. If they were placed together forcibly, the nobles who felt insulted would have to turn against him on the spot.</p>
<p>  If it's just this little trouble, he, Baron Sith, will admit it. There are only a few hundred barracks on the left and right, and they are all lowly slaves anyway. If you just circle around and deal with them, you can't waste a few pieces of wood.</p>
<p>   Even if these guys are allowed to eat and drink for nothing for three days, they will lose tens of thousands of pounds of food at most, which Baron Sith can afford.</p>
<p>   Obviously, things can't be that simple. In the huge commodity exchange meeting, more than 20,000 slaves participated in the transaction, and the last slave was not traded. Just think about how embarrassing the scene can be.</p>
<p>  If this expensive event is publicized by the guests, it will directly become a farce.</p>
<p>   The people who eat melons don’t care why the slaves are unsalable, they will only take it for granted that the commercial market in Dadir City is not good. At that time, it will be "open your mouth to spread rumors, and lose your legs when you refute them."</p>
<p>   Originally thought that the biggest trouble was caused by the local nobles headed by Hudson, but they did not expect that the real trouble was being stabbed in the back by "my family".</p>
<p>   It is difficult to invite God, but it is even more difficult to send God off!</p>
<p>   In front of a group of local nobles, he couldn't refuse the entry of Baron Kettley's team. It is even more impossible to drive people away now.</p>
<p>  With his mind on his mind, Sith was out of state throughout the banquet. After a few polite words, he left the banquet hall on the pretext of feeling unwell.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Master, the situation is not good! Looking at Baron Kettley's actions, it seems to be a bit of a pinch. Maybe he really colluded with the local nobles and deliberately came here to cause sabotage.</p>
<p>   After all, so many slaves fall into the hands. If it can't be dealt with in time, the finances led by Maple Leaf won't last long.</p>
<p>  Even if the family behind him is willing to provide support, but to fill the hole of 40,000 to 50,000 gold coins at one time, I am afraid it will attract opposition from many clansmen.</p>
<p>   Now those who have financial resources and need to eat these slaves are only a group of local nobles.</p>
<p>   Driven by interests, it is not impossible for Baron Kettley to choose to betray. This situation must be contained, otherwise the consequences will be unpredictable. "</p>
<p>   Butler Faerun analyzed solemnly.</p>
<p>  Foreign enemies on the side, and internal strife again, for Baron Sith, it is definitely a big event that the sky is about to fall.</p>
<p>   Betrayal is something that people are most afraid of setting a precedent. Once Baron Kettley is won over by the local nobles, there will definitely be more nobles who will choose to defect.</p>
<p>  Anyway, for most of the northern Xinjiang aristocratic children who went south, the most important thing for them is to gain a firm foothold in the local area and leave a way for the family.</p>
<p>   As for whether the northern Xinjiang nobles or the local nobles will be in charge of the two counties in the future, they are actually insignificant in terms of survival.</p>
<p>   As long as you have taken root in the local area for three generations and married the local nobles a few times, you are considered your own.</p>
<p>  Similar cases have been staged long ago in history. Including the Koslow family also originated from the North, but now everyone regards them as local nobles.</p>
<p>  A single tree cannot make a forest. If the younger brothers turn against each other, no matter how powerful he is, he will not be able to resist the general trend.</p>
<p>   Not to mention that he is competing for the dominance of the two counties, and if he can not be squeezed out from the local area, it is his means!</p>
<p>   "I'll talk to Baron Kettley, and if it doesn't work, I'll find a way to get everyone to pool a sum of money and lend him an emergency.</p>
<p>  As for these slaves, help digest as much as they can!</p>
<p>   If you push people into a hurry, with this guy's style, betray us as traitors, he can really do it. "</p>
<p>   Baron Sith said indifferently.</p>
<p>   It seems that he decided to help, but deep down he was already thinking about how to find a chance to get rid of Baron Kettley's shit.</p>
<p>  Those who are horizontal are afraid of being stunned, and those who are stunned are afraid of dying.</p>
<p>  The current Baron Kettley was forced to a dead end, and directly played the broken pot. Either help him out, or he'll drag everyone to hell.</p>
<p>  Anyway, Baron Sith promised to help store the goods. If the slaves in his hands cannot be disposed of for a long time, Kettley will be able to put more than 20,000 slaves here for free.</p>
<p>   Unless Baron Sith can let go of his previous plan, don't set up any commercial center, and hand over the geographical advantages of Dardir City to others. Otherwise, he would have to deal with this hot potato.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  In the banquet hall, there is no host, and everyone's enthusiasm will not be affected at all. In particular, the singing and dancing full of exotic customs attracted the attention of everyone.</p>
<p>  Many nobles even made requests to Baron Kettley to buy exotic beauties in front of him. It's just that in the end everyone was scared back by Keitele's conditions.</p>
<p>   It is okay to buy alien beauties, but the prerequisite is that you must package and subscribe to a certain number of orc slaves.</p>
<p>  Everyone has experienced this kind of routine, but Hudson used to attach pots and pans and other daily necessities, so you won’t suffer too much when you buy them back.</p>
<p>   But the orc slaves are different, everyone has no experience in raising this group of aliens. What if a slave riot occurs and these noble nobles are killed?</p>
<p>  Thanks to the kingdom’s hundreds of years of demonizing orc propaganda, in the deepest memory of many nobles, orcs are a group of super destructive and lunatics.</p>
<p>   No matter how much everyone is interested in beauties from other races, it is impossible to pack and buy a thousand for a woman and go back.</p>
<p>  Compared to the gaffes of his colleagues, Hudson is much calmer. Isn't it just a hot dance? It's not like I haven't seen it before.</p>
<p>  Although the group of exotic beauties on the stage were indeed moving, his reason told him that he must remain reserved now.</p>
<p>   Not only Hudson, but all the unmarried noble children are trying to restrain their emotions.</p>
<p>  Just because others can be crazy doesn’t mean they can be crazy too. If you lose your temper during the banquet and fall into the eyes of a group of people who may be the future father-in-law, it will be a big penalty.</p>
<p>  With the reputation of being greedy and lustful, it is almost impossible to find an ideal marriage.</p>
<p>  Most of the noble children are restrained before marriage, and mess around after marriage. Including those noble ladies are no exception, very few people have **** before marriage.</p>
<p>  If the couple’s life after marriage is not harmonious, and the husband’s family is not strong enough, then it is easy to have a green prairie.</p>
<p>   A lot of fun, so the husband and wife can play separately, and no one will affect the other. In some areas with an open atmosphere, it is even possible to hold an open meeting to have fun together.</p>
<p>  Watching an old guy walk onto the stage without any scruples and flirt with those interracial beauties, Hudson silently chose his side.</p>
<p>   I can't stay here any longer, it's someone else's territory after all, if I accidentally get tricked and someone arranges an affair, it's hard to tell.</p>
<p>  If someone observes carefully, he will find that Hudson will shake his sleeve near his sleeve every time he drinks or eats.</p>
<p>   For no other reason, he brought a master poison detector with him. The mini version of the bear is printed on the clothes like a pattern, and it is actually a cub that follows closely.</p>
<p>  With the continuous growth of strength, Bear Stearns has also unlocked many abilities. Whether it is transformation or poison recognition, it is one of its talents.</p>
<p>   As for the price, all the energy in Hudson’s mysterious compass is exhausted. Now, one thousand gold coins of magic crystals have to be purchased every month to replenish energy for the compass, so as to guarantee the daily practice of one person and one bear.</p>
<p>   Reason told him that this was just the beginning. With the absorption capacity of a bear with a big stomach, the demand for energy will be even greater in the future.</p>
<p>   Fortunately, Hudson was smart enough to arrange for himself the status of a magician in advance, which reasonably occupied the magic spar exchange quota of many relatives.</p>
<p>   This wave is free, and you won’t be able to use it anyway, so just support the children of outstanding families. The quota was given to Hudson, but he still had to pay for the gold coins himself.</p>
<p>   It is a pity that Hudson has never figured out the specific strength of the cub. Anyway, according to Bear Stearns, the nobles around him are not enough to slap Mr. Xiong in the face.</p>
<p>  The division of specific strength levels is the product of human beings' refinement based on their own understanding and needs.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that the Earth Bear family never engage in those boring things, only the three stages of infancy, growth, and adulthood.</p>
<p>  The strength span of each stage is also very different. Because according to the understanding of the Earth Bear, combat power can usually be judged by looking at the size.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, the cub is obviously an outlier. Although his strength is gradually rising, and his talent and supernatural powers are constantly being unlocked, but judging from his size, he is still in his infancy.</p>
<p>  If Bear Stearns didn't cover up and showed his real body directly, anyone who saw it would probably think it was an unweaned brat.</p>
<p>   It is true that it has not been weaned. Honey + animal milk has always been its necessary food, and it has to drink a pot of the same volume as its body every day.</p>
<p>  It seems to be the lifeblood of Xiongsheng, whoever dares to wean it will be in a hurry with whoever. If this situation continues, it is estimated that Hudson will not see the bear weaned in his lifetime.</p>
<p>   Reason told Hudson that it was time to find a way to make money. You can't ignore your essential work just because you want to play against Baron Sith.</p>
