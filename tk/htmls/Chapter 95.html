Everything is as he expected, and it will not be easy to be able to secure the position of one of the princes.</p>
<p>  Earl Pierce's performance in suppressing the Skull and Bones rebellion was far from enough. Since there are shortcomings in the military, it must be made up for in other aspects.</p>
<p>  On the surface, it seems that it is just an excuse, but the deep meaning in essence is not as simple as it is on the surface.</p>
<p>  Just imposing a fine can only be regarded as indifferent to the nobles. But that's only for the veteran lords, who have stable financial resources and can afford financial punishment.</p>
<p>  But for the newly promoted lords, that is completely two concepts. Almost all the territories in Wright and Wyton counties are unable to make ends meet.</p>
<p>   More than 90% of the territories now only have expenditures and no income.</p>
<p>   This is a state of sitting and eating, and everyone wants to break a gold coin into two halves, and then encounter a huge fine, that is, the leak in the house happens to rain overnight.</p>
<p>  Although all the lords are noble N generations, this does not mean that the family resources will be infinitely tilted towards them.</p>
<p>  If a family wants to pass it on for a long time, the most important thing is the rules. Outstanding children can certainly take away more resources, but children from other families are not dead, and can also share a share.</p>
<p>   On the premise of ensuring that the strength of the family is not affected first, the support that everyone can get is not unlimited.</p>
<p>   Hudson has a deep understanding of this point. His father's territory is not bad. There are tens of thousands of gold coins in every year, and there is no large-scale development of armaments. Logically speaking, it should be very nourishing.</p>
<p>   But the fact is just the opposite. Because of too many brothers and sisters and scattered resources, life is very ordinary instead.</p>
<p>  There is no way, the expenses are all on the bright side, and you can figure it out by stretching out your fingers. The total income is indeed a lot. If there is no dream, the family's life of luxury and money can be maintained.</p>
<p>  But once there is a pursuit, the expenses will rise.</p>
<p>  The daily expenses of the territory account for 60% of the income, including production input, infrastructure investment, the operation of the baron's mansion, taxes, guards...</p>
<p>  Of the remaining 40% of the income, nearly 10% is spent on social expenses and entertainment. The other 30% of income is real disposable income.</p>
<p>   Half of the money has to be set aside as a reserve to deal with sudden changes such as wars and famines. The support needed by children like Hudson to start a business is all spent from this reserved fund.</p>
<p>   Savings, that is, when their brothers were young. As you get older, there are more places to spend your money.</p>
<p>  The eldest son inherits the family business, but it does not mean that the second son does not need help. At the very least, you have to provide some financial support when you first leave the house, and you have to bear a certain amount of expenses when it's time to get married.</p>
<p>  Only relying on self-struggle, it is estimated that there are leftover men and women everywhere.</p>
<p>  When a daughter gets married, she also needs to give a dowry.</p>
<p>   From the time the first child gets married to the youngest child settles major personal affairs, basically don’t even think about having any savings during this period.</p>
<p>  The reason why the nobles in northern Xinjiang have strong military strength is because they have cut off most of their interpersonal expenses, and their weddings and funerals are also kept simple.</p>
<p>  Even the reserves are only available to families with some strength. A small family can achieve a balance of income and expenditure, which is considered a good year.</p>
<p>  In order to make up for the shortfall, in addition to actively participating in smuggling activities, they have to participate in slave hunting operations from time to time, going deep into the orc empire to plunder.</p>
<p>  Don’t look at the children of northern Xinjiang nobles who went south, it seems that all of them are worth a lot of money. In fact, a large part of it is earned by them on the family platform and by exerting their personal talents.</p>
<p>   Either develop a smuggling business, or directly lead a team out to plunder.</p>
<p>   Being able to make money is also an important criterion for the nobles of the Northland to evaluate the potential of the younger generation.</p>
<p>   All the children of northern Xinjiang nobles who were able to go south are the best among them. At least he led the team to carry out more than five slave hunting operations, and escaped unscathed.</p>
<p>   Failure does not exist, because the losers are already dead. People will only remember the winners, no one cares about the life and death of the losers.</p>
<p>  Even the official statistics on the death rate of the nobles only count those whose bodies can be found. Those who went deep into the orc empire and never returned are all judged as missing.</p>
<p>  Whether it is a Woohoo or a slave in the Orc Empire, no one knows, anyway, the end result is very miserable.</p>
<p>   Also being fined, the condition of the local nobles is much better. On the one hand, the way of getting the money is different, on the other hand, because of the loss, the fines are mostly symbolic.</p>
<p>  Even Lord Hudson, who was fined the worst, paid the fine without blinking an eye. Others have single-digit or double-digit fines, and there is no need to be sad.</p>
<p>  Northern Xinjiang nobles feel differently. In addition to family sponsorship, there is also a lot of hard-earned money earned by their own lives.</p>
<p>  It's all money, and it must be hard-earned money when it goes out, at least deep down they think so.</p>
<p>  Flesh pain is second. The key is that after the financial resources are weakened, the development of the territory is also greatly affected.</p>
<p>  In order to reduce fines, and in exchange for local nobles lifting the blockade, many nobles were forced to return most of the robbed population.</p>
<p>   I'm almost out of cooking, I really can't afford to support so many people, and I can't do it without compromise.</p>
<p>   After a lot of tossing, all the wallets that had the strength to make a fuss were dry. These people don't have the capital to make a fuss without recuperating for a few years.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Hudson, haven't you made less money recently?"</p>
<p>   Knight Adrian said enviously.</p>
<p>   They are also strugglers. The efforts of their father and son for two generations were lucky enough to get a piece of land, and Hudson reached the height he looked up to when he appeared on the stage.</p>
<p>  In order to obtain resources for development, he even gave up the most valued face of the nobles. As a result, looking at his distant cousin, the gap between the two sides widened even further.</p>
<p> "Ha ha…"</p>
<p>   "A little business, just earning some hard money. Even this is not peaceful, and I worry about being missed.</p>
<p>  Adrian, you have gained a lot this time, right?</p>
<p>  The more than 7,000 people have passed Minglu this time, and they all belong to you. The funniest thing is that group of idiots who want to apologize and pay compensation to you.</p>
<p>  Although you don’t have much money, your name as Knight Adrian resounds throughout the two counties. Now who doesn’t know that you are the most difficult knight in the two counties! "</p>
<p>  It is indeed hard money, and it is hard work to collect money.</p>
<p>  The goods delivered, whether it was weapons and equipment, pots and pans, or various agricultural tools, were all sold out.</p>
<p>   The deposit alone is soft, and all the orders added up are enough to keep the territory busy for half a year.</p>
<p>  It is difficult to calculate the profit, but the payment received is as high as 8,000 gold coins, and there is also a deposit of 13,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>  If all subsequent products are sold, 35,000 gold coins will be credited.</p>
<p>   It is estimated that after this business is completed, all the investment in the early development of the territory will be paid back. If the cost control is good, you should still be able to make some money.</p>
<p>  The main reason is that the pockets of the customers are not rich. If Earl Pierce hadn’t slaughtered them first and weakened the purchasing power of the customers, the total number of orders might have increased by 8,000.</p>
<p>   It is precisely because of earning too much that there is this small family gathering. In order to prevent some guys from taking risks, Hudson also had to rely on family power.</p>
<p>  The main reason is that they did not expect to receive such a large deposit in advance. Hudson did not bring many troops, and more than 20,000 gold coins were enough to make some habitual criminals take risks. Especially Hudson offended someone this time.</p>
<p>   What was being transported was gold coins, and I was worried about asking outsiders to **** them, so I simply invited my own family members to **** them for a ride.</p>
<p>   "Many people are useless. It's not like you don't know about my family background. It's only a little better than Berio and Guarente, and it's incomparable with you, an upstart.</p>
<p>  It was okay to be fostered by the tribe, but then I sent it back to my territory. I don't even know how to solve the problem of eating.</p>
<p>   You can’t always borrow food, can you? From the time I got the territory to now, I owe a lot of favors. If I try to cause famine now, I really can't bear it! "</p>
<p>  Hearing the conversation between the two in Versailles, Baron Berio and the Knight of Guarente, who were eating melons, felt that they had been connoted, and glared directly.</p>
<p>  One is worried about money, and the other is worried about people. They don't dislike these troubles.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that this kind of thing can only be envious and jealous. I really want to ask for help, even if everyone is my own family, I have to settle the account.</p>
<p>   Just like Hudson hired them as guards this time, they all promised to pay each of them fifty to one hundred spears, and the price directly depends on their respective strengths.</p>
<p>   "Enough is enough for the two of you!</p>
<p>  This kind of good thing is too troublesome.</p>
<p>  The two of us don’t dislike it and are willing to help you share.</p>
<p>  Are you willing to share these troubles? "</p>
<p>   Baron Berio couldn't help but said.</p>
<p>  The Guarente knight on the side also nodded.</p>
<p>   It's too bullying, and it doesn't consider the feelings of the two poor ghosts at all. You must know that since inheriting the territory, the two have been relying on favors and famines to support them until now.</p>
<p>   Originally heard that Hudson was going to hire them as guards, and thought they could earn some pocket money to subsidize their family, but they didn't expect that when they came here, they would be greeted by a large Versailles scene.</p>
<p>   "No problem, I can credit you two hundred swords, one thousand spears, eighty hammers, fifty giant axes, three hundred cauldrons...</p>
<p>  Allow you to use physical offsets, and all accounts are paid at market prices. It will be settled within three years, and you will not be charged a copper coin interest. Is it enough to give you face? "</p>
<p>  Hudson unceremoniously sent the Dafa of changing the topic.</p>
<p>   Money cannot be divided, but weapons and equipment can still be supported. They are all members of the Koslow family. No matter which branch's military strength is strengthened, it means that the family's voice in the local area will increase, which is good for everyone.</p>
<p>   As for daily necessities such as farm tools, it can only be regarded as incidental. The utilitarianism that can be concealed by being mixed together shows his heroism of Baron Hudson.</p>
<p>  Anyway, the current market price is not low. Even if the payment is made in installments of three years, the business is still profitable.</p>
<p>   "Hudson, you can't treat them differently, I also want to pay on credit.</p>
<p>   You must know that I have offended many people this time, if I don’t strengthen my strength, I will suffer a lot later! "</p>
<p>   Before the two could answer, Adrian, who couldn't sit still, jumped out first. The reason why it was sold so badly earlier was to get a discount when buying weapons.</p>
<p>  Now you can pay on credit, and you can pay in kind, that would be great.</p>
<p>   This time, the bad neighbors have been offended terribly. A temporary cessation does not mean a permanent peace. Sooner or later, everyone will still face each other.</p>
<p>   It is impossible for Adrian to lie flat all the time. The territory still needs to be built after all. If he does not expect to suffer a big loss, he must first improve his military strength.</p>
<p>   It is not extravagant to expect to be able to hang and beat up a group of neighbors, at least it must be able to deter them and make them fearful.</p>
<p>   "Credit, no problem! But Adrian, you have so many people, can a knight afford it?"</p>
<p>   Hudson asked tentatively.</p>
<p>  Although the territory has a population of more than 10,000, not only has his desire for population not diminished, but it has become more intense with the increase in his pockets.</p>
<p>  Although the Salam Mountain Range is a hilly area, since it has been crowned with a mountain range, the area is naturally not small. Nominally, the mountainous area is only more than 170 square kilometers, but in fact, the land available for development can be increased by ten times.</p>
<p>   Of course, this development is not limited to farming. Just farming, it would be nice to have one-third of the land that can be developed.</p>
<p>   In terms of the utilization rate of agricultural land, the hilly areas are far behind the plains.</p>
<p>  After all, with the current productivity, it is only suitable for extensive planting and low harvest, and intensive cultivation can starve people to death.</p>
<p> "Ha ha…"</p>
<p>   "Hudson, I don't need to worry about this. Although my territory only has one knight realm, don't forget that those who are responsible for dividing the territory are all my colleagues.</p>
<p>   If you don’t move the boundary line seven or eight miles around, is it worthy of the friendship I have worked with them for many years? If it is managed well, it will be no worse than ordinary barons. "</p>
<p>   Adrian said proudly.</p>
<p>  The border moved seven or eight miles to the outside world, and the area of ​​the Knights' Territory was directly doubled several times, and it was even possible to catch up with the Barony's Territory.</p>
<p>  When other people encounter such a good thing, they hide it one by one, lest they spread it and cause trouble. Including Hudson, who took advantage of the territorial division process, they were all worried for a while.</p>
<p>  Adrian was able to speak out freely, without any fear of hatred.</p>
<p>   This is the biggest benefit of being surrounded by the boss, even if the area of ​​the territory far exceeds the specification, it can still be covered. It's useless to report, and Earl Pierce will suppress the governor's mansion if he makes a fuss.</p>
<p>   You can't bring the lawsuit to the king because of the territorial issue of a knight's domain, right?</p>
<p>  In the feudal era, the bosses were not afraid of such things being exposed. If it really gets out, it will be a publicity for them, and it will increase the attraction to talents.</p>
<p>   "Hudson, if you are really short of people, go to the branches of the family to ask for alms!</p>
<p>  There are so many that I dare not say, it is not a problem for one family to scrape together dozens of serf households for you. Especially those big households, who donated three to five hundred households without blinking an eye.</p>
<p>  If you think it’s not enough, you can go to your relative’s house for a walk. Anyway, there are not many other things in our family, that is, we have many relatives and friends.</p>
<p>  As long as you have a thicker skin, one-tenth of the nobles in the kingdom can get some connections, and you can gather as many people as you want.</p>
<p>  Anyway, your kid has a solid family background, so just pay them the price of slaves in the market. "</p>
<p>  After listening to Adrian's suggestion, Hudson rolled his eyes directly. Does this have anything to do with relatives? It's all based on the price of slaves in the market, so he might as well just buy slaves directly.</p>
<p>  The problem is that the price of slaves has skyrocketed, and even Hudson is in pain. But now everyone knows that he is doing well, and the price can't be negotiated. Otherwise, the transaction becomes a debt of favor.</p>
<p>  Hudson doesn't want to fight with people every now and then. If he owes a debt of favor, he has to bring dry food to help the scene as soon as he is greeted.</p>
<p>  If it’s just these things, it’s not unacceptable, and it’s not a loss to pay off a debt of favor after a fight. What I am most afraid of is that the opponent in the fight is also one of our own, and it will be embarrassing at that time.</p>
<p>  With the complex relationship network of the Koslow family, there is a high probability that this kind of thing will happen. As far as Hudson could remember, Baron Redman was invited to mediate no fewer than five such conflicts a year.</p>
<p>   The result of the mediation is unknown. Anyway, Baron Redman is exhausted every time he comes back, and he often shuts himself up.</p>
<p>   "Adrian, you have a wide range of contacts, help me spread the news in the circle, I am willing to exchange iron tools for serfs.</p>
<p>  Whether it is weapons and equipment or daily iron daily necessities, as long as they can be produced in the territory, they can let them choose.</p>
<p>  The exchange is based on the market price, and the transportation cost is mine. "</p>
<p>   Hudson said helplessly.</p>
<p>  Although the price of iron products is also high, it is still far from the price of slaves flying in the sky.</p>
<p>  The production of slaves is extremely unstable. Generally speaking, every time a war breaks out between human nations, the price of slaves will drop sharply. If there is peace for a few years, the price will go up again.</p>
<p>  Alpha Kingdom seldom engages in wars with human countries, but often fights with orcs, so the slave market is dominated by orcs, and human slaves are all imported from abroad.</p>
<p>  After the rebellion of the Skull and Bones, the human slaves on the market were quickly snapped up, and the orc slaves were mainly some special races.</p>
<p>  These races all have common characteristics, such as high appearance and weak combat effectiveness, they are mainly for the nobles to have fun.</p>
<p>  What kind of cat girl, fox girl, rabbit girl...not only the price is high, but also not suitable for farming or blacksmithing.</p>
<p>It is said that there are tauren, leopard, goblin, pigg, ratman... and hundreds of orc slaves in the north, but these guys are either violent, cunning, or too low in intelligence. The price/performance ratio is not high, and it is not popular in the market.</p>
<p>   Most of those with strong combat effectiveness were sold into the Colosseum, while those with low combat effectiveness were either reduced to magic materials in the hands of magicians, or became sacrifices to evil gods.</p>
<p>  In short, orc slaves cannot be counted on for the time being. If it can be used, the lords of the Northland will be the first to use it.</p>
<p>   Just follow suit, there is no need to be a guinea pig.</p>
<p>   Unable to suppress the price of slaves, Hudson can only hedge with the high value-added products produced by himself.</p>
<p>  In a sense, this can be regarded as opening up a new market, and it depends on whether everyone is willing to accept it.</p>
