<p>  In the Mountain Territory, Hudson is busy entertaining guests.</p>
<p>  After several months of hard work, although the castle still has no shadow, the temporary mansion was still built.</p>
<p>   With the right venue, there is a basis for holding a banquet.</p>
<p>   After all, you are a member of the aristocratic group, so how can you not hold a banquet?</p>
<p>  Compared to other regions, the nobles of Wright and Wyton counties are all representatives of thrift.</p>
<p>  It is rare for people like Hudson to hold a banquet for the first time after settling down for half a year, but there are not a few people who hold an event only once every month.</p>
<p>   They are all forced by "money".</p>
<p>   Except for a few wealthy families, most of the lords are facing financial crisis.</p>
<p>  With no money in his pocket, naturally he can't be proud. One of the important means is to reduce the expenses in all aspects and reduce the number of banquets held.</p>
<p>  Although it was the first time Hudson hosted a banquet, the number of guests attending the banquet was still small. It's not that there is a lack of people attending the banquet, the main reason is that Hudson only invited the twenty or so people in front of him.</p>
<p>  Without exception, all of them are not far away, and have some kind of friendship.</p>
<p>  An accident happened, and everyone can take care of each other. Mutual benefit is the core reason for the establishment of this emerging interest group.</p>
<p>  Hudson is in a good mood, and several friends have recommended talents to him. Although the timing was too coincidental, Master Hudson, who was seriously short of people, couldn't care less.</p>
<p>  There are more people and more things. Compared with other village chief lords with only a thousand people, the mountain leader is still the size of a big town.</p>
<p>  In a large town with a population of tens of thousands, there are only seven managers, all of whom are borrowed from outside.</p>
<p>   With such a small number of people, Hudson can maintain the normal operation of the territory, and Hudson admires his management ability.</p>
<p>  It's just that with the continuous development of the territory, there are more and more specific things that need to be planned and managed, and the number of people becomes insufficient.</p>
<p>   It’s not that Hudson didn’t cultivate talents by himself. The following chiefs and security chiefs are the “key talents” he cultivated painstakingly.</p>
<p>  It is not easy for a group of purely illiterate people to do a good job at the grassroots level. It is obviously unrealistic to expect them to grow up immediately.</p>
<p>  Limited cronies must also be placed in the army. Compared with administrative management, Hudson still pays more attention to the control of the army.</p>
<p>   This can be seen from the talents recruited. All the targets were administrative personnel, and no matter how talented the military commanders were, Master Hudson would not dare to use them.</p>
<p>  Although there are not many history books in the family, some experiences and lessons are still recorded. Countless heroes have failed in starting their own businesses, and the reason behind them is the betrayal of their subordinates.</p>
<p>  In troubled times, the army is the lifeline. The army is not chaotic, and everything has room for maneuver. Once there is a problem with the army, it can only rely on the blessing of the Lord of Dawn.</p>
<p>  Ability can be cultivated slowly, but loyalty must not be compromised. Anyway, there are only so few soldiers in total, as long as they can execute orders without compromise, that's enough.</p>
<p>   When it comes to military command ability, Hudson feels that his level of "talking about soldiers on paper" ranks high among a group of colleagues who only know how to charge stupidly.</p>
<p>   If you go to the battlefield a few more times and accumulate some actual combat experience, you might become a famous general in the mainland.</p>
<p>   He can only lead troops to charge in a stupid way. Hudson feels that recruiting these guys into the army is irresponsible to himself.</p>
<p>   Among the down-and-out aristocrats living abroad, there may be outstanding military talents, but Hudson doesn't think that he, a little baron, can recruit these great gods.</p>
<p>   On the contrary, it is easy to recruit administrators. As long as they have the level of those housekeepers, they can make do with it first.</p>
<p>  In the future, there will be more suitable candidates for replacement. If there are not enough talents, then wait until the elderly officers in the army retire.</p>
<p>  Who made Master Hudson afraid to promote compulsory education in the territory, so he could only secretly teach some officers to read and write in the army?</p>
<p>  In terms of knowledge dissemination, a tacit agreement has been reached within the aristocratic group, which only allows circulation in a small area.</p>
<p>   Not only serfs have no chance to learn knowledge, but also free people outside. Including many businessmen, also illiterate.</p>
<p>   This is not the worst. As far as Hudson knows, some down-and-out aristocratic lords have also become illiterate.</p>
<p>   If there is no one to help, if you want to regain knowledge, you will have to pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Hudson, do you really want to fight the Sith?"</p>
<p>   Adrian Knight deliberate question.</p>
<p>   It’s not a question of whether to support or not. They belong to the same family. On this issue, Adrian was divided into camps from the beginning.</p>
<p>  Raising his glass and taking a sip, Hudson said with great enjoyment, "Whether you want to fight with him or not is actually not about me, but whether everyone needs me to fight.</p>
<p>   Being pushed all the way to the present, it is no longer possible for me to quit just by saying quit.</p>
<p>  The farce in Wright County, this is a small episode in the big screen, and there must be more good dramas behind.</p>
<p>   If you don't want to be overturned by the storm, then find a way to increase your strength!</p>
<p>  There is not much time left for us, and we will try to accumulate as much as possible before the storm comes..."</p>
<p>  The further you get to the back, the lower the voice, even if the people nearby are considered "our own people", there are some words that Hudson still dare not say.</p>
<p>  This meeting seemed to be just an ordinary exchange, but in fact it was the formation of a new interest group.</p>
<p>  Although the group looks weak, Wright County is already considered a big force. Excluding other influences, it has barely been able to compete with the northern nobles in the county.</p>
<p>   "What a **** life!</p>
<p>  I don't know whether to envy you or pity you. But it can be seen that you are enjoying everything now.</p>
<p>  So can I understand that you are ready to deal with Baron Sith, or you have found a way to intervene in the face of the Felix family? "</p>
<p>   Adrian Knight looking forward to the question.</p>
<p>   Standing on the standpoint of the Koslow family, I naturally hope that Hudson can win this dispute.</p>
<p>  As long as Hudson seizes the position of sheriff and with the support of all the family lines, it won't take long for Hudson to gain a firm foothold among the middle-class nobles.</p>
<p>  After taking this step, the Koslow family can be regarded as the number one in the southeastern province. Even if you look at the entire kingdom, you have the most basic right to speak.</p>
<p>  The threshold for the kingdom's noble council is to start with a viscount, and you must have real power to be eligible to join.</p>
<p>  Although the right to speak is actually limited, nominally this is the highest authority of the Alpha Kingdom, capable of making decisions about the kingdom's major affairs.</p>
<p>  The most direct manifestation is that the safety is more secure. In case of being suppressed by the big nobles, you can still shout twice in the Kingdom Council.</p>
<p>   It is uncertain how much it can play, but as long as things are brought to the table, many things must be done according to the rules.</p>
<p>   This is also the reason why the Dalton family, although powerful, cannot cover the sky with one hand in the southeastern province.</p>
<p>   "Don't guess, I didn't say these words. If it spreads out and causes any bad influence, I won't admit it.</p>
<p>  Now there is only one thing I want to do, and that is to continuously enhance my own strength. Don't expect anything else, as long as the training of these two infantry regiments is completed, do you think it is important who is the county guard? "</p>
<p>   Hudson said with a sneer.</p>
<p>  Confidence is all compared. The weakness of his colleagues made Hudson more and more confident.</p>
<p>   What about strategizing, strategic layout... It's all nonsense. Most noble lords don't have any plans, just like ordinary people, they are purely day-to-day.</p>
<p>  The teammates selected by Hudson are basically this kind of stuff, and Adrian Cavaliers is considered the most thoughtful among them.</p>
<p>   Those powerful characters are unfortunately not within the scope of Master Hudson's wooing. To put it simply, don't take them to play together.</p>
<p>  Ability is not equal to strength. Before completing the original accumulation, no matter how awesome a guy is, he is no different from an ordinary person.</p>
<p>  Put them out of the circle and don't give them the opportunity to complete primitive accumulation. The general trend will soon teach them how to behave.</p>
<p>  The situation in Wright County is still unclear, but the pattern of confrontation between the two powers in Wright County is already very obvious. Whoever wants to become the third pole will be jointly attacked by the two major forces.</p>
<p>   Hudson has observed a moment of silence for the Baron Ezekiel. The ability is indeed very good, but it is a pity that his own strength cannot support his ambition.</p>
<p>   This is a grassroots tragedy. If you don't give it a go, it is estimated that everyone will not know that there is someone like him in Wright County.</p>
<p>  Painful planning, careful preparation, and dozens of times of effort, choosing the most appropriate time to give it a go, but in the end it was inevitable that he would be "destroyed ten times with one force" by Baron Sith.</p>
<p>   All calculations outside the battlefield are all victories, and all battles on the battlefield are all defeats.</p>
<p>  The strenuous resistance just made the story more tragic. Perhaps wandering poets love tragic heroes, but the aristocratic world does not sympathize with losers.</p>
<p>   In contrast, Hudson is much more wretched. In the early stage, he knew that his strength was not enough, so he stayed in the territory and ignored the outside world.</p>
<p>  The only big thing he did was trying to brag. Instead of going out to blow it out by yourself, but with the help of former colleagues.</p>
<p>  The stories of "true and false, false and true" are interspersed together, but they have deceived many people.</p>
<p>   It wasn't until the initial accumulation was completed and fame turned into strength that he slowly moved to the foreground.</p>
<p>   Half of the two infantry regiments cannot fight, but this does not affect the eyes of the outside world, these two infantry regiments are elite divisions.</p>
<p>  People always like to believe what their eyes see, so Hudson let everyone see "two elite infantry regiments".</p>
<p>  After all, how can the aristocratic gentlemen who are high above care about the transfer of personnel below.</p>
<p>  The first troupe has performed a long time ago, and now it is the second troupe that often shows up outside. In everyone's inherent cognition, the first group formed last year is more powerful.</p>
<p>   As everyone knows, Hudson just played a word game. The current first regiment is the recruit regiment. Except for a small number of personnel changes in the second regiment outside, 90% of the soldiers are from the original first regiment.</p>
<p>  The first regiment nests deep in the territory every day, conducting military training while guarding the orc slaves at work. They will not show up until they have trained a famous figure.</p>
<p>   Once again, the bluff succeeded, directly establishing the confrontation between the two strong teams in Wright County.</p>
<p>  If Hudson didn't have two "elite infantry regiments" in his hands, the group of allies in the hall alone would not be able to compete with the northern nobles in the county.</p>
<p>  Dare to have such a good time, the biggest reason is naturally the tacit understanding reached with Baron Sith. Anyway, it's all a war of words, whoever coaxes who is the grandson.</p>
<p>   Even if something is wrong, Hudson doesn't think Baron Sith dares to take risks. Who made him an illegitimate child?</p>
<p>  In case of a wrong judgment, it will be a direct blow to both sides. Even if Grand Duke Kavadia loves his son and wants to increase investment, his half-brothers and sisters will work hard to hold back.</p>
<p>   Banquet, unprecedented success.</p>
<p>   All the guests who witnessed Hudson's military strength with their own eyes, the confidence that had been blown away by the group of Northern Xinjiang seemed to be regained overnight.</p>
<p>  Everyone believes that as long as everyone unites, they will have the strength to oppose the northern nobles in the county.</p>
<p>  Although with the addition of Wyton County, the local nobles are still at a disadvantage. But that doesn't matter, there is a baron from the Dalton family on the opposite side?</p>
<p>  Within the family's sphere of influence, any support from the family would be enough to turn things around.</p>
<p>  Especially the aristocrats who were forced to change their land before, they had accumulated a lot of anger and wanted to let it out immediately.</p>
<p>  Rush directly, everyone is not so impulsive, but the confidence to speak louder is still there all at once.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Master Longxi, you see that the Mountain Baron doesn't even invite me to a banquet. I really have no status as a neighbor on his side.</p>
<p>   Otherwise, you can find an entry point from other places, find a nobleman who has weight in his mind as a lobbyist, maybe the effect will be..."</p>
<p>   When things came to an end, Baron Kettley, who was unwilling to be reduced to a pawn, struggled with his last effort.</p>
<p>  Although he doesn't know what kind of big business it is, based on his understanding of this group of people, it is definitely not a serious business.</p>
<p>  Getting involved in it would definitely do him a lot of harm, but not a single benefit.</p>
<p>   In case you know something you shouldn't know, it's not impossible to be silenced by these guys.</p>
<p>   "That's enough boy, lead the way honestly. Say one more nonsense, and I'll break your third leg first.</p>
<p>  It's a good thing you have the face to say it. We have been neighbors for less than half a year, and we have done business with each other several times, but I can't even get a banquet invitation, I feel ashamed for you! "</p>
<p>   Long Xi reprimanded indifferently.</p>
<p>  At first I thought it was an important chess piece, but I didn't expect to find out that it was actually a useless chess piece.</p>
<p>  It looked like a "car", and after picking it up for a closer look, it turned out that it was a "pawn" faked.</p>
<p>  Under the murderous eyes of everyone, Kelette bit his head and led a group of people into the mountain area. All the bitterness and tears in my heart can only be swallowed in my stomach alone.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  In the living room, the atmosphere was suddenly suppressed to the extreme, as if the sky was about to fall.</p>
<p>  The visitor is a customer. I thought that Kelette brought a group of people over to discuss the delivery of the goods, but Hudson entertained them very warmly.</p>
<p>  But after a brief contact, he soon discovered that this was not the case.</p>
<p>  Especially Baron Kelette, who seemed to be serving his ancestors at the moment, followed a man in purple carefully, which made him realize that something was wrong.</p>
<p>   "Dear guests, you are not like me from the southeast. I don't know what you are here for?"</p>
<p>   Hudson asked pretending to be surprised.</p>
<p>  As for Baron Kelette, he was directly ignored by Hudson from his wonderful performance at the door.</p>
<p>  Intuition told him that what he brought this time was not business, but trouble.</p>
<p>   It's just that everyone "has no grievances in the past, and no grievances in the near future", and Hudson can't figure out what troubles will come to him at this time.</p>
<p>  Even if the Koslow family had been in the North, it was hundreds of years ago. No matter how much hatred can be drawn, it won't be a hundred years before someone sends someone to retaliate.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, you're being polite, so many of us came here today to bother you, mainly because we want to negotiate a big deal with you.</p>
<p>  A big deal of more than 300,000 gold coins, as long as this order is completed, all the economic difficulties you are facing now will be solved. "</p>
<p>  Hearing what the man in purple said, Hudson's face instantly became ugly. The news that he was heavily in debt spread from the southeast province to the north.</p>
<p>   Without thinking about it, he knew that someone had leaked the secret, and gave Baron Kelette a hard look.</p>
<p>  Among the dozen or so people present, he was the only one who knew the news, and he happened to know the news that the mountain leader was heavily in debt, so he was the number one suspect.</p>
<p>   "Three hundred thousand gold coins is indeed a big deal. It's just that such a good deal, why can it be cheaper for me?</p>
<p>  The only things that the mountain leaders can afford are ironware.</p>
<p>  Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, whether it is iron production capacity or iron quality, they are not ranked high. "</p>
<p>   Hudson said blankly.</p>
<p>  He really likes big business, but it's all serious business. Although he also took over such transactions with unknown origins, they were all small orders.</p>
<p>  Even if there are some problems, the overall risk is still controllable. The situation is obviously different this time. The large order of 300,000 gold coins is estimated to cause a big commotion as soon as the order is delivered.</p>
<p>   There are quite a few people staring at the Mountain Territory. Hudson doesn't think he can complete this huge deal without knowing it, under the eyes of a group of interested people.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, don't get too excited. It's normal for you to worry about risks when you encounter such a big business.</p>
<p>  The reason for finding you is very simple, we need to order a large number of weapons. Looking at the entire Alpha Kingdom, the weapons produced in the mountainous region are of the worst quality! "</p>
<p>  After hearing this explanation, Hudson almost spat out a mouthful of old blood.</p>
<p>   When you meet, you will reveal your shortcomings. Can you still communicate happily?</p>
<p>  Is it because he doesn't want to sell good weapons?</p>
<p>   I just dare not!</p>
<p>  Obviously better quality iron can be produced, but for the sake of safety, Master Hudson still chooses to earn a little less.</p>
<p>  If it weren't for his selfless dedication, it would be a dream for all the serf soldiers in the southeastern province to use iron weapons.</p>
<p>   Without weapons, how can you realize your dreams of gold and iron horses?</p>
<p>   It is important to know that serf soldiers were excluded from the previous fighting with weapons. Even if there is participation, it can only be regarded as a gang fight at best.</p>
<p>   Ask for tickets at the end of the month! !</p>
