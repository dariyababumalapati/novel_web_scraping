<p>  The dispute between Baron Hudson and Baron Sith has cooled down, and the new Baron Cayo can't stand it. The chaotic two counties suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>  The noisy days have passed for a long time, and the sudden silence will always make people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>  The nobles in the two counties of Wyton and Wright have such a mentality at the moment. Fearing that this is the last peace before the storm, everyone lives in fear.</p>
<p>  Some aristocratic lords who are weak and unable to withstand the toss have already started their activities, asking around to find out what happened.</p>
<p>   As one of the influential figures, Master Hudson naturally has no shortage of guests here. Just want to ask about the development of the situation, it is obviously the wrong person.</p>
<p>  Originally, Hudson was well prepared to meet the chaos. While actively expanding his armaments, he was easing relations with his opponents, and he did not forget to connect and pull people around.</p>
<p>   The preparations were well done, but the situation suddenly changed. The new Baron Cayo didn't know what was going on, and he just stood still while letting everyone fool him.</p>
<p>   Without this leader, the nobles who originally wanted revenge were naturally disappointed.</p>
<p>  People speak lightly, no matter how disappointed they are, as losers, they don't have the capital to make a fuss.</p>
<p>  The tiger skin of the Dalton family can't be involved, and more local nobles can't be dragged into the water. Only their own strength and a group of northern Xinjiang nobles will only repeat the fiasco of last year.</p>
<p>   Losing once is bad enough, another toss, no one can stand it. As a last resort, he could only forcefully suppress the anger in his heart.</p>
<p>  As a bystander, Hudson can only roughly infer the purpose of Baron Cayo in doing this. It is nothing more than kingdom politics, and it is inconvenient for the Dalton family to drive out the northern nobles.</p>
<p>  The local nobles want to do it, and they are very supportive, but they can't participate in it in person.</p>
<p>  It involves family interests and it is inconvenient to make a move, so we can only keep silent for now. After all, the play of small fights can't do anything to the nobles of northern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>   These things, you just need to know. If it is revealed, it is making the Dalton family unhappy.</p>
<p>  In the back garden of my own home, a tentacle was stretched out by others. It was obvious that I was temporarily at a disadvantage in the high-level political struggle.</p>
<p>  If this kind of bad news spreads, it will not only be embarrassing for the Dalton family, but it will also reduce their power over the southeastern province.</p>
<p>  The guys in Northern Xinjiang didn't publicize it to the outside world. It's not that they don't know. It's more likely that they are worried that the Dalton family will be caught off guard and will be hit by a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>  Guys with backgrounds should restrain themselves. Hudson, who has no political backing, should be even more cautious.</p>
<p>   Seeing everyone's anxious faces, Hudson was also helpless.</p>
<p>  If the relationship is good, give a reassuring look; if the relationship is average, send a few words of comfort at will, and then send them away.</p>
<p>  There is only so much you can do, whether you can understand the deep meaning depends on your ability. If the political mind is not bright enough, it can only be feared as it should be.</p>
<p>   "My lord, Baron Cayo-Dalton is visiting! He is in the living room at the moment, so hurry up and receive him!"</p>
<p>  Seeing the excited expression on the old butler's face, Hudson was speechless. Everyone's a baron, it's necessary to make it so...</p>
<p>  Although I complained in my heart, I walked out physically and honestly. A baron is nothing, and Lord Hudson is also one of the most important figures among the barons in the southeastern province.</p>
<p>  But when the baronet has "Dalton" in his surname, it becomes different. At least in the entire southeastern province, everyone has to save some face.</p>
<p>  In any case, people have taken the initiative to visit, and they must give enough face. Otherwise, if it gets out, it will be said that Hudson does not understand etiquette.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Looking at the person holding the magic wand, Hudson felt a bit like "Li Gui met Li Kui", and his intuition told him that something was wrong.</p>
<p>   "I've heard about Baron Cayo's name for a long time, and I'm sure he's very handsome when I saw him today. I was busy with the affairs of the territory a few days ago, so I didn't get to visit..."</p>
<p>   Speaking of excuses that he didn't even believe, Hudson felt hypocritical, but the enthusiasm on his face did not diminish in the slightest.</p>
<p>  Other nobles, they went to visit Baron Cayo, it was to hug their thighs and flatter them. With a view to building a good relationship, you can get care in the days to come.</p>
<p>  These hidden benefits are neither rare nor used by Hudson, so naturally there is no need to make yourself unhappy.</p>
<p>  Where there are people, there is a circle, and now Hudson is also the leader of a small circle. When doing things, you must also consider the impact.</p>
<p>   At this juncture, going to visit Baron Cayo may be interpreted politically as bowing your head.</p>
<p>   There is no doubt that this kind of thing must not be done. As the most famous existence among the local nobles, Hudson also has another duty-to check and balance Baron Cayo.</p>
<p>   This is not a question of willingness or not, but a group of local nobles want this kind of check and balance relationship to exist, and it is also what other noble factions in the province want to see.</p>
<p>  It seems that there is no benefit on the surface, but there is definitely a lot of support that can be obtained secretly. At the very least, when something happens, someone can stand up and help speak out.</p>
<p>  If the task is completed well, then at a suitable time point, someone will throw an olive branch, and there is a high probability that Hudson will join a certain noble faction.</p>
<p>  Although the power of these aristocratic factions is slightly weaker, they can play a role in checking and balancing Dalton in the southeastern province. There must be someone in the central government.</p>
<p>  " Baron Hudson is polite. I came here this time mainly to exchange magic. The great magician Camboy once said: Communication makes people progress.</p>
<p>   Magic is not flourishing in the southeast province. Wright and Wyton counties, and there are only two magicians, you and me, so we will have to get close in the future.</p>
<p>  …”</p>
<p>  After listening to Baron Cayo's words, Hudson could only complain secretly. What should come will come after all, but I didn't expect it to come so soon.</p>
<p>   Originally, Hudson thought he was knowledgeable (after reading the books in his own collection), even if his professional knowledge was limited, he could fool around by rambling.</p>
<p>  In terms of theoretical knowledge, there is a little flaw, and it can be pushed to the lack of systematic study.</p>
<p>   At least the last time I communicated with Miss Melissa, I was fooled and learned a lot of basic common sense about magicians.</p>
<p>   I didn't expect the slap in the face to come so quickly. "Camboy" - the greatest alchemist in the history of mankind, is known to all the nobles in the whole continent, and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>  But his own history book only emphasizes his contribution to alchemy, and doesn't mention magic at all. Never thought that this guy is actually a great magician.</p>
<p>  The sorrow of the little nobles, the ancestors accidentally recorded it, and what was left was a common-sense error.</p>
<p>   "Baron Cayo is being polite. Compared with your orthodox mages, mages like me who rely on luck are far behind in all aspects of knowledge reserves.</p>
<p>  Being able to exchange magic knowledge with you is a good learning opportunity for me, please don't hold it against me. "</p>
<p>   If you don't understand, you don't understand. Hudson keeps his posture very low. Although bears can be used to cheat, the magic concept of the Earth Bears does not mean that it is also applicable to humans.</p>
<p>   At least after staying together for so long, he didn't find that the cub had used a spell. When fighting, it is usually a slap in the face.</p>
<p>  Magic attacks have always appeared without God's knowledge or Hudson's awareness.</p>
<p>  If this is placed on the human race, if there is no spell, it would be a dream to cast magic so smoothly.</p>
<p>  Perhaps a high-level magician can do it by casting low-level magic. But if you want to be like a cub, you can output all the magic you know at will, so let's go to sleep!</p>
<p>  The gap in talent cannot be made up by hard work. The same theory that applies to genius, in the hands of a fool, plays the harp to a beast.</p>
<p>  Discussed the knowledge of magic, Baron Cayo pointed out the country with high spirits, and Hudson occasionally put forward an opinion, and then he was sprayed bloody.</p>
<p>   It involves a battle of ideas, which has never been warm. It was only a short conversation, and Hudson knew that there was also a fierce dispute of ideas among the magicians.</p>
<p>  No one can tell who is right and who is wrong. Anyway, everyone insists that their own ideas are correct.</p>
<p>   There was no fight over ideas, mainly because there were too many factions of magic ideas.</p>
<p>  Because of different philosophies, I quarreled with this person today, and quarreled with another partner tomorrow. There are so many people who have quarreled, and I will gradually forget it.</p>
<p>  Almost every time a sanctuary mage is born, a new genre will be born, and there will never be any repetition.</p>
<p>  The magisters and grand magisters below basically have their own magic concepts, and no one can convince anyone else.</p>
<p>  Even if they are masters and apprentices, when it comes to the concept of magic, they still disagree.</p>
<p> Different road non-phase plan. After each parting ways, a new magic concept was born.</p>
<p>  Anyway, before the magicians form their own ideas, they all listen to their teachers. Once they have their own ideas, then there is nothing to say—stand on their own.</p>
<p>  No one thinks it's wrong. Since the birth of magic, everyone has been having so much fun!</p>
<p>  If it weren't for the fact that the interior was too scattered to carry out effective integration, it wouldn't have been suppressed so badly by the Holy See hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>   It is also because of the dispersion that magicians have received support from all countries in the mainland. How could the ruler not like a high-level thug who did not threaten his own core interests?</p>
<p>  The conversation lasted all morning, and even the lunch was brought by the servants, and was eliminated during the discussion.</p>
<p>   "Baron Cayo, we have discussed it for so long, but it is all theoretical. To judge whether it is correct or not, it still depends on the effect of the spell.</p>
<p>   Otherwise, let's change places and cast magic according to our own ideas, and see what the specific effect is? "</p>
<p>   Hudson pretended to be calm and suggested.</p>
<p>   It's great to be able to learn magic knowledge, but it's boring to be sprayed all the time.</p>
<p>   Even if it is an in-depth discussion, it has to be conducted with the beautiful mage lady! The same mage, what is there to talk about?</p>
<p>   "I heard that there is a swamp in Baron Hudson's territory. I just learned a reinforcement technique recently. How about trying the effect?"</p>
<p>  After hearing Baron Cayo's words, Hudson scolded himself for being stupid for actually believing that the other party came to discuss magic.</p>
<p>  But now he can't refuse, and the refusal to conceal it will only arouse deeper suspicions in the Dalton family.</p>
<p> "no problem!"</p>
<p>   Hudson replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>  If you can't cover it up, then simply show it to the other party openly. Anyway, the progress of the development of the swamp is hard to describe.</p>
<p>  The open channel drainage that was first adopted failed within a month. The surrounding terrain is higher than the swamp, and after the dug ponds are filled with water, they can only give up.</p>
<p>  The result is not in vain, at least the pool water can raise fish. If there is a drought, there will be a few more water reserves.</p>
<p>  The progress of the bamboo and wood fence is not very smooth. The silt in the swamp is too deep. After excavating to a certain depth, landslides will occur on both sides, and great efforts must be made to support it.</p>
<p>   Just took Baron Cayo to see the difficulty of swamp development and dispel the doubts of the Dalton family.</p>
<p>   "Master, something is wrong! Lizards appeared in the swamp, and several slaves were accidentally dragged into the mud by them."</p>
<p>  Receiving the bad news from the housekeeper, Hudson was not only not annoyed, but secretly happy. It's too late to explode.</p>
<p>   Traces of lizard beasts have been discovered long ago. It's just that the land reclamation team is only active in the edge of the swamp, and has never encountered it.</p>
<p>  If they hadn't prepared in advance, they wouldn't just sacrifice a few orc slaves.</p>
<p>   "Calm down the slave, I'll be there right away."</p>
<p>   After finishing speaking, Hudson glanced at Baron Cayo, and gave up the choice of whether to continue.</p>
<p>   "Let's go and have a look together! Lizard beasts are also a relatively rare magic material. If you can meet the Lizard King who became a monster, then this trip will be worthwhile."</p>
<p>   Obviously, the casualties of the slaves were directly ignored by Baron Cayo. The focus of his attention is only on whether he can harvest some magic materials.</p>
<p>  With a bow and arrow on his back, a magic wand, and a knight sword at his waist, the weird combination of equipment, anyone can't help complaining about it.</p>
<p>   But Hudson doesn't care. If it wasn't for the consideration that the lizard monster lives in the swamp and there is no room for a knight gun, a knight gun should be added.</p>
<p>   Anyone who has been on the battlefield knows that in the face of safety, demeanor is not worth mentioning at all.</p>
<p>  If it's just an ordinary lizard monster, it's okay, if a few monsters appear, don't prepare more equipment, and then do it, wouldn't it be a big loss?</p>
<p>  I originally thought that there was an extra crispy mage by my side, so I needed to slow down. Unexpectedly, the gentle and gentle Baron Cayo was actually a knight.</p>
<p>  Facts once again proved that folk rumors are not credible. A pure mage's body is indeed relatively fragile, but no one stipulates that a mage cannot become a knight.</p>
<p>   Cavaliers like Hudson can be transferred to a mage sub-class, and magicians can also be a knight sub-class. As long as the family has the resources, none of this is a problem.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Looking at the messy scene, Hudson was so angry that he untied his bow and arrow and greeted the playing lizards.</p>
<p>   "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>
<p>  Arrows shot out of the air, and the outcropping lizard beasts had an arrow mark on their foreheads. If you observe carefully, these arrows all pierced the throat from the skull.</p>
<p>   "Aw, ow..."</p>
<p>   There was a scream, and the lizard beast with tenacious vitality continued to struggle. The lizard beast companion who was awakened by the scream rolled over the mud and came towards Hudson, as if to avenge his companion.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, be careful! These lizards are the most vengeful. Once they are stained, they will never die."</p>
<p>   Originally reminded, Hudson was quite grateful. It's just that at some point, this guy has distanced himself from him, as if he was avoiding the plague god.</p>
<p>  It’s just a group of beasts, how fierce can it be, as for being so timid? Even if you want to dodge people, you have to wait for the monsters to appear.</p>
<p>   Tucao return to Tucao, Hudson still performed a unique trick - release the bear!</p>
<p>  Swamp is also land, as long as it is on the ground, it is the home ground of the Earth Bear.</p>
<p>  Woke up from sleep, the cub rubbed his two big eyes with his paw, glared at Hudson dissatisfied, and then transformed into a three-meter-high giant bear.</p>
<p>   It rushed directly into the swamp, facing the charging lizards one by one, without any pause, as if they were dancing.</p>
<p>  If it wasn't for the crackling sound of broken bones coming from the swamp, I'm afraid they wouldn't have known it was a battle.</p>
<p>  The scene in front of him not only shocked Baron Cayo who was about to cast a spell, but even Hudson was shocked.</p>
<p>  Although it is easy to know that the cub is bullying the lizard, which is not even a monster, it is too easy in front of it. After all, it was a huge beast weighing hundreds of pounds, and it didn't even have room to struggle.</p>
<p>  A huge figure appeared faintly in the distance, like a lizard beast king. It's just that this guy just turned around and ran away as soon as he showed up, without any thought of revenge for the lizard boys.</p>
<p>  Bear Stearns, who played the head-stomping game, seemed to be addicted, and continued to kick the lizard beast one by one, without any thought of chasing it.</p>
<p>  Baron Kayo on the side is eager to try, but looking at the endless swamp in front of him, he really dare not take a step.</p>
<p>  Earth Bear can gallop in the swamp because of talent. Humans don't have racial talent, and the result of rashly rushing in is the question of how long they can struggle.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, it's a pity to let the Beastmaster go like this! Now let the Earth Bear chase it, there should be time."</p>
<p>  After listening to Baron Kayo's encouragement, Hudson pretended to be calm and replied: "It's useless, this lizard beast king is too vigilant. When he found something wrong, he immediately ran away without pausing at all.</p>
<p>  The swamp is its home field, and the speed is far beyond our imagination. Missed the best time, and now it is difficult to catch up.</p>
<p>   Wait for next time!</p>
<p>  As long as you live in this swamp, you will meet again sooner or later. If this beast is caught, I will send someone to notify you as soon as possible. "</p>
<p>   If he can capture a lizard beast king, Hudson is also very happy. Buyers are all ready-made, and as far as the importance of Baron Cayo is concerned, there is no need to worry about not being able to sell for a good price.</p>
<p>  But the problem is that Uncle Xiong, who is addicted to playing, loves to play, and the bear's head turns, which is not bad at all.</p>
<p>   Selling the Lizard Beastmaster in front of it, and Hudson wants to make a difference from it, that is simply insulting the bear's IQ.</p>
<p>  Although everyone is hundreds of meters apart now, this distance does not affect Uncle Xiong's eavesdropping in the slightest.</p>
<p>  Whether to make the price difference is just a small problem, and Master Hudson is not a person who is short of three melons and two dates. But a bear in debt and a bear without debt are two completely different states.</p>
<p>  Now Bear Stearns, although he has been avoiding the debt problem, can eat people with a short mouth after all. In the face of Hudson's orders, complaining is nothing but complaints, but it is still done well.</p>
<p>  Once this guy turns over, if you want Uncle Xiong to do something again, it depends on your mood. After all, this is an extremely lazy bear.</p>
<p>  Can sit, never stand; can lie down, never sit. There are only two daily hobbies: eating and sleeping.</p>
<p>   Only when you have eaten enough and slept enough, will you come out for activities. This time is usually no more than two hours.</p>
<p>   work?</p>
<p>   It was too embarrassing for the lazy Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>  If it weren't for the huge debts and worrying that the **** shovel officer would cut off its support, Uncle Xiong wouldn't be as easy to talk to as he is now.</p>
