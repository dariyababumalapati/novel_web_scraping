<p>  Walking on the street, all kinds of goods are piled up on the counters. The cries of merchants can be heard endlessly.</p>
<p>  The prosperous Dadir city in the past seems to be back.</p>
<p>   It can be seen that Baron Sith has done his homework. Among other things, it takes a lot of effort for a merchant like Guanghui.</p>
<p>  Like all the local nobles, Hudson only sees but does not buy. This is what everyone agreed in advance, no matter what products appear in the city, they will not be traded this time.</p>
<p>   As for the future, let’s talk about it in due course. The memory of nobles also has a time limit. Although emotionally speaking, everyone does not want to see the nobles in the northern border grow bigger, but the southern region really needs a business center.</p>
<p>  Several Dardir cities become business centers, which can bring enough benefits to everyone, and it is estimated that everyone will not refuse this convenience.</p>
<p>  If the funders don’t make a move, the transaction volume will naturally not increase. The contributions of just a few dozen northern nobles are far from enough to support a commercial center.</p>
<p>   Without any surprise, none of Baron Kettley's orc slaves were sold. Not only did the local nobles not buy it, but all the northern nobles did not take care of the business either.</p>
<p>  Although Baron Sith greeted everyone, it is a pity that all the nobles of the North have a large number of orc slaves. If they didn't know that they couldn't make a move, they might have to sell some of them to cash out.</p>
<p>   There is no way, orc slaves are really hard to use. Apart from some simple menial work, nothing else can be done.</p>
<p>  The most important thing is the language barrier, and it is difficult to carry out the training smoothly.</p>
<p>   Not every territory has endless hard work. When the number of slaves exceeds the demand, the lords will naturally not continue to buy slaves.</p>
<p>  Even though everyone sympathizes with Baron Kettley's experience, it's only in words. It's a bit close to wanting them to support with real money.</p>
<p>   Besides, it’s not that everyone didn’t help. A group of nobles from northern Xinjiang also collected a few thousand gold coins and lent them to Baron Kettley for emergency.</p>
<p>  As entrepreneurs, the money is squeezed out from between the teeth. Being able to do this is already quite interesting.</p>
<p>   After all, although everyone is a nobleman in the northern border, the land of the northern border is also extremely vast, and most of them have never socialized before.</p>
<p>  If it weren't for a chance, let them go south together in a group, it is estimated that they would not even have the current relationship.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   "Baron Kettley, it seems that these slaves are no longer wanted. There is no point in keeping them except for wasting food. Find a chance to dispose of them!"</p>
<p>  Sith suggested sincerely.</p>
<p>   Although the reputation of slaughtering slaves is not good, you can always find a way to cover it up. If you keep supporting this group of idlers, your reputation will not be damaged, but your wallet can't stand it!</p>
<p>  Just helping to raise him for two days, Baron Sith felt the pressure. If Baron Kettley stayed here for a long time, he couldn't stand it.</p>
<p>   "Dear Baron Sith, this is really cruel. Otherwise, wait and see, no one wants these slaves now, because it is now the slack season.</p>
<p>   After staying for two months, spring plowing begins, and lords who need labor may buy it.</p>
<p>  You can rest assured that the daily expenses of the slaves will be taken as my loan from you. As long as these slaves are sold, I will return them as soon as possible. Baron Kettley said sincerely.</p>
<p>  Those who didn’t know thought that he valued the life and death of the slaves in front of him, but he was actually just fighting for interests. Anyway, the slave is now being raised by Baron Sith, and his pressure has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>   If you can wait until the spring plowing and sell these slaves, you will make a lot of money.</p>
<p>   But this is only a possibility. No one can guarantee whether the local nobles will be short of labor during the spring plowing season.</p>
<p>   At least during autumn plowing, people rely on the help of relatives and friends to complete the sowing.</p>
<p>   During spring plowing, it is not impossible to borrow again. Most nobles will sell this kind of favor that has no risk and does not require much price.</p>
<p>  If these slaves still cannot be sold until the spring plowing, then not only Baron Kettley will be finished, but even Baron Sith will go crazy.</p>
<p>  Poor ghosts are unable to pay back the money. More than 20,000 slaves eat, drink and scatter every day, which is not a small expense.</p>
<p>  Even if calculated according to the daily expenditure of three copper coins per person, 25,000 people would have to spend 75,000 copper coins a day, which is equivalent to 50 gold coins.</p>
<p>   After two months, at least three thousand gold coins will be in vain. This is just the most basic expenses, the military expenses of guarding the slaves, has it not been included?</p>
<p>  In case of an accident, a slave riot or something, I don’t know how much loss will be incurred.</p>
<p>   What's more troublesome is that all the money has been taken out, and the big trouble of orc slaves still hasn't been solved.</p>
<p>   It is impossible to return the goods. Slave traders these days do not have the option to return the goods.</p>
<p>  Maybe the unlucky Baron Kettley will be chased by creditors all over the world in the future, but Baron Sith, who took over the slave Ray, will inevitably suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>  "impossible!"</p>
<p>   "Baron Kettley, if you insist on keeping these slaves, then take them home and raise them yourself!</p>
<p>  Slave traders are not welcome in Dadir City, I will immediately make a set of laws to prohibit slave trading here. "</p>
<p>  Sith said indifferently.</p>
<p>  As a lord, he has the right to make laws in his own territory.</p>
<p>  If the creditors are not too big, Baron Kettley can also make his own laws to keep all the creditors out.</p>
<p>   "Dear Baron Sith, I don't want to do this either. But there is no way. If I deal with these slaves now, all my investment will be lost.</p>
<p>  According to the agreement, my debt period is only half a year. If you can't repay the debt owed within half a year, you can imagine the consequences.</p>
<p>  If you can come forward and get the creditors to agree to postpone the debt collection, I will immediately follow your will!</p>
<p>  If you can’t do it, then you have no choice but to let you go first. You can do whatever you want, anyway, I won't take them away. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley said in a broken can.</p>
<p>   Even if he offends Baron Sith to death, it is better than being hunted down by creditors. Among the two counties of Wright and Wyton, Baron Sith has the strongest family background.</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley couldn't find a better way than relying on him.</p>
<p>   "It's impossible! You have too many debts, and I don't have that face. If you have the time, you might as well beg your father.</p>
<p>  If Viscount Hank Cage is willing to come forward, maybe everyone will give you another chance.</p>
<p>  Maple Leaf Territory is fertile. As long as you work hard, you can still pay off your debts within five years. "</p>
<p>  The more he said, the lower his voice, obviously Baron Sith didn't believe this nonsense himself. No matter how fertile the land in the Maple Leaf Territory, the territory still has expenses!</p>
<p>  Calculating income alone without considering the wealth accumulation model of expenditure is pure hooliganism.</p>
<p>   There are many territories that earn tens of thousands of gold coins, or even tens of thousands of gold coins a year, but there are very few territories that can still have a balance of tens of thousands of gold coins after spending.</p>
<p>  Not to mention the Maple Leaf leader, even if Dardir City is managed, Baron Sith can't guarantee that he can have a balance of tens of thousands of gold coins every year.</p>
<p>   If the territorial income is simply calculated, the five giants in northern Xinjiang each occupy more than one province, and their annual income is worth millions of gold coins.</p>
<p>   It can be maintained because the great nobles have other industries.</p>
<p>  Including the Sith Baron who wants to build Dadir City into a commercial center in the south. On the surface, it is for tax purposes, but in fact it is to gather popularity and develop its own industry.</p>
<p>   Relying solely on that little tax, I am afraid that it is not enough for daily expenses.</p>
<p>   What really makes money is renting/selling shops and houses in the city, as well as selling food, vegetables, meat and some daily necessities produced in the territory.</p>
<p>   Similar gameplay, Maple Leaf collar can't copy. It's just enough to earn income from farming, and it's okay to live a small life with peace of mind. It's impossible to get rich all at once.</p>
<p>  Maybe because he thought the idea was too bad, after a pause, Baron Sith added again: "Maybe you can go talk to that mountain baron.</p>
<p>   If one of the two counties has the greatest demand for labor, that guy is the one.</p>
<p>  With that guy's appetite, even if the population of the territory exceeds 20,000, it still cannot meet his needs.</p>
<p>   Anyway, you have dealt with him before, so just sell the slave to him at a discount. As long as the price is cheap enough, he will not dislike it.</p>
<p>   At worst, it’s better to lose some money than to keep procrastinating. You must know that every day of delay like this now will increase your loss by nearly a hundred gold coins. "</p>
<p>  This is the truth, although Sith does not want to befriend the enemy. But compared to smashing a hot potato into one's own hands, it's better to let the enemy off the hook.</p>
<p>  After this period of contact, he found that Hudson's strengths lie in military and territorial development, but he really doesn't see how strong his political skills are.</p>
<p>   At the very least, he will not give compliments to his competitors if he is translocated.</p>
<p>  Since political means cannot keep up, the degree of danger is also reduced. There is nothing wrong with developing the territory, but it would be a big failure if you focus on the development of the territory.</p>
<p>   "It's useless, that guy is also heavily in debt now. For the development of the territory, that idiot invested all his money in it.</p>
<p>  Now the situation is stable, the junk produced by that guy can no longer be sold, only some farm tools and daily necessities can be sold.</p>
<p>  If it weren't for the fact that the iron products produced can be used to pay off debts, his situation is not much better than mine.</p>
<p>  I invested more than 60,000 gold coins in these slaves. Even if they sell at a loss, do you think that **** is capable of buying them? "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley said pretending to be helpless.</p>
<p>   In front of Baron Sith, he can't say anything good about Hudson. What's more, he didn't have a good impression of Hudson in the first place, and what he said now was from his heart.</p>
<p>   Got an unexpected answer, and the Sith Baron was mixed. It is undoubtedly a good thing that competitors have financial problems, but the tragedy is that the troubles seem to be irreversible.</p>
<p>   "Kately, what do you want?</p>
<p>   If it's a stupid thing to ask me to settle your debts for you, then it goes without saying.</p>
<p>   Everyone is a smart person, you should know how big the basket you poke out.</p>
<p>  The investment of more than 60,000 gold coins collected a pile of garbage. Even if some of the high-quality slaves can be sold, the loss this time will not be less than 50,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>  No one can bear such a huge financial loss for you. Even if the plan fails because of this, it is impossible for me to agree.</p>
<p>   For your sake, I have done my best. All the colleagues in Northern Xinjiang have a large backlog of slaves in their hands, and it is impossible to take your order. "</p>
<p>   Baron Sith said indifferently.</p>
<p>  If it wasn't for the wrong occasion, he would have liked to immediately kill this annoying guy in front of him. Compared with this guy, he suddenly felt that the "Hudson" who was hostile to him was as cute as a little white rabbit.</p>
<p>   "Among the more than 60,000 gold coins, there are more than 50,000 in arrears, and these must be resolved.</p>
<p>   Among these slaves, the high-quality slaves who can be sold can probably return 10,000 gold coins, and there is still a huge funding gap of 40,000.</p>
<p>  I can probably borrow 10,000 gold coins from relatives, friends, and family members in the Northland, and the family can also lend 10,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>  A group of colleagues also lent me several thousand gold coins. The weapons and equipment and war horses in my hands can also be cashed in thousands of gold coins. Now I only need 10,000 gold coins to tide over this difficulty.</p>
<p>  So I hope that your Excellency will be generous and lend me 10,000 gold coins to help me tide over this difficulty. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettler said earnestly.</p>
<p>  The number of holes dropped from 50,000 to 10,000, and Baron Sith's complexion improved a lot. Just whether to lend the money, he was still beating drums in his heart.</p>
<p>  Intuition told him that things would definitely not be that simple. If Baron Kettley asked to borrow money in normal times, there was a high probability that he could borrow money from relatives and friends.</p>
<p>   But it's different now, everyone knows that he lost a lot of money. Before borrowing money, one has to consider his ability to repay.</p>
<p>  What if you know you can’t fill in the hole and run away with the money?</p>
<p>  Similar things have never happened in the continent of Aslante. Everyone can only admit that they are unlucky when they encounter it, and they can only think about the cross-border recovery of arrears.</p>
<p>   "If I don't agree, don't you want to lead someone to **** the caravan?"</p>
<p>   Baron Sith asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>   Going out to rob without money is perfectly normal for the nobles of the Northland. At other times, Baron Sith would not mind his own business.</p>
<p>   It’s just not right now, before the word of mouth of Dadir City has been erected, the big news of merchants being robbed came out, and the story behind it couldn’t go on.</p>
<p>   "If we really want to get to that point, I have nothing to do."</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley spread his hands and directly admitted that he had that plan.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Holding the extorted gold coins, Kettley knew that he had offended the Baron Sith to death, and it might be difficult for everyone to maintain their apparent friendship in the future.</p>
<p>   "Prepare the car, we are going to visit Baron Hudson."</p>
<p>   "Kately, I'm afraid it's not good to go now?"</p>
<p>   Knight Holman said worriedly.</p>
<p>  It's really immoral to visit his opponent just after receiving money from Baron Sith, and it's still on his territory.</p>
<p>   "If you don't look for him, what will I do with the slaves in my hands? Is it really necessary to deal with them, and then bear a cruel name?</p>
<p>   Baron Sith can lend me 10,000 gold coins, which is already very interesting, and I can't push him into a hurry.</p>
<p>   But even with the 10,000 gold coins, what should I use to fill the remaining big hole?</p>
<p>  Uncle Holman, don't you think that at this time, someone is really willing to lend me money?</p>
<p>  Even within the family, if they knew the news, they would probably complain.</p>
<p>  Instead of embarrassing everyone, it is better not to say this at all, so as not to hurt feelings. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettler said in a self-deprecating manner.</p>
<p>   If you don’t ask to borrow money, you will never know how popular you are. The aristocrats who had a good relationship with each other this time took out two or three hundred gold coins to deal with it.</p>
<p>  In the future, everyone will still support each other, but now they are only willing to lend such a small amount of money. Then it is even more difficult to let relatives and friends who are far away in the north and have difficulty in socializing in the future pay for it.</p>
<p>   After all, what the nobles pay attention to is mutual benefit and reciprocity. You can't let others pay unilaterally and see nothing in return!</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley, who had seen through all this, did not complain, but chose to respond positively.</p>
<p>  At least in the last conversation, he was sure that Hudson was interested in these orc slaves. Although this buyer may not necessarily be rich, he is still a buyer after all.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   After going around in a circle and cheating Baron Sith, the two appeared on the negotiating table again.</p>
<p>  Hudson hasn't changed much, but Baron Kettley's mentality has changed. The cruel reality told him that the personal connections he had previously managed were not reliable.</p>
<p>   In the last negotiation, he still had some confidence. I thought that the worst outcome would be nothing more than a loss, and with the help of relatives and friends, at worst, the territory could be kept.</p>
<p>  The reality is very embarrassing. If it weren't for the strict fiefdom system of the kingdom, there might still be people wishing him to go bankrupt so that he could come and take over the fief.</p>
<p>   "Baron Kettley, I'm telling you the truth. I'm indeed interested in these slaves, but the mountain leader is currently short of financial resources, and the cash he can use is at most 20,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>  If the transaction is made at this price, you may suffer a lot this time. Taking advantage of the fire like this is not in line with chivalry, so I didn't make an offer last time. "</p>
<p>  After hearing Hudson's words, Baron Kettley secretly complained.</p>
<p>  A profiteer talks about "chivalry", which is very funny, but now he can't laugh at all.</p>
<p>  The only buyer has insufficient financial resources, and keeps saying that he will not take advantage of the fire to rob, so he should take the initiative to send it up for others to rob!</p>
<p>  Typically standing upright at the same time, unwilling to bear moral pressure. Later, it was spread that it was not Master Hudson who took advantage of the fire to rob, but Master Hudson who helped the poor.</p>
<p>  As for him, Baron Kettley, he is naturally a gold medal supporting actor who is too stupid to be saved. Who made him now have the title of "the stupidest slave trader"?</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, 30,000 gold coins! As long as 30,000 gold coins, these slaves will be packaged and sold to you.</p>
<p>   Now that the matter has come to this point, I will no longer hide it. In order to buy these slaves, I paid 60,000 gold coins for the cost alone.</p>
<p>  Now it’s on sale at 50% off, and I have to rely on debt to settle the final payment. If the price is lowered again, I can only go bankrupt in place. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley said helplessly.</p>
<p>   It is estimated that he should be the most failed businessman in the whole continent. Others bargaining is to earn more and earn less, but he is different, just to not go bankrupt.</p>
<p>   "Baron Kettley, don't worry. Even if I raise 30,000 gold coins to trade, I'm afraid your life will not be easy in the future.</p>
<p>  Territory development is very expensive. No matter how good the foundation of the Maple Leaf collar is, it will be difficult to achieve a balance of payments in the first two years, and it will not work if there is not enough liquidity on hand.</p>
<p>   Why don't we change the way of cooperation, I will buy these slaves at the original price. It's just that cash is not used for settlement, but iron products produced in the territory are traded.</p>
<p>   You take these iron products to talk to the gang of slave traders. They are some agricultural tools and daily necessities. There will also be a large market in the Northland, so you don’t have to worry about selling them. "</p>
<p>   Hudson encouraged.</p>
<p>  Frankly speaking, this time he really didn't intend to cheat. After all, you can't catch a sheep and keep rolling wool, or else the sheep will be bald, and there will be no need to roll it later.</p>
<p>  As a tool man, Baron Kettley overfulfilled the task this time. Not only did Baron Sith cheat, but also the northern nobles were divided.</p>
<p>  It would be a pity to throw away such a valuable chess piece.</p>
<p>   It just so happened that the family needed to expand the market, so they simply took this as an opportunity to try it out. It would be best if the market in the Northland could be opened up, and it didn't matter if they couldn't.</p>
<p>  As a high value-added product, the cost of a commodity worth 60,000 gold coins is less than 30,000 gold coins!</p>
<p>  As long as it does not sell locally or compete with itself for the market, Hudson does not mind hitting the outside market at all.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, I'm afraid this is a little difficult, right? Unlike the southeastern provinces, the iron products market in the Northland is actually monopolized, and foreign products cannot be squeezed in at all..."</p>
<p>   Before Baron Kettley could finish speaking, Hudson interrupted: "Your Excellency, I've thought too much. Can't you sell it, and you're not allowed to use it yourself?</p>
<p>  Even if you can’t use it yourself, you can still sell it to the Beastman Empire, maybe you can earn more. As long as it is not sold in the Northland, it will be able to explain the past.</p>
<p>   Besides, it was the group of slave traders who were responsible for the sales. You just hand over the product to them, and what happens later has nothing to do with you. "</p>
<p>   There is no problem, whoever sells is responsible. Even if it really offends the interests of local snakes, it is impossible for them to travel thousands of miles to the southeastern province to find a middleman to settle accounts.</p>
<p>   "However, cash has become a commodity, can they agree?"</p>
<p>  Kately’s heart is really uncertain, at least on him, it is unacceptable for cash to become a commodity.</p>
<p>   "It's up to them. Anyway, if you don't have any money now, they will either accept the goods to pay off the debt, or they will wait until you have money to collect. At most, they will beat you up and let out a bad breath.</p>
<p>  Even if they wish to kill you, for the sake of money, they still want you to live well.</p>
<p>  Even if one of them is impulsive, others will help stop it. After all, if you really have an accident, the debt will be even more difficult to collect. "</p>
<p>   Hudson said indifferently.</p>
<p>   The one who owes the debt is the uncle, and the same applies in the continent of Aslante. If creditors are irrational, it must be that you don't owe enough.</p>
<p>   There are few creditors who owe more than 50,000 gold coins like Baron Kettley can give up.</p>
