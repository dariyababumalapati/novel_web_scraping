<p>  According to the official history of the continent of Aslante, there were no orcs in ancient times. Until a guy who claimed to be a beast **** was born out of nowhere, leading the beasts to evolve into intelligent races.</p>
<p>   Then, under the inspiration of the gods, the mouse evolved into a rat man, the lion evolved into a lion man, the eagle evolved into an eagle man, and the cheetah evolved into a leopard man...</p>
<p>  The second senior brother is more powerful, and has evolved Pig and Wild Boar respectively. The former inherited his laziness, and the latter inherited his strength.</p>
<p>  As for the monsters that have not evolved, they are stubborn and unrepentant creatures, all abandoned by the gods.</p>
<p>   It's just this statement, which was strongly opposed by Bear Stearns. According to Cubs, these guys who wrote history are unscrupulous people, and they are all groundless fabrications.</p>
<p>  The appearance of orcs is completely the product of some intelligent races tossing about and **** with wild beasts. Among them, the human race contributed the most, followed by the dragon race, dwarves, giants... These races also participated, including some gods.</p>
<p>   If you insist on saying that there are no related races, it is estimated that the elves with serious cleanliness may not have participated in the creation of the race. Perhaps this is also the reason why elves and orcs have always disliked each other.</p>
<p>  The evidence is very simple: the overall quality of orcs is far behind that of Warcraft. Not only is the strength weakened, but the wisdom of most orcs is also inferior to that of Warcraft. Only the best among them can stand shoulder to shoulder with similar monsters.</p>
<p>   Wisdom and strength are both declining, so we can't just evolve claws, right? Such an evolution is not so much an evolution as a degeneration.</p>
<p>  Of course, the persuasiveness of this evidence needs to be strengthened. After all, the direction of evolution is uncontrollable, and it is not surprising that there are a bunch of failed products.</p>
<p>  The key to the problem lies in the "inspiration of the gods". If a lot of failed products are evolved under the leadership of the gods, it is really unreasonable.</p>
<p>   On the contrary, the **** theory is easier for Hudson to accept. After all, Orcs are deeply polarized, with horribly high upper and lower limits.</p>
<p>  If it has something to do with the ancestors who created them, then it makes sense. They are all hybrids, and races that have been contaminated with the blood of the gods are likely to be much stronger than those produced by ordinary intelligent races.</p>
<p>  Some powerful races in the orc empire firmly claim that they are descendants of gods. In addition to the unified belief in beast gods, there are also a bunch of racial gods, or totems.</p>
<p>  The reality template is Prince Alex of the Orc Empire. As the contemporary race, he has contributed the most to the Lord, and he has produced many wonderful descendants.</p>
<p>   Except for a few talents that are passable, the rest are weak chicken races, at least compared to pure-blooded Beamon.</p>
<p>  The sons and grandchildren added together, Alex created the descendants of the two regiments by himself. If these hybrid creatures continue to hybridize with other creatures, no one knows how many new species will be produced.</p>
<p>  A large number of new races also confirmed the feasibility of the "hybrid theory" from the side. At least a considerable part of the orc races are all mixed blood.</p>
<p>   After carefully looking at it and satisfying his curiosity, Hudson resolutely stopped his thoughts of continuing to explore the truth.</p>
<p>   Some things, it is better not to know too much. If you accidentally uncover the dust-laden secret for a long time, will life be over?</p>
<p>   "I don't know if Baron Kettley is here today, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>   Hudson asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>  For no reason, he didn't believe that his good neighbor would come here to give gifts. What's more, this group of grotesque orcs in front of them is not suitable as a gift.</p>
<p>  If it is a gift, it is also a fox girl, a rabbit girl, a cat girl, a leopard girl... These beauties from other races are more likely to gain the favor of their masters.</p>
<p>   Of course, this is just a thought. The price of alien beauties is not cheap, and they are often far more than human women in the slave market, usually starting with dozens of gold coins.</p>
<p>  Based on the friendship between the two, the generous Master Hudson is only willing to give away ten iron pots, how could Kettley give away dozens of beauties from different races?</p>
<p>   "I heard that Baron Hudson has been busy opening up wasteland recently. It just so happens that I have a batch of cheap and easy-to-use orc slaves in my hands. If you are interested, you can transfer them."</p>
<p>   Baron Kettler said straight to the point.</p>
<p>   This is not the first time the two have done business, and he is very aware of Hudson's feces. If he didn't get straight to the point, the profiteer in front of him would be able to accompany him around for a day.</p>
<p>  Based on the idea that the sooner he strikes, the sooner he will be relieved, Baron Kettley really doesn't want to keep a large group of orc slaves in the way.</p>
<p>   Looking at the group of orc slaves again, Hudson admitted that he was indeed tempted. Land reclamation is very manpower-intensive. Now the hilly area is fine, but once the tentacles are extended to the swamp area, it will be the hardest hit area.</p>
<p>  In the continent of Aslant, there are countless strange creatures and dangerous places. No one knows what dangers will lie in the mysterious swamp.</p>
<p>  Even if there were no such dangers, the price to be paid for developing the swamp would not be small. Without enough human lives to fill it, there would be no results at all.</p>
<p>  If there is no risk at all, the fertile swamp has already been occupied by people, how can Hudson get his turn?</p>
<p>   Anyway, Hudson didn't believe it, and no one found the swamp outside his own territory. Even ordinary aristocrats wouldn't run around, and it's understandable if they didn't find out, but the griffin cavalry flying in the sky wouldn't be ignorant, right?</p>
<p>   Filling it with your own serfs is very damaging to prestige. Once the casualties exceed the tolerance limit, the serfs will also make a fuss, which may cause a big scandal.</p>
<p>   In contrast, using orc slaves does not have such troubles. No matter how heavy the casualties are, the outside world will not pay attention.</p>
<p>   After a pause, Hudson asked tentatively: "Your Excellency needs to make a trip in person. I think there should be a lot of slaves here, right?"</p>
<p>  Since it is purchasing orc slaves, it is definitely meaningless if the quantity is too small, it will only increase the management cost of the territory; if the quantity is too large, Master Hudson's wallet will not be able to bear it.</p>
<p>   In a sense, Baron Kettley didn’t pick the right date for his visit this time, and chose the time when Lord Hudson was the poorest to sell.</p>
<p>   "The number is not too much. All kinds of orc slaves add up to only 20,000 to 30,000 people, and I have to keep some for myself.</p>
<p>  Now Wright and Wyton counties are seriously short of labor force, the number of slaves is nothing at all! "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettler pretended to be confident.</p>
<p>   There is nothing wrong with it, as long as the price is cheap enough, more than 20,000 slaves are definitely not enough for the nobles in the two counties. If you want to satisfy everyone's appetite, adding a zero at the end is almost the same.</p>
<p>  The only premise is that "beastman" cannot be added in front of the slave, otherwise the situation will be reversed. In particular, these orcs were divided into dozens of races, which made sales even more difficult.</p>
<p>   "In this case, congratulations to Baron Kettley for making a fortune. If the price is right, I will keep the tauren and kobold."</p>
<p>   Hudson said blankly.</p>
<p>   Whether orcs are easy to use, he doesn't know. However, he has heard some stories and legends. Kobolds are good at digging holes and can be used for mining;</p>
<p>  As for other races, Master Hudson said: either they look too rough, or they are not familiar with them.</p>
<p>  Pockets are not rich, in order to avoid pitfalls, it is better not to touch them. After all, the Baron Kettley in front of him really doesn't look like a fuel-efficient lamp.</p>
<p>   Changed to someone else, and he was tricked in the transaction, and it is estimated that he will never come to the door. It doesn't look like this guy is able to maintain his sanity all the time, as if he is not affected by the previous transaction at all.</p>
<p>   "Sorry, Baron Hudson. These slaves are not only sold, they can only be purchased in combination, and the number of purchases at a time must not be less than 10,000.</p>
<p>   If the quantity purchased is large enough, you can also get a discount. If you can buy it in a package, you can even get 30% off wholesale.</p>
<p>  The main reason is that my communication skills are too weak, and I have no friendship with most of the nobles in the two counties, so I am embarrassed to come to sell. Otherwise, I would not find you for wholesale sales. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley replied pretending to be helpless.</p>
<p>   They all learned from Hudson. High-quality slaves and low-quality slaves were mixed and sold, so as not to sell out the good ones and throw all the rest in their hands.</p>
<p>  In order to convince Hudson that he was really tearing up the sale, he even did not hesitate to expose his shortcomings and bluntly said that he had a bad relationship with the local nobles.</p>
<p>  It's a pity that the result is doomed to disappoint him. After the poor Mr. Hudson heard that it was packaged and sold, he didn't even have the courage to ask the price.</p>
<p>   Taking the risk of capturing slaves from the Orc Empire, and sending them over thousands of miles, and changing hands many times along the way, the cost can still be roughly estimated.</p>
<p>   If you don’t earn multiple times the profit, who will be a notorious slave trader if you are full? Even if it is really cheap to sell, where can it be cheap?</p>
<p>  Even if the price is only one-third of that of a human slave, Hudson, who is heavily in debt, can't afford it now.</p>
<p>   Even if secondary distribution is possible, Hudson will not advance funds to do this high-risk transaction.</p>
<p>   After all, slaves were meant to eat. In case the market conditions are not good, a large backlog of slaves will end up in their own hands, and daily consumption can overwhelm people.</p>
<p>   "Since this is the case, then we can only look forward to the next cooperation."</p>
<p>  As soon as Hudson finished speaking, Baron Kettley's expression turned ugly instantly. The only person in the two counties who could eat these slaves stopped playing. Isn't this killing him?</p>
<p>   "Your Excellency, Baron, don't refuse in such a hurry, you might as well listen to my quotation first, the price is definitely an unexpected discount. If you sell 24,000 slaves in a package, you only need to pay 55,000 gold coins..."</p>
<p>   Without waiting for Baron Kettley to finish speaking, Hudson turned his head directly. The orc slaves who can walk out from the northern border are definitely strong laborers.</p>
<p>  The average unit price is less than 2.5 gold coins, and the price is indeed unimaginably low.</p>
<p>   At the same price, if you want to buy a human slave, you will probably be beaten out by the slave trader directly.</p>
<p>   Referring to the serfs exchanged by Hudson before, we know that the quantity is less than half of this. After adding a batch of livestock and grain, the total price is almost the same.</p>
<p>   You must know that serfs are based on the family unit, but the old, women, old and young are packed together to calculate the population, and less than half of them are young and strong men and women.</p>
<p>   At such a price, everyone is still making friends, and they didn’t intentionally kill him. According to the current slave market in the market, the price can be even higher.</p>
<p>   Maybe there will be cheaper slaves in another time, but the current market price is like this. Don't think about buying slaves in the southeastern provinces where supply and demand are seriously out of balance at prices in troubled times.</p>
<p>   "With all due respect, Lord Kettley. The price you gave is indeed good, but a good price does not mean a good product.</p>
<p>  Language communication alone is a big problem. What's more, these slaves are all recently captured raw slaves, and the difficulty of management will increase greatly.</p>
<p>   Even if it is sold separately, few nobles will be interested, let alone packaged.</p>
<p>   Soon, Dadir City will hold a trade fair. Your Excellency should bring the slaves over there, and ask Baron Sith for help! "</p>
<p>  Hudson decisively gave a bad idea.</p>
<p>   I was worrying about how to bring down Baron Sith, and now the opportunity came to my door. It is the first time to hold a trade fair, what is needed is to make a name, and a large number of unsalable products will not work.</p>
<p>   But this huge orc slave is a hot potato. As for the difficulty of management, that is purely an excuse for Hudson to refuse.</p>
<p>  With the small number of soldiers led by Maple Leaf, so many slaves can be guarded. The rebellious ones inside had been dealt with long ago.</p>
<p>   As for how Baron Sith will deal with this trouble, it has nothing to do with Hudson. Anyway, no matter what the final outcome is, the seeds of contradictions can be sold within the nobles of the Northland.</p>
<p>   "Baron Hudson, to tell you the truth. The relationship between me and Baron Sith has not been very good, and the matter can be traced back to an outing.</p>
<p>   It is inconvenient to discuss the specific process. Anyway, our relationship has never been great. Not long ago, he wanted to sneak attack on your territory, but I refused. I count on him to help, I'm afraid..."</p>
<p>  Hudson couldn't judge the authenticity of Baron Kettley's misfortune. But one thing is certain, that is, Master Hudson really has no money.</p>
<p>  If it is 10,000 to 20,000 gold coins, he can still grit his teeth and take it out, but 30,000 to 40,000 gold coins have to be borrowed. No matter how much it is, it is estimated that it will be difficult to borrow money.</p>
<p>  Hudson was deeply in debt, and it was basically an open secret among native aristocratic circles. When it comes to money, even relatives and friends have to weigh his repayment ability.</p>
<p>   "Since this is the case, your Excellency should go there. Presumably, you have received the invitation letter. It clearly states that we hope that we will bring the goods to do business.</p>
<p>  Even everyone's daily expenses, our Sith Baron proudly stated that he would be responsible. More than 20,000 slaves eat, drink and scatter every day, which is not a small sum.</p>
<p>   Your Excellency only needs to bring all the slaves there, and in a short time, Baron Sith will be more worried than you. "</p>
<p>   Hudson urged hard.</p>
<p>   It's not that he deliberately made trouble, it's that Baron Sith is too arrogant. In order to win the reputation of Dardir City, they even dared to provide board and lodging for the participants.</p>
<p>   Didn’t you force Master Hudson to do bad things this time?</p>
<p>  Originally, Hudson was going to invite a group of nobles, bring more people to eat and drink for free, and make some troubles by the way, so that the governor hundreds of miles away can see his efforts.</p>
<p>   Now that there is an extra knife of Baron Kettler, it is even more necessary to support Baron Sith. Not only to cheer, but also to set the stage high.</p>
<p>   After hesitating for a while, reality finally defeated everything. Even though he knew it would be immoral to do so, Baron Kettley still gritted his teeth and nodded.</p>
<p>  In any case, offending Baron Sith alone is better than offending a group of wealthy families in the North. They are all vicious slave traders. If you don't pay their debts, you can imagine how terrible the consequences will be.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>  Dadir City, seeing the day of the event approaching day by day, Baron Sith always feels restless. His intuition told him that something bad was about to happen.</p>
<p>  But he took stock of all the preparatory work, and made corresponding arrangements for all possible omissions, and he really couldn't find any problems.</p>
<p>   "After the group of local nobles received the invitation, what is their reaction now? Will they collectively boycott this event?"</p>
<p>   All the nobles in the Northland have agreed, even if they had a petty quarrel with him on weekdays, they expressed their full support this time. Then it can only be the local nobles who do things.</p>
<p>  In fact, before planning this operation, he also carried out a lot of public relations activities, attracting a group of local neutral nobles.</p>
<p>   Compared with the entire local aristocratic group, there are only a few who are willing to accept his solicitation.</p>
<p>   "Don't worry, young master. According to the information we have collected, the local nobles have indeed joined forces, but they are not boycotting participation in this event, but to bring more people over to increase our logistical pressure.</p>
<p>   It is said that it was the mountain baron who initiated this operation behind the scenes. It is estimated that they want to take advantage of the crowd and create chaos for us.</p>
<p>   After all, he is from a small family, so he cannot avoid being petty in his actions. The event lasts only a few days, even if they have more people, how much will they add to our expenses?</p>
<p>  Where we should be prepared, we have taken precautions. Including the northern nobles who are close to the young master, we will have more than 1,500 troops to maintain order.</p>
<p>   Even if they want to make trouble, we can respond in time. As long as the commercial status of Dardir City is re-established, the current efforts can be doubled in the future. "</p>
<p>  The old butler said disdainfully.</p>
<p>   Originally thought that the opponent was at the gold level, but he didn't expect it to be bronze, which really made him lose interest.</p>
<p>  Dadir City has obvious regional geographical advantages. It is unrealistic to prevent it from becoming a commercial center. The best way to deal with it is to find a way to delay time.</p>
<p>  Theoretically speaking, everyone not participating in the event and boycotting transactions in Dadir City is the best way to delay the spread of its influence.</p>
<p>   But once people come, even if they don't make a transaction, the influence will still be produced.</p>
<p>  Businessmen are the most sensitive group, and they have their own set of logic for judging market potential. As long as the reputation of Dardir City is established, countless businesses will naturally come to take root.</p>
<p>  When the merchants come and the goods are abundant, the market will develop. At that time, the nobles nearby will not be able to resist it!</p>
<p>   You can't go to other cities hundreds of miles away to make transactions just to take a gamble, right?</p>
<p>   "That's the best, but we can't ignore the small actions of the local nobles, otherwise they will cause us a big mess.</p>
<p>  Especially the mountain baron, you must focus on it. To be able to manage the territory impressively is definitely not a reckless man who only knows how to fight and kill.</p>
<p>   There is also the baron from the Dalton family, who is said to be about to graduate from the Academy of Magic. Although the location of his territory is not as good as Dardir City, it is also the heartland of Wyton County.</p>
<p>  Considering the background behind him, there are definitely a lot of resources that can be mobilized. If you jump out and compete with us for the commercial center of the southern region, there will still be many supporters. "</p>
