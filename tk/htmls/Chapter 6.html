    Chapter 6 Team Training
   </p>
   <p>
    "Didn't you eat? Everyone cheer me up!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sweat more in normal times, and bleed less in wartime. Why are you idiots so ignorant..."
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the scorching sun, Hudson looked at the group of sweating teenagers and reprimanded them endlessly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the completion of the selection of knight attendants, this scene has become the norm, and everyone has long seen it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Knights are born for war, and it is only a matter of time before they go to the battlefield, so naturally they have to keep up as servants. Not only to kill the enemy, but also to act as a human shield at critical moments.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the sake of his own life, Hudson put in all his strength and used all the training knowledge in his mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    After three months of tossing, the ten people in front of them can be regarded as well-trained. Even the majestic Baron Redman expressed his affirmation of Hudson's achievements, bluntly saying that he has the potential to be a general.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's a pity that potential is always just potential. Hudson, who has been beaten by society, doesn't think he is so good.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regardless of what the outside world thinks, the opponent's training has never been relaxed.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you pay attention to your surroundings, you will find that Baron Redman is watching with his three young sons not far away, or stealing from him.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no way, in this closed world, knowledge is so rare. Especially military-related knowledge, I can't find a place to learn it, so I can only slowly explore and summarize it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The scattered notes of the elders are the most precious inheritance of the nobility.
   </p>
   <p>
    The great aristocrats can always occupy the upper hand, a large part of the reason is the monopoly of knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The training method that Hudson thought was insignificant was invaluable to Baron Redman. If you are too embarrassed to ask your son for it, you can simply learn and record from the sidelines.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a pain for the three little guys. They are naughty at their age, and with the doting of the baroness, they don’t even know how precious the knowledge in front of them is. Baron Redman’s hard work is destined to be in vain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Especially Lesur, who is staring at Hudson with resentment at the moment. If Baron Redman's attention was not on him, a meal of fried pork with bamboo shoots would have been unavoidable.
   </p>
   <p>
    After hesitating for a long time, Lesur finally couldn't help but said: "Father, my basic knight training has been completed, look at the life essence..."
   </p>
   <p>
    Before he could finish speaking, Baron Redman's expression darkened suddenly, he gave him a hard look, and said nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The more so, the more disturbed Lesur was. For this life essence, he paid a heavy price. If he couldn't get the life essence, it would be a real blood loss.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a last resort, I can only hope that my two younger brothers will help me to intercede. It's a pity that the children of the nobles are all precocious, even if they are brothers, they can't stand that everyone is now a competitor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Family resources are limited. If you get more, I get less. There is no way. Lesur committed a big taboo, if he can be kicked out, it will be good for everyone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Didn’t add insult to injury, it’s all for the sake of brotherhood. After exchanging glances with Lesur, the two little brats looked away tacitly.
   </p>
   <p>
    This scene happened to fall into the eyes of Baron Redman. It's just that all this in front of him is not enough to move him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The aristocratic world is cruel. If you don’t fight or grab, you won’t be able to gain a foothold in this world of the jungle.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chivalry qualities: humility, honesty, compassion, valor, justice, sacrifice, honor, soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    The survival rule of the nobility is: interests first, hypocrisy, utilitarianism, selfishness, rationality... are all necessary skills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only after satisfying survival, will the noble spirit be born: integrity, morality, sense of mission...
   </p>
   <p>
    What you can’t get is always the best, and what everyone admires the most is often what everyone lacks the most in real life.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Don't be distracted, watch Hudson's training carefully, it will be good for your future development."
   </p>
   <p>
    Baron Redman said earnestly.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all, he is his own son, and he cannot be completely ruthless. In his view, Lysur is now completely putting the cart before the horse. Rather than thinking about the life essence that does not belong to him, it is better to take the opportunity to learn more knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, after discovering Hudson's military training talent at first, Baron Redman also wanted him to train an elite army.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, my own pockets are not rich, so I can't afford a standing army at all. In the entire barony, the only armed force is the castle's guard of less than fifty people.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the number of people is small, it is natural to pay more attention to individual combat effectiveness. What's more, the guards and the army themselves are not the same type, and applying it mechanically will only be self-defeating.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a sense, the art of military training is a piece of cake for the little nobles. Only by defecting to the king or the great nobles can they be useful.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not knowing what his father was planning, Hudson still worked hard to train his men. In this world of extraordinary power, it is difficult for ordinary people to compete with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even a junior knight like Hudson can easily defeat more than a dozen strong men. This is the basis for the aristocratic group to be able to rule the world all the time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Limited by the monopoly of resources, coupled with the tacit understanding of the noble group, the life essence never leaks out, and it is almost impossible for common people to become knights. An extraordinary route suitable for ordinary people, only warriors.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is also extraordinary, a knight of the same realm completely beats a warrior. Not only because of the support of the mount, but the most important thing is the awakening of the seed of life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although Hudson doesn't know what the life seed is, he has experienced the benefits of awakening the life seed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The most intuitive feeling is that the overall quality of the body has improved. After each high-intensity training, the seeds of life will release a burst of energy to repair physical damage.
   </p>
   <p>
    In contrast, soldiers are much more miserable. Without the support of life seeds, there are many hidden injuries left in daily training, let alone on the battlefield.
   </p>
   <p>
    Long-lived knights are not uncommon, but there are very few long-lived warriors, and they usually don't live to be fifty years old. A short lifespan naturally limits the improvement of strength. Looking at the entire continent, there are only a handful of strong fighters.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for the mysterious magician, that is Hudson's knowledge blind spot, and only a few strokes in the family book collection can't explain the problem.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not to mention other niche occupations, ordinary people will never encounter them once in a lifetime, and Hudson has no way to learn about them.
   </p>
   <p>
    If it is just to train knight servants, a simple training is enough, and there is no need to work so hard.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all, I still have a restless heart. Even if my heart keeps saying that I need to "give it up", my body is still very honest and trying to cultivate the team.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first pot of gold in life is always the most difficult to obtain. Right now there are only ten people available, although the number is not many, it is better than none.
