Although Hudson is also concerned about current affairs, the change of crown prince of the Beamon family is obviously too far away from him.</p>
<p>   Except for the sudden southward invasion of the Orc Empire, no matter how shocking the news, it will not affect Hudson's farming plan.</p>
<p>   If one heir dies, aren't there still countless heirs? Emperor Bimon was a blessed man. Although his sons passed away one after another, they had many grandchildren!</p>
<p>  Prince Alex alone has created more than 300 people for him, and with the contributions of other princes, even if it has not reached 400, it is not far from this number.</p>
<p>Plus great-grandsons, great-great-great-grandsons... It is estimated that there will be several regiments. If you live a few decades longer than Emperor Meng, maybe the descendants of Guang's direct line will be able to form an army. It can be called the monarch with the most descendants in the continent of Aslante one.</p>
<p>  There is definitely no one in the human world who can stand shoulder to shoulder with him, and the elves, dwarves, giants, berserkers with lower fertility...all of them are incomparable.</p>
<p>   It is estimated that only those races that have one litter at a time can compete with Emperor Meng in terms of the number of offspring.</p>
<p>  Fortunately, more than 90% of them are strange races with varying combat effectiveness, otherwise, other races in the mainland would not be able to mix.</p>
<p>  In fact, there were only a few dozen races in the Orc Empire at the beginning, and later because of various hybrids, a bunch of messy races appeared one after another.</p>
<p>  Even scholars who specialize in the study of races can't figure out how many races there are in the orc empire. After all, although Prince Alex's kind of strange and alternative species that is keen on creating races is rare, a few are still born occasionally.</p>
<p>  No matter how powerful the experts and scholars are, the speed of researching new races cannot keep up with the speed of their creation.</p>
<p>  In comparison, the human world is much simpler. Even if it is a cross-race combination, the birth is half-elf, half-orc, half... The probability of creating a new race is not high.</p>
<p>  Thinking about it, I feel... Forget it, these extravagant and lustful things are not something a small nobleman should think about.</p>
<p>  Looking at the inefficient land reclamation team, Hudson was secretly worried. According to the current efficiency, it is estimated that the Lord of Dawn does not know when he will be able to develop the Salam Mountains.</p>
<p>   What's more, there is a huge swamp on the other side of the mountain range. Going all the way along the swamp, it is not clear exactly where it will go, but Hudson guesses that the end of the swamp may be the sea.</p>
<p>  The reason is very simple. The southeast province is originally a coastal province, and the swampland that divides the border with neighboring countries is not surprising that it can extend all the way to the sea.</p>
<p>   It was not included in the territory of the two countries. In addition to the special local terrain, it is most likely because everyone is too busy.</p>
<p>  The Kingdom of Alpha is facing the threat of orcs all the year round. Ignoring the daily small-scale conflicts for the time being, the orc empire will definitely launch a southward invasion in as short as ten or twenty years, and as long as 70 or 80 years.</p>
<p>  The scale of the war has no logic at all. Even if it is just a medium-scale invasion, it will cause the Alpha Kingdom's vitality to be severely damaged.</p>
<p>  The Salam Mountains were not developed, and a large part of the reason was caused by the war. After all, after every population boom, what greeted them was war, and there was no time to play with population overflow.</p>
<p>  Including Wright County where Hudson is located, it was only developed more than 300 years ago, and the time it was actually developed was only more than 100 years ago. Some young villages may have been opened up twenty or thirty years ago.</p>
<p>  The small and medium-sized nobles have limited strength. Given the choice, no one would abandon the plains and go to develop hilly areas.</p>
<p>   I don't want to touch the hills, and no one cares about the swamp behind the hills. With the investment in developing this swamp, it is better to dig deep into the potential of our own territory.</p>
<p>  After all, not everyone is like Hudson, who set himself a grand strategic goal from the very beginning. It is difficult for most small and medium nobles to have a clear development plan, and most of the time they follow their neighbors to learn from each other.</p>
<p>  As for the other side of the swamp, it can be seen from the continental map that it is the Kingdom of Blackstone, and there are obvious lines on the border marked with four large characters - "Hessen Mountains".</p>
<p>   What is the specific situation, Hudson does not know. Anyway, there are markings on the map of the mainland, and it is said that there are monsters infesting, so it shouldn't be a small bag like the Salam Mountains, right?</p>
<p>  Looking at the scale of the swamp, you can tell that it is not the accumulated water produced by small soil bags like the Salam Mountains that can be washed out.</p>
<p>   You can't go on like this, even if there is no competitor on the opposite side, you can't waste time like this. In case the orcs really came over one day, there would be no time for farming.</p>
<p>  Looking at a group of security chiefs who were summoned, gathered together in twos and threes to discuss, Hudson said angrily: "Why do you have a good chat?</p>
<p>  Happy things can’t be enjoyed alone, shouldn’t your lord be happy too?</p>
<p>   If your wasteland reclamation progress can be as efficient, I will be very happy! "</p>
<p>  The scene in front of him frightened all the security chiefs. Although they hang up an official position, they are actually ordinary people.</p>
<p>  The only preferential treatment is to increase the monthly ration by ten pounds. The privileges and the like are too short to breed for the time being.</p>
<p>   Bureaucracy, even if they want to learn, no one in the territory can teach them.</p>
<p>   "Nonsense, I won't say much. Starting today, we will divide an area with Bao as the unit, and carry out land reclamation separately, and evaluate once a month.</p>
<p>   For the five best-performing guarantees, the meat supply of all people will increase by 1 pound per month, and the supply of miscellaneous grains will increase by 5 pounds. Among them, the best performer, the reward will be doubled directly.</p>
<p>  The five worst-performing guarantors, the guarantor himself gave me an explanation. If there is no reasonable explanation, the head of the security will be dismissed, and the ration supply of all the members of the security will be reduced by 5 pounds per month.</p>
<p>  Later, livestock and agricultural tools will be divided in units of insurance. I don't care how you allocate internally.</p>
<p>  Anyway, I only look at the final result. If anyone dares to hold me back in the land reclamation, I will break his leg first! "</p>
<p>   Hudson reprimanded sharply.</p>
<p>  The efficiency of grinding foreign workers is really too low, so we must find a way to make the people below roll up. Otherwise, how could he achieve the noble life that Master Hudson dreamed of?</p>
<p>  Theoretically speaking, direct distribution of production to households can most improve production enthusiasm. It is a pity that things that are deviant and challenge the rules of the game often do not end well when they set a precedent in history.</p>
<p>   As an orthodox aristocrat, Hudson does not want to be an alternative in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>  If there are too many people who don't like him, if he is sued to the capital for not fulfilling the lord's obligations, and the king directly revokes his status as a noble lord, it will be completely cold.</p>
<p>  Don't doubt that such martyrs have already appeared. In the process of historical development, all kinds of wonderful things will happen.</p>
<p>  Many things do not need to discuss the essence of right and wrong, as long as people around you think you are wrong, then you must be wrong.</p>
<p>  Don't try to argue, because one person can never change the cognition of a group of people. Perhaps one day in the future, this matter will be re-defined more objectively, but you must not see what violates the rules.</p>
<p>   What's more, in the process of land reclamation, teamwork is even more needed. It is enough to let the people below roll up, there is no need to put yourself into the vortex of the storm.</p>
<p>  If you really want to play with the family responsibility system, it is estimated that the most resistant person is the leader. If you hang out with the lord, although your life may not be good, you will definitely have less troubles.</p>
<p>   I don’t have enough personal freedom, but I don’t need to worry about everything from birth to death. Even if there is a famine, the lord is responsible for carrying it around. Anyway, they can't let them starve to death.</p>
<p>  Different from the Eastern Dynasty in the previous life, the folk clans are powerful, they can unite clans as a unit to resist risks together, and have the basis for reforming the feudal system.</p>
<p>   Serfs who have not formed a clan, if they come out and work alone, I don’t know if their life will be better. Anyway, the ability to resist risks is almost zero. Any disaster can take away everything they have.</p>
<p>  The lord's decision cannot be changed, and the good mood of the guards who didn't want to break their legs disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>  I originally thought that if I became the chief security officer and won the trust of the lord, I would be able to live a happy life and reach the pinnacle of life from then on.</p>
<p>  Facts have proved that there are no pies that fall for nothing in this world. It is simply impossible to just take the benefits and not do anything.</p>
<p>  No one dares to ignore Hudson's warning. The aristocrats said they would break their legs, but they would really break their legs. No one thought that one of their legs could be as important as the reputation of the aristocrats.</p>
<p>   Seeing his subordinates frowning, Hudson didn't have the heart to advise them. The more this kind of time, the more able to exercise a person.</p>
<p>  Whether it is a talent or a fool can be seen as soon as the follow-up land reclamation project starts.</p>
<p>  If it is trash, then kick it down as soon as possible. In the entrepreneurial stage, the destructive power brought by a waste entering the management team is not a little bit.</p>
<p>   At any rate, there are more than 20,000 people in the territory. Slowly screening, you can always find potential stocks suitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>  …</p>
<p>   Maple Leaf Collar, watching the neighbor next door enthusiastically playing land reclamation, Baron Kettley almost drools with envy.</p>
<p>  Obviously everyone started their business together, but as a result, other people's territories have entered the fast lane of rapid development, while their own family is still running wildly on the road of making ends meet.</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley has completely sneered at the statement that "Southern Xinjiang is rich, and the ground is full of gold. If you just sprinkle some seeds, you can get a big harvest."</p>
<p>  The southeastern province is indeed rich, and his own territory is indeed fertile, but these do not mean that he is rich.</p>
<p>  If you want to make a fortune, you must at least develop the territory first. With the current development status of Maple Leaf Collar, it is difficult to maintain the balance of income and expenditure.</p>
<p>   "Uncle Holman, where is the slave sent by the family, and how long will it take to arrive?"</p>
<p>   Baron Kettler asked concerned.</p>
<p>  Insufficient labor force has become the most critical factor restricting the development of Maple Leaf Collar. Under the background of not being able to get enough livestock and serfs, he could only make orc slaves.</p>
<p>  " Counting the days, it should be about to enter the border of the southeast province now, and it will be sent to the territory after ten days and a half at most.</p>
<p>   It's just Kettler, these orc slaves are not so easy to manage. Without some training, it is difficult to make them obedient.</p>
<p>   Moreover, the slaves sent by the family this time are as many as dozens of races, and language communication alone is a big problem.</p>
<p>  For the convenience of management, we must screen out the races suitable for farming as soon as possible, and find a way to deal with the rest! "</p>
<p>   Knight Holman said murderously.</p>
<p>  As a knight who came down from the battlefield, the most indispensable thing is to kill decisively. The conflict between the human race and the orcs has long been irreconcilable.</p>
<p>  Having a large number of orc slaves in the territory is a high-risk thing in itself. Even if the lord is not afraid of these guys making trouble, the serfs below can't stand it.</p>
<p>  In the event of turmoil, the Maple Leaf collar, which is already struggling to make ends meet, will get even worse.</p>
<p>   "Don't worry, Uncle Holman. The extra slaves will not be wasted. If we can't use them, it doesn't mean the neighbors can't use them either.</p>
<p>   Orc slaves are indeed mostly horribly stupid, and they can mess up even the simplest things. But it is still possible to do some purely physical work that does not require brains.</p>
<p>  Although there are some suspicions of supporting the enemy in doing this, we don’t do this kind of thing, and other people will do it.</p>
<p>  The Maple Leaf Territory has been short-lived for a long time, and the territories of other nobles are similar. In the two counties of Wright and Wyton, except for the rich and powerful mountain territories, almost all the territories are unable to make ends meet.</p>
<p>   Those local nobles are okay, the autumn plowing is finally completed, as long as they support the past few months, they can almost maintain the balance in the future.</p>
<p>  If they can reduce expenses, give up unnecessary interpersonal expenses, and reduce their daily living standards. After a maximum of one or two years, you will be able to turn losses into profits.</p>
<p>  But we are different. The army is the foundation for us to go south, but it is also a mountain that weighs on our heads.</p>
<p>  There is no military subsidy from the kingdom, no smuggling business to do, no objects to plunder, and only relying on the output of the territory, the pressure to feed so many soldiers is too great.</p>
<p>  But before the local nobles officially accept us, it is impossible not to maintain so many troops.</p>
<p>  If the territory cannot be developed as soon as possible, my savings will not last long. Even if I know that selling a slave to a mountain baron is a cup of poison with honey, I can only drink it first.</p>
<p>   Otherwise, the finances will collapse before the territory fully resumes production, and it will be all over. "</p>
<p>   Baron Kettley couldn't help sighing.</p>
<p>  If you are not in charge of the family, you don't know the difficulty of the lord. Before the war, the Maple Leaf collar was rich in products and fat; but a war destroyed all of this.</p>
<p>  In fact, the same is to raise soldiers, a mature territory, and a semi-disabled territory, the cost of raising soldiers is completely different.</p>
<p>  A mature territory can be self-sufficient in food, cloth, meat, oil, etc. Even if the weapons and equipment are broken, they can repair them by themselves.</p>
<p>  The main expenditure of the lord to raise soldiers is to buy salt, update and replace weapons and equipment, and war horses.</p>
<p>   Serf soldiers do not need to pay military salaries. Even if they are elites composed of practitioners, the lords only need to pay some subsidies in normal times.</p>
<p>   Whether to use coins or distribute food, cloth, and meat products depends on the mood of the lord, and the soldiers will not be picky.</p>
<p>  Cultivate the fields during the busy farming period, and practice during the slack period. As long as there is no war, military spending can usually be maintained at a low figure.</p>
<p>  Southern nobles like to cultivate cultivator guards, which is mainly determined by their environment. Generally speaking, the world is peaceful, and conflicts are mostly regional armed brawls.</p>
<p>  The guard team composed of practitioners is obviously more dominant in daily fights. What's more, they want to imitate the northern Xinjiang nobles to train the army, and the small nobles do not have such conditions.</p>
<p>  In daily fights, only brave and ruthless fighters can be cultivated, while ordinary sergeants cannot become elites without experiencing fighting on the battlefield.</p>
<p>   Battles like the suppression of the Skull and Bones rebellion are rarely seen in decades in the southeastern provinces, and it depends entirely on luck.</p>
<p>  Most of the time, the cult rebellion was suppressed by the lord himself with his guards, and there were very few people who could make trouble.</p>
<p>  Although noble lords often engage in fights, they cannot fight each other to the death. The intensity of the conflict can only be regarded as an armed conflict, far less than a real war.</p>
<p>  After meeting the daily needs of armaments, most nobles in southern Xinjiang like to spend money on daily life, training younger generations and maintaining personal connections. There is also a contingency reserve if you have the means to spare.</p>
<p>  Because of the different levels of investment in cultivation resources, even if they seldom go to the battlefield, the personal force of the southern aristocratic children is generally no worse than that of the northern Xinjiang aristocratic children. After all, actual combat ability can also be compensated by realm.</p>
<p>  The production of the Maple Leaf Collar has not yet recovered, but it is in the embarrassing stage of transition from the northern nobility to the southern nobility. Baron Kettley's life is naturally sad.</p>
<p>  In order to keep the territory's finances from going bankrupt and get through this lean period, he had to temporarily give up the resentment in his heart.</p>
<p>   "Kately, it's best for you to think like this. In the world of nobles, there are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests.</p>
<p>   I don’t know if you have noticed that the military strength of the southeastern native nobles in Wright and Wyton counties is constantly increasing, while the military strength of us northern nobles is constantly being weakened.</p>
<p>  Taking the Maple Leaf collar as an example, the 300 private troops who went south with us, because of the non-combat attrition caused by the previous battle and acclimatization, there are now 278 people left, which is almost a fifteenth reduction.</p>
<p>  Other territories, although there is no detailed data, it is estimated that they are not much better. Some guys who love to toss may lose more than one-tenth of their staff.</p>
<p>   In a short period of time, we can still suppress a group of local nobles, but as time goes by, the strength of the two sides will still be gradually drawn closer.</p>
<p>  If we cannot properly handle the relationship with our neighbors, our life will be very sad in the future, and we may even be excluded. "</p>
<p>  After hearing the reminder from Holman, Baron Kettley's expression became more serious. Although he also found that something was wrong, he didn't expect the problem to be so serious.</p>
<p>   In the battle between the nobles, winning is the long-term future, and a temporary win or loss does not mean anything. Only the winner who survives to the end is the real winner.</p>
<p>   You can't beat the other party to death with a stick, so if you can't form a deadly feud, it's best not to form a deadly feud; the grievances that can be resolved must be resolved as much as possible.</p>
<p>   Sometimes turning an enemy into a friend is also a strategic victory.</p>
<p>  I thought that selling slaves to neighbors was just to make up for the financial deficit, but now it seems that this is not only a business, but also a starting point for breaking the ice.</p>
<p>   No matter how other noble lords of northern Xinjiang choose, there is no choice for the Maple Leaf leader anyway. The neighbors are too powerful, there is really no chance of winning if they are reckless, and the only one who will suffer if they continue to be hostile can only be themselves.</p>
<p>  Even if there is a real grudge, you can keep it in your heart first, and then slowly settle it when you have an opportunity later. If there is no chance, just keep it in your heart. Kettley is not the master of the city without a plan.</p>
<p>   "Uncle Holman, thank you for your reminder, I know what to do next.</p>
<p>  Hudson can sell us the means of production of iron products for profit, why can't I sell slaves to these southern Xinjiang nobles for profit?</p>
<p>   This business must not only be done, but also must be made a lot of money. Send someone to find out which families are transporting slaves to the south. If they don't need that much, try to find a way to take them over at a low price.</p>
<p>   Hudson is the best example. If you want to earn more, you can only make your business a monopoly.</p>
<p>  It is now winter, and it is impossible to go deep into the orc empire to catch slaves in the short term. Even if they recover after the beginning of spring, sending the slaves over will be a matter of next summer.</p>
<p>   This means that in the next half a year, this group of slaves will be the only orc slaves.</p>
<p>  I hope that the number of slaves transported by each family will not be too many this time, otherwise our family will not be able to eat, and this business will not be easy to do! "</p>
