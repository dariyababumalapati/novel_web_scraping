  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Orc Empire.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Anyone would feel anxious if they saw their next-door neighbor thriving while their own family was still struggling with a civil war.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The four royal families were obviously more anxious. Unlike the Seven Clans Alliance, which had no way out and could only fight to the end, these vested interests had more concerns.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The plan did not keep pace with the changes. The plan to divide the Seven Tribes Alliance was successful, but the plan to disintegrate the Seven Tribes Alliance failed.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The operation of "Six Peaches Killing Seven Warriors" can only make the seven tribes feel suspicious, but they are still bound by contracts.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Magic contracts are so useful, but they have not been popularized. On the one hand, it is because the cost is too high, and on the other hand, people are worried that someone will tamper with the contract.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Like the elves and the Alpha Kingdom, both sides have powerful sanctuary masters, which can ensure that the other party cannot tamper with the contract.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Seven Clans Alliance is not a magician, so if someone really tampers with the contract, it may not be discovered.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this is just a normal operation. The seven tribes each prepared a contract and signed seven magic contracts at one time.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can choose not to believe the magic contract provided by others, but you cannot ignore the one provided by yourself.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders of each ethnic group are all signatories to the treaty, and even if they have doubts about their allies, they have no choice but to go ahead with it.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the credibility of the four royal families is far from being able to convince everyone with just a promise.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Every time when they hesitated, everyone couldn't help but think: What if after the seven clans became six clans, the four royal families suddenly turned against us?
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If this deadlock cannot be solved, no one dares to really sell out their teammates. Otherwise, as long as they slow down a little bit each time they act, without violating the contract, the seven tribes can become six tribes.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be precise, the Seven Clans Alliance now consisted of more than just seven clans. Through coercion, inducement, and alliances, another group of clans were deceived.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the situation has developed to this point, the neutral faction no longer exists. The four royal families and the seven-family alliance each brought a group of younger brothers and directly divided the Orc Empire into two.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The power gap between the two sides was also further narrowed. When it came to disputes over the core interests of races, the closer the power, the harder it was to resolve.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dear emperors, we can't delay any longer. We must take drastic measures to quickly suppress this rebellion, otherwise there will be endless troubles!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crown Prince Daniel tried hard to persuade.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was not so well versed in political affairs, but Daniel had a very thorough understanding of military issues.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The core reason for the failure of the previous military operations was that the four royal families had their own thoughts. They agreed to act together, but at the last minute, something changed.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, the well-planned plan turned into a tactic of adding fuel to the fire. If he, the commander, had not adjusted the strategic deployment in time, he might have been pushed back by the enemy.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, this tragedy only occurs in joint operations. When several royal families work alone, the coordination of the army is much more powerful.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Marshal Daniel, the Seven Clans Alliance has become a force to be reckoned with. The human race is also eyeing us covetously. If we start a large-scale civil war at this moment, it will be easy for the enemy to take advantage of us.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   War is only a means, not the ultimate goal. Through this period of strategic confrontation, the Seven Clans Alliance also realized how powerful it was.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why fight and kill if we can solve the problem through negotiation! We are all members of the Orc Empire, fighting will only benefit the evil human race!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The words of the Eagle King made Daniel very angry. A few months ago, he was still calling for war and killing against the Seven Clans Alliance, but now he has changed his position.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This shamelessness alone is enough to prove that he is a qualified emperor.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ability to adapt to changing circumstances – full marks!
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, war is not about numbers. The Seven Clans Alliance may seem powerful, but it is actually at the end of its rope.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gathering a large number of races, it appears that the strength has doubled, but in reality it is just the opposite.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The more races there are, the more difficult it is to coordinate. The original seven races could still cooperate with each other. Now that so many brothers have been added, it is difficult to organize and coordinate.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If we launch a military operation against one of the tribes at this moment, their rescue speed will definitely drop significantly, and we have every chance to defeat them one by one!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Daniel said confidently.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ever since he witnessed the destructive power of his stupid teammates in the continental war, he has lost interest in the hastily assembled multi-ethnic coalition.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The speed of each tribe mobilizing its own army is 10, so the speed of mobilizing and communicating together is only 5 at most. Not only is the efficiency low, but even the combat effectiveness will be affected.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the seven races in the alliance, only the Behemoths have experience in commanding many races, and the rest are just poor people who are being exploited.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once I became the boss, I was still learning a lot of things. I hadn't even figured out how to manage my subordinates.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Three of you, I think what Daniel said is right. The current situation really should not be dragged on any longer.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let's all work together and pay a certain price to quell the rebellion first.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If we allow heretical ideas to spread, I am afraid that more and more races will demand power from us. You don't want to be on an equal footing with the vassal races below, right?"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Lion King spoke in support.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the political slogan at the beginning of the establishment of the Orc Empire was "achieving equality among all races", in reality this has never been fulfilled.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Over the countless years that have passed, the orc royal family has undergone many changes, but the essence remains "survival of the fittest."
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even at the peak of the orcs' dominance over the continent, only a few powerful tribes enjoyed the benefits of overlordship, and it had nothing to do with the ordinary races.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When it comes to core interests, everyone's faces change instantly. Without the offerings of the vassal races, the good days of the four royal families will be over.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Marshal Daniel, if we fully cooperate, how much will it cost to quell this rebellion?"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Bear King asked with concern.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although deep down in his heart, he looked down on the group of younger brothers that the Seven Clans Alliance had brought together, the other side's current military strength should not be underestimated.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unlike previous rebellions, where the rebels could be directly exterminated, this time there were too many races involved, and if all were killed, the Orc Empire would be severely damaged.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Letting them go is even more unacceptable. If even the rebels can be forgiven, how can the four royal families still have any dignity?
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This dilemma is the reason why the four royal families are hesitant and often contradictory in their actions.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the battlefield is ever-changing. No one knows how much it will cost until the war is over.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the situation this time is special. The cost of quelling the rebellion depends entirely on what results everyone wants.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If all the rebels are to be exterminated, the war will probably last for several years, or even more than ten years.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If only we could issue an amnesty order: only execute the main culprits, ignore the accomplices, and reward those who make meritorious contributions while serving their sentences!
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I think this disturbance will soon be calmed down. If necessary, we can also persuade members of the seven clans to rebel.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Regardless of whether it succeeds or not, it will shake the enemy's morale. After the rebellion is quelled, we can use these races as cannon fodder to attack the Near East and consume them!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Daniel said coldly.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once unfaithful, never used again.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Daniel, who cannot tolerate any grain of sand in his eyes, has already sentenced these rebellious races to death in his heart.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When such a tragedy happens, you can't just let your family suffer the consequences, you also have to drag your neighbors into sharing the pain.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, let's do it!
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, we must pay attention to the intensity and just destroy one or two of the big families to intimidate the rebels.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the rebels deserved death, but they couldn't all die in a civil war. The Empire suffered heavy losses, and the Alphas couldn't get away with it.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We don't expect a complete victory, but we must at least destroy their Near East strategy, otherwise there will be endless troubles!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Bear King said with a cruel heart.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the blink of an eye, it became "three to one". The Eagle King swallowed back any objections.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The four royal families acted together, and countless vassal races followed suit. The Seven Clans Alliance, which heard the news, was not to be outdone and immediately mobilized all of its clans.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The smoke of gunpowder filled the entire Orc Empire. The Alpha Kingdom spies, noticing something was wrong, immediately passed the news back to the kingdom.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at the information gathered in his hands, Hudson's expression suddenly became solemn.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the eyes of ordinary people, the outbreak of civil war in the Orc Empire is a good thing; but in Hudson's view, the most advantageous situation for the kingdom is for the orcs to be divided into two major camps and confront each other for a long time.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the long-term confrontation, the two major camps have been restraining each other, and the orcs have no time to interfere in the affairs of the Near East.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Near East has been developing rapidly in the past year or so, and the most important reason for this is that the orcs have no time to come and cause destruction.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once the two camps were determined, the situation would be completely different. No matter which side won, it would not tolerate the kingdom gaining a foothold in the Near East.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "well!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Isn't peaceful development good enough? Why do we always have to fight and kill?"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hudson sighed in his heart and shook his head. It was already very good to have such a long period of peaceful development. There is no such thing as perfect in the world.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The year 99994 is drawing to a close. If you count the time, 20 months have passed since the end of the war on the continent.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The civil war in the Orc Empire is still going on. Even if the two sides decide the winner immediately, it will take a lot of time to deal with the aftermath.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This means that the kingdom’s golden period of development will last at least another year.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Up to now, the main projects of the Near East Defense Line have basically come to an end, and some subsidiary projects are also under construction.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If we speed up the construction schedule, there is still hope that the defense line can be completed before the orcs invade.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only problem is: the magician group needs to suffer a little more.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the extraordinary world, magicians are the best construction team. But the magicians are used to being high and mighty, so it is not easy to get them to do hard labor.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Alpha Kingdom's magician corps was an exception. They were coaxed and fooled by Hudson and made to do a lot of hard work.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many magicians have been working on the front lines of construction since the end of the war. They did not have a holiday until the reefs in the coastal areas were almost cleared.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that the deadline has to be met, there is no choice but to recruit the kingdom's magicians for service again.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most miserable ones are undoubtedly the earth magicians and the necromancers. The former is a natural engineer, while the latter is the best "contractor".
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In comparison, although magicians from other departments also have work to do, it is far less miserable than magicians from these two departments.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Jose drafted an official document for me, telling the kingdom that the situation in the Orc Empire has suddenly changed, and the kingdom’s peaceful days are coming to an end.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking into account the situation in the Orc Empire, the Near East Front Command judged that the earliest time of the enemy's invasion would most likely be after next autumn, and the construction of the border defense line must be completed before then.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suggestion: The kingdom should recruit all earth magicians and necromancers to immediately go to the frontline to support construction. "
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hudson's words scared Jose.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Throughout the entire continent of Aslant, Hudson is the only one who dares to use the magician master as a laborer.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If another general dared to make such a suggestion, he would better not go out, lest he be beaten black and blue, and he would not know who did it.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially the phrase "recruit all...", it was simply a joke. Once the plan was approved, it would mean that even a powerful 8th-rank magician would have to join the engineering team on the front line.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Excellency, this is not too much."
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jose persuaded gently.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hudson was not afraid of getting into trouble, but he was afraid! If people knew that he was the one who drafted the document, the hatred would most likely be held against him.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't worry, there will be no problem. We have to trust the king. He will find a way to convince these wizards!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hudson said calmly.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no discrimination between professions. In his opinion, magic should be applied to production and life. If the magicians were not used to being high and mighty, the productivity of the Aslant continent would not be as low as it is now.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Building bridges and roads, repairing city walls, and constructing water conservancy projects are all the specialties of magicians. Often, a magic project would require the engineering team to work hard for several months.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just look at the construction speed of Xueyueling and you will know that the main construction of the water conservancy project was completed in less than a month after it was planned.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The price was that Hudson paid Bear Stearns and Maxim 10,000 gold coins each every day as their labor fee.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The main part was completed, but there were still many supporting works to be done. These delicate works could not be done by Bear Stearns and Maxim.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's not that they can't do the job, it's mainly because the fees are too high, and even the wealthy Mr. Hudson can't afford to hire them.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's a pity that the magician group in the territory has not grown. Except for those few pitiful magicians, the rest are still magic apprentices.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the magic apprentice's little magic power, he could only earn enough money for a lunch box by being sent to a construction site.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just because Hudson can't muster a group of magicians doesn't mean the kingdom can't either. The population base is there, and the kingdom has accumulated it over so many years, so there must be thousands of magicians.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, during the war, magicians always stayed in the safest place. Even if they suffered a great defeat, they were the first to evacuate. Their own safety factor was much higher than that of ordinary knights.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the Emerald Palace, Caesar IV, who was "placed with high hopes" by Hudson, was scratching his head in worry.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just after a few days of peace, the orcs caused trouble again, forcing the kingdom to take precautions.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Prime Minister, what do you think of Marshal Hudson's proposal?"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Caesar IV asked with concern.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was obvious that he had directly ignored the Near Eastern Front Command on the official document.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The "Near Eastern Front Command" was not just a name, but in reality it was all decided by Hudson.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This kind of power hollowing out was not intentional by Hudson, but because his prestige in the army was too high, and the deputy generals and military supervisors arranged by the kingdom could not serve as a check and balance at all.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only did they not check and balance, but after arriving at the place, these guys turned into Hudson's fans. Whatever the boss said, that was what they did.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Checks and balances", they haven't lived enough and don't want to die in the battlefield.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Caesar IV was naturally dissatisfied with this situation and replaced the core officials of the Near Eastern Front Command many times, but it was still useless.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without any foundation in the military, he wanted to command the entire army with just a letter of appointment from the king. This would be underestimating the noble officers on the front line.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Each of them is a brave and powerful soldier who has fought on the battlefield. How can an ordinary person control them?
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Alpha Kingdom was not structured as a joint-stock company, the brave frontline generals, including Hudson, would have long been a thorn in the kingdom's side.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After struggling for a while, seeing that no one wanted to play with him and even his own family members were against it, Caesar IV accepted the reality.
  </font></font></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the checks and balances of power fail, then simply give up. Use your energy to manage the royal territory. As long as the royal family is strong enough, the royal power cannot be shaken.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The problem of being too successful to be a threat to the master is just a minor problem. Anyway, there has never been a case of wearing a yellow robe in the Aslant continent.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if a political struggle occurred, what was fought for was the right to speak (shares) in the kingdom, not the sacred and inviolable throne.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Your Majesty, we must be on guard against the issues raised by Marshal Hudson!
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If we are not fully prepared and allow the enemy to take advantage of us, all our investment in the Middle East will be in vain.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For safety reasons, we can only speed up the construction of the defense line and complete it before the orcs are ready.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I think as long as the defense line is completed and Marshal Hudson personally guards the front line, the Near East will be safe.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Near East is stable, the Northern Frontier will be stable; if the Northern Frontier is stable, the Kingdom will be stable!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kaiser IV still heard the implicit reminder from the chancellor, the Grand Duke of Newfoundland. It didn't matter whether other regions were stable or not, the key was that the royal territory must be stable.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to develop new territories, the royal family made a huge bet, not only betting on the family's hundreds of years of accumulation, but also owing a large amount of debt.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If something unexpected happens in the Near East and the orcs invade the northern border, all the royal family’s investments will be lost.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If such a major loss occurs once, the royal family will have no chance of recovery in the next few decades.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone's interests are tied together, and the current situation is that the royal family and the Near East will suffer together and prosper together.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Well, let’s follow Marshal Hudson’s proposal and implement it as soon as possible.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Have someone prepare the carriage. I want to go to the School of Magic and the School of Arcane in person. If I don't convince those old guys, the conscription order won't be implemented!"
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Caesar IV said with an embarrassed look on his face.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No one could do this kind of work for him. Facing a bunch of old-timers, no one else could handle it unless the king did it himself.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if he personally took action, Caesar IV was not sure whether he could convince everyone.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the news that Hudson detained a group of magicians and ordered them to do hard labor some time ago is still circulating in the magician circle.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fact that Hudson was not criticized as "shit" was because everyone was being lenient. In order to maintain a balance of power, Caesar IV also secretly fanned the flames and took the opportunity to reduce Hudson's reputation.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The effect was very good, and many magicians in the kingdom were dissatisfied with Hudson. He never expected that it would be his turn as the king to be criticized not long after.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The previous order was issued by Hudson, so naturally it was his front-line commander who was criticized. The current mobilization order was issued by Caesar IV.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can imagine how everyone criticized Hudson some time ago, and how they will criticize him as the king next.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though he knew he would be scolded, he had no choice but to go ahead. After all, he was the king.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this critical moment, we must take the necessary responsibility.
  </font></font></p>
  <p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Besides, even if he was scolded, except for a few old-fashioned people, no one would scold him in front of him. If he didn't hear any scolding, he would just pretend it didn't exist.
  </font></font></p>
