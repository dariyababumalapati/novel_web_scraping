Chapter 1: I am Zhu Yunwen! I am the son of heaven of Ming dynasty!
The wind was fierce, and the rain poured down. The night was gloomy.
A bolt of lightning, like a roaring dragon, tore through the void and descended with awe-inspiring power, causing fear and trepidation in all things.
Su Changhe felt himself falling and abruptly woke up from his dream. As he tried to get up and brush off the rain from his body, intending to continue his visit to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, he realized that he was no longer on the steps of the mausoleum. [1]Ming Xiaoling (Chinese: 明孝陵; pinyin: Míng Xiào Líng; lit. ‘Filial mausoleum of Ming’) is the mausoleum of the Hongwu Emperor, … Continue reading
“His Majesty’s awake! His majesty’s awake! Inform the imperial physician quickly! May the heavens protect us…”
A eunuch wearing a Three Mountains hat, with a white cloth wrapped around his forehead, and dressed in a blue-gray python robe, shouted in a neutral voice.
Su Changhe was instantly stunned.
His Majesty?
Could it be that he had traveled from Nanjing to Hengdian?
Which film crew is this?
Turning his head, Su Changhe saw that the hall was brightly lit. On the ceiling, there were intricately carved patterns of coiling dragons, which looked extremely lifelike.
Above the golden doors, there were two dragons playing with a pearl.
In the center, there was a square platform adorned with a golden-carved dragon throne and golden-carved dragon screens.
In front of the throne, there were objects such as Lu Duan, cranes, and incense burners.[2]Luduan (甪端 pinyin: lùduān) is a legendary Chinese auspicious creature. It looks like a deer with green coat, the tail of a horse and a … Continue reading
In front of the platform, there were four copper-bodied cloisonné incense burners, emitting a fragrant smoke as sandalwood burned.[3]Cloisonné (French: [klwazɔne]) is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects with colored material held in place or separated by metal strips or wire, … Continue reading
Further away, there was also a large dragon cabinet.
“The arrangement, why does it resemble the Qianqing Palace in the Ming Imperial Palace?” Su Changhe muttered to himself. He felt a slight itch on his head and reached up to touch it. A sharp pain shot through his bones, and at the same time, a wave of unfamiliar memories flooded his mind.[4]The Palace of Heavenly Purity, or Qianqing Palace (Chinese: 乾清宫; pinyin: qiánqīng … Continue reading
The owner of these memories was named Zhu Yunwen!
Zhu Yunwen?[5]The Jianwen Emperor (5 December 1377 – ?), personal name Zhu Yunwen (朱允炆), was the second Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1398 to 1402. The era … Continue reading
Su Changhe widened his eyes, unable to comprehend how he could have Zhu Yunwen’s memories.
Time travel?
Reincarnation?
Have I died once before?
Su Changhe couldn’t make sense of it all and felt absurd.
“Your Majesty, how do you feel? Has your condition improved?”
A gentle and dignified woman dressed in white approached. After a slight bow, she knelt by the bedside and looked at him with deep concern and worry in her eyes.
Su Changhe shifted his gaze, looking at the arrangement in the room. He got off the bed and walked to the door without having time to put on his shoes. He opened the door.
A bolt of lightning split the dark night sky, and magnificent palaces flashed before his eyes in an instant.
“Your Majesty, it’s stormy outside. Please take care of your health,” Ma Enhui followed and earnestly pleaded.
Su Changhe turned around, looking at Ma Enhui, and asked with a puzzled expression, “What happened? Why am I here?”
Ma Enhui hurriedly replied, “Your Majesty, have you forgotten? Since your enthronement and assuming the governance of the country, you have always remembered Emperor Taizu and frequently visited the Xiaoling Mausoleum. This morning, while visiting the mausoleum, you accidentally slipped and injured your head.”
“The Xiaoling Mausoleum?”
Su Changhe remembered that he was touring the Xiaoling Mausoleum and had indeed taken a fall.”
Different time!
Same location, same event!
A bolt of lightning stirred up the wind and rain six hundred years ago…
Su Changhe felt that strange memory was becoming familiar. It looks like he was indeed Zhu Yunwen, the emperor of the Ming Empire!
However, in this segment of memories, Su Changhe didn’t see great talent, didn’t see a magnanimous person, instead a cowardly, timid, and cautious.
“is this true?”
As Su Changhe walked around, memories were overlapping and restructuring, and a clear distinction between an era and reality gradually emerged in his mind.
Today is the 31st year of Hongwu, June 10th!
A month ago, Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang died.[6]The Hongwu Emperor (21 October 1328 – 24 June 1398),[5] personal name Zhu Yuanzhang (Chinese: 朱元璋; Wade–Giles: Chu Yuan-chang), courtesy … Continue reading
Because the year name cannot be changed until next year, it still cannot be called the first year of Jianwen yet, but the year of Hongwu.
The hundred-day period of observing mourning, which includes abstaining from meat and fish, refraining from ceremonial music, abstaining from marital relations, and wearing plain clothing, has just begun and hasn’t even been a month yet.
At this moment, Zhu Yunwen has just taken power.
“Of course it’s true, Your Majesty fainted at that time…”
Ma Enhui quickly explained.
“Fainted? Won’t that news spread?”
Su Changhe knew that although Zhu Yuanzhang had passed the throne to Zhu Yunwen, the coveted supreme throne would attract more than just one or two individuals.
Especially King of Yan, Zhu Di!
It was he who later claimed “to be defending the righteous cause and stabilizing the kingdom”, and drove Emperor Jianwen, Zhu Yunwen, away.
“Your Majesty, please rest assured. We have already given orders, and no one dares to speak a word.”
The eunuch beside him spoke, and the imperial physician hurried over.
Su Changhe sat there, closing his eyes slightly. He didn’t understand why fate had made him Zhu Yunwen, one of the tragic emperors of the Ming Dynasty, who only reigned for four years.
In the end, he disappeared on his own, and his wife and children all died.
Oh, there was also a two-year-old child who was imprisoned for over fifty years, and shortly after being released, he died too.
Su Changhe didn’t hear what the imperial physician was saying. The haze of history and the merging of memories made it difficult for Su Changhe to distinguish whether he was a graduate student from the future or the real Zhu Yunwen!
The brilliance of lightning illuminated the room, and in an instant, rolling thunder followed.
Farewell, Su Changhe!
Now, I am Zhu Yunwen!
I am Emperor Jianwen, the unique ruler of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Di?![7]The Yongle Emperor (2 May 1360 – 12 August 1424), personal name Zhu Di (Chinese: 朱棣; pinyin: Zhū Dì; Wade–Giles: Chu Ti), was the third Emperor of … Continue reading
What you can do, I can do too!
I will defy the heavens and achieve supreme accomplishments!
I will become the Eternal Emperor, and let the Ming Dynasty become another golden age after the Han and Tang Dynasties! I am Zhu Yunwen!
I am the Emperor Zhu Yunwen!
I am the Emperor of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Yunwen slowly opened his eyes. In his gaze, there was no longer fear and cowardice, only resolute determination and fearlessness!
“Your Majesty, Left Assistant Minister of the Ministry of War Qi Tai and Hanlin Compiler Huang Zicheng seek an audience.”
A eunuch loudly reported.
Ma Enhui was about to reprimand them. The Emperor needed rest, so why would they seek an audience on a rainy night?
However, Zhu Yunwen waved his hand to stop Ma Enhui and calmly said, “It’s fine, let them come in.”
Zhu Yunwen was eager to see these two individuals, not because they were closely related to him, but because they were incredibly foolish. They had played a part in the downfall of the Jianwen reign, and their ideas were all impractical. It was truly a difficult situation for them.
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng entered the hall and knelt down to pay their respects, saying, “Minister Qi Tai (Huang Zicheng) pays respects to our holy and revered Emperor.”
Zhu Yunwen searched his memory. The thin face on the left with a graying beard, close to fifty years old, belonged to Huang Zicheng, while the relatively healthy figure on the right with a spirited appearance was Qi Tai.
“No need for formalities.”
Zhu Yunwen said in a deep voice.
After exchanging a few concerned words, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng exchanged a glance, and then Qi Tai began to speak, “Your Majesty, the regional kings currently have control over large military forces. From Gansu to Liaodong, there are nine major border kings commanding a total of 210,000 soldiers. Additionally, there are 160,000 soldiers in the Southern Desert Guard.”
“Among them, the forces under the control of King Ning are the strongest. He commands 80,000 archers and 6,000 war chariots, and his personal guards, the Duoyan Three Guards, are formidable and unstoppable.”
“Although King Yan has only over 40,000 troops, they are all seasoned warriors. Moreover, King Yan loves his soldiers as if they were his own children and has shown them countless favors. The army knows only of King Yan and has little knowledge of Your Majesty. We are afraid of potential disasters.”
“We have been restless day and night, and we implore Your Majesty to make a decisive decision early on, disband the regional kings, and take control of the military under the Five Army Commander’s Office. Only then can it be governed by Your Majesty and bring peace to the land…”
Zhu Yunwen nodded repeatedly as he listened. These two old men were wasting their talents by not joining pyramid schemes…
“Where is King Yan currently?”
Zhu Yunwen didn’t directly respond to Qi Tai.
Qi Tai was taken aback for a moment and said, “He should still be in Huai’an.”
“Huai’an?”[8]Huai’an, formerly Huaiyin, is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province in Eastern China.
A smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth.
In history, when Zhu Di heard the news of Zhu Yuanzhang’s death, he mourned day and night. However, he was blocked at Huai’an and was not allowed to enter the capital. He could only entrust Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui to mourn on his behalf.
Since I have come here, the mighty ship of the Ming Dynasty cannot run aground again.
“Summon King of Yan to the capital.”
Zhu Yunwen said gently.
These simple five words made Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng tremble, looking at Zhu Yunwen with confusion.

Chapter 2: Zhu Di’s three sons.
“Let the kings stay in their respective territories and not come to the capital.”
This is a sentence from Zhu Yuanzhang’s testament.
In simple terms, it means that after I, Zhu Yuanzhang, pass away, you sons should stay outside and not return to the capital for mourning.
After Zhu Yuanzhang’s death, Zhu Yunwen faithfully enforced this decree.
Well, there is only one exception, and that is Zhu Di.
As for the other uncles, they all cried and entered the capital.
Zhu Yunwen’s differential treatment naturally reveals his fear of Zhu Di. Although he used the testament as a command, his actions were not honorable.
In any matter, either treat everyone equally and not let anyone come, or let everyone come.
Allowing some but stopping one, what does that mean?
Isn’t it clearly bullying Zhu Di?
It’s almost like directly slapping Zhu Di in the face and telling him that if Zhu Yunwen doesn’t allow him to come, he can only wait outside.
If you don’t listen to me, you won’t succeed. What can you do?
Zhu Di, who was slapped in the face, must have felt uncomfortable. It’s understandable that he would go back, pound tables, smash chairs, throw cups, and then turn around to make weapons and buy provisions.
Regarding Zhu Yunwen’s previously foolish decisions, the current Zhu Yunwen feels helpless and sympathetic. Of course, Huang Zicheng is credited for these ideas.
“Your Majesty, summoning King Yan to the capital at this time, wouldn’t it contradict the previous decree? Changing the imperial decree overnight would damage Your Majesty’s authority…”
Huang Zicheng quickly advised.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “Before the decree was issued, the other Kings had not yet arrived in the capital. Now all the other Kings are in the capital, only King Yan is missing. How will people judge? Furthermore, our dynasty advocates benevolent and filial governance. King Yan is the fourth son of the founder of the dynasty, my fourth uncle. How can he not come to the capital?”
“Your Majesty, once King Yan enters the capital, there may be turmoil.”
Qi Tai also said uneasily.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the two of them and smiled, saying, “What turmoil would there be?”
Qi Tai replied, “King Yan once led a large army to campaign in the desert and has high prestige among the troops. In addition, he has close relations with the distinguished officials of the Five Armies Commandery. If he is allowed to stay in the capital and move about freely, he may gather popular support.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled indifferently, waved his hand, and said, “Very well, we can see where the imperial nobles stand. That’s settled then, make the arrangements.”
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng had no choice but to bow and leave.
Ma Enhui, seeing Zhu Yunwen in a good mood, accompanied him and whispered, “Today, Your Majesty seems different from before.”
Zhu Yunwen was secretly surprised and looked at Ma Enhui.
After all, she was his close confidante, and with a woman’s intuition, she could perceive the changes.
“A few days ago, His Majesty was afraid to meet King Yan, but now he has issued an edict to summon him to the capital. I don’t know how His Majesty is considering it.”
Ma Enhui continued speaking in detail.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui, pondering how to respond.
Ma Enhui seemed to sense something and quickly knelt down, saying, “Please forgive me, Your Majesty. I should never have meddled in state affairs.”
Zhu Yunwen, seeing a woman kneeling before him, had a collision of memories of ceremonial norms and equality in future generations in his mind. In the end, he stepped forward and helped Ma Enhui up, carefully looking at the woman before him.
It must be said that Ma Enhui’s appearance was truly outstanding.
Her peach blossom eyes and the captivating glimmer in her gaze were enchanting. Her fair skin had a rosy glow, and her slightly moving lips emanated a faint fragrance.
She was his wife.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and took Ma Enhui’s hand, sitting at the edge of the bed, saying, “You must accompany me for a hundred years!”
Ma Enhui smiled lightly, her beauty shining amidst the chaos.
Only Zhu Yunwen knew that she would die within this palace!
Four years later!
Unless he could resolve the issue with the vassal kings(藩王) , unless he could deal with Zhu Di!
He lacked military talent, but he could rely on the history in his mind and the experiences from the future.
And this would be his decisive advantage, where he would outpace Zhu Di!
Amidst the raging storm and thunderous lightning…
The headquarters of the Central Army Commandery.
Distinguished and extraordinary, Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, with a jade-like face and a noble bearing, was not resting but rather reviewing a batch of documents. As the son of Xu Da[1]Xu Da (1332–1385), courtesy name Tiande, was a Chinese military general and politician who lived in the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty. He was a friend of … Continue reading, the first renowned general of the founding era, Xu Huizu not only inherited Xu Da’s wisdom but also his courage.
Zhu Yuanzhang held high regard for Xu Huizu and entrusted him with the command of the Central Army Headquarters. At the young age of thirty, Xu Huizu ranked as the top military official.
Putting down the documents in his hands, Xu Huizu rubbed his slightly sore eyes and let out a sigh. He murmured to himself, “It seems that His Majesty intends to make a major move.”
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng had been advocating for the reduction of the vassal kings, and the Emperor had inquired multiple times about border defense matters, hinting at the removal of the border kings. The knife was already raised, it was just a matter of when and where it would strike.
Xu Huizu didn’t completely agree with the idea of reducing the vassal kings. Although reducing them would benefit the country’s stability and strengthen the main branch, the capital city was still located in the south, and the vast northern territory required a group of people to guard it and deter the Mongols.
“The heart of an emperor only asks for loyalty, not ability,” Xu Huizu felt somewhat powerless.
Indeed, he was the top military official, but he was far from being a trusted confidant of Zhu Yunwen. Zhu’s confidant was Li Jinglong, the Duke of Cao, the son of Li Wenzhong, the King of Qiyang. Xu Huizu knew Li Jinglong well. Apart from his striking appearance and elegant demeanor, Li Jinglong was actually a worthless person.
He lacked any strategy, yet held the position of Commander of the Left Army. But that’s what being a confidant gets you. Xu Huizu couldn’t compare to him.
As Xu Huizu looked out the window at the lightning and thunder, he felt a wave of oppression. Suddenly, someone reported, “His Majesty has issued an order to summon the King of Yan to the capital.”
Xu Huizu was taken aback and quickly inquired if the person was certain about the news. After receiving confirmation, Xu Huizu’s expression slightly changed. He didn’t know whether the Emperor’s move was a test or a banquet at Hong Gate.
“Uncle.”
A shout interrupted Xu Huizu’s contemplation. Zhu Gaochi[2]The Hongxi Emperor (16 August 1378 – 29 May 1425), personal name Zhu Gaochi (朱高熾), was the fourth Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1424 to 1425., with a plump and simple appearance and unsteady movements, entered the hall, followed by the remarkable Zhu Gaoxu[3]Zhu Gaoxu (Chinese: 朱高煦; 30 December 1380 – 6 October 1426), the Prince of Gaoyang (高陽王, created 1395), later the Prince of Han (漢王, created 1404), was … Continue reading and Zhu Gaosui[4].Zhu Gaosui (朱高燧; 19 Jan 1383 – 5 Oct 1431), third son of Yongle Emperor.
The three of them had come to the capital to mourn, but they hadn’t even had a chance to see Zhu Yuanzhang one last time. By the time they arrived in the capital, he had already been interred in the mausoleum. But since they had come, they could only stay in the capital. If they wanted to leave, they would have to wait until the mourning period was over.
Xu Huizu looked at his nephews, the three sons of Zhu Di, with a mix of admiration and concern in his eyes.
“Young princes, why are you still not resting at such a late hour?” Xu Huizu asked kindly.
Zhu Gaochi sat down and let out a sigh. He said, “These past few days of studying have been suffocating. My brothers and I have discussed it. Tomorrow, should we go to the martial arts field and hold a horseback archery competition? It would be a good way for us to unwind and have some fun.”
Xu Huizu pondered for a moment and gladly agreed, “No problem. Tomorrow happens to be free. We can invite some distinguished officials to participate as well and make it a grand event to showcase skills and compete.”
“In that case, we thank you, Uncle,” Zhu Gaochi and the others said as they saluted and left.
Xu Huizu turned and walked to the desk, immediately writing a secret letter and arranging for a trusted subordinate to deliver it discreetly to the palace. Then he stood by the window, watching the pouring rain outside, and murmured to himself, “It’s time for me to show my loyalty as well.”

Chapter 3: Education Needs Reform, Xu Miaojin enters the Imperial academy
Zhu Yunwen received Xu Huizu’s secret document and quietly burned the secret document to ashes.
After the rain, the sky cleared.
On this day, Zhu Yunwen didn’t work, read the documents, and didn’t go on walks with a palanquin. He just walked in the palace accompanied by Ma Enhui and several eunuchs.
The Forbidden City of the Ming Dynasty in later generations can only be said to be a ruin, and it cannot show the prosperity and prosperity of the capital of the Ming Empire at all.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion. He rarely walked on foot in the past but today he seemed to have the intention of strolling leisurely, Ma Enhui observe him calmly.
Some palace maids seeing him from afar knelt and paid their respect, and Zhu Yunwen would take a closer look.
“Your Majesty, when the new year comes, consider selecting some talented women to enter the palace…”
Ma Enhui’s words made Zhu Yunwen stagger, and the eunuch who was on the side hurriedly stepped forward to assist him. Zhu Yunwen waved his hand instructing them to step aside.
“I—I just feel that after the rain, everything becomes fresh. Let’s talk about those things later.”
Zhu Yunwen walked into Chang’an Palace, and upon entering, he heard a burst of light laughter.
Ma Enhui looked at frowning Zhu Yunwen, thinking he was angry. After all, although the national funeral was over, it hadn’t been long, and such bold laughter seemed inappropriate.
Ma Enhui hurriedly knelt down and said, “Your Majesty, it must be Miaojin[1]Xu Miao Jin 徐妙锦 (1380-1440). She was the third daughter of Xu Da, one of the founding generals of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife Lady Jia. According to Chen Lian’s “Qinxuan … Continue reading coming to visit Wenkui…”
Before the explanation could be clarified, a group of palace maids and court officials approached and knelt down one after another.
“Brother Emperor has arrived.”
A gentle female voice sounded.
Zhu Yunwen looked up and saw a young girl dressed in a willow-green robe and apricot-yellow long skirt, gracefully approaching.
With willow-shaped eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes, she possessed unparalleled beauty.
Her watery eyes sparkled, and her demeanor exuded a cool nobility, as well as a contradictory sense of innocence and radiance.
Xu Miaojin slightly bowed, paying her respects, and looked at Zhu Yunwen, speaking directly, “What’s wrong with your head? Can’t these servants take care of you properly?”
The eunuch behind Zhu Yunwen trembled and quickly knelt down, pleading for mercy, hoping that Xu Miaojin would go easy on them.
“Miaojin?”
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly.
Come to think of it, this is Xu Miaojin, the fourth daughter of one of the founding fathers Xu Da.
This was the first rare female in the Ming Dynasty. It is rumored that because of her, Zhu Di “actually emptied the palace and no more queen”, and did not establish another queen until his death.
At this time Xu Miaojin was only eighteen years old, and compared to Zhu Yunwen at this time, she was three years younger.
“You……”
Xu Miaojin blushed for a moment, she didn’t expect Zhu Yunwen to call her name directly.
Although the two were similar in age, and Xu Miaojin even jokingly called Zhu Yunwen “brother”, in reality, she was a generation older than him.
After all, Xu Yihua[2]Empress Renxiaowen (仁孝文皇后; 5 March 1362 – 6 August 1407), of the Xu clan, was the empress consort to the Yongle Emperor and the third empress … Continue reading, Xu Miaojin’s eldest sister, married Zhu Di, the King of Yan.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t care about this, and looked at Xu Miaojin with his serious face, and said softly: “Sister Xu, you have quite the audacity. It has only been a month since the passing of the late emperor, and here you are laughing and rejoicing without restraint. What kind of decorum is this??”
Caught off guard, Xu Miaojin forgot about the earlier incident and hastily replied, “According to the late emperor’s decree, the people of the realm mourn for three days and then resume their normal lives, including marriages. I am merely following the late emperor’s wishes. How can I be at fault?”
Zhu Yunwen was momentarily speechless. He hadn’t expected this young girl to be so sharp and skilled at using his grandfather’s authority against him.
Xu Miaojin snorted and continued, “As the emperor, you wear a gloomy expression and set an example for everyone. Who in the palace dares to be joyful? If the entire Ming Dynasty is like this, where is the vitality?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Miaojin, who was twisting his word and forcing logic. He smiled and said, “It’s not bad to be eloquent. By the way, do you want to work for me?”
Xu Miaojin widened her eyes and quickly shook her head in refusal.
In the Ming Dynasty, there were six bureaus and one department for female officials.
The six bureaus referred to Shanggong (尚宫, Palace Affairs), Shangyi (尚仪, Ceremonies), Shangfu (尚服, Wardrobe), Shangshi (尚食, Food), Shangqin (尚寝, Housekeeping), and Shanggong (尚功, Workshop). The overall management of these bureaus was handled by the Shanggong (尚宫, Palace Affairs) Supervisor.
The department was known as Yisi(一司 or “One department), which served as the disciplinary authority, responsible for regulations and punishments.
In simple terms, the role of female officials in the Ming Dynasty was to manage the affairs of the consorts and palace maidens. They served within the inner palace.
Xu Miaojin was not part of the inner palace but belonged to the Xu Family. With her noble status, it was highly unlikely for her to become a female official in the palace.
Even Ma Enhui, who was standing beside them, felt surprised by this request as it was highly inappropriate.
Zhu Yunwen, however, disregarded these constraints and said to Xu Miaojin, “I know you possess innate goodness, intelligence, and a thirst for knowledge. With the empire now at peace and me ascending the throne, it is a time to employ capable individuals. I hope that you can enter the Imperial Academy (国子监[3]The Guozijian,[1] sometimes translated as the Imperial College, Imperial Academy, Imperial University, National Academy, or National University,[2] was the … Continue reading) and assist me in selecting talented individuals. Are you willing?”
“The Imperial Academy?” Xu Miaojin was even more astonished.
Ma Enhui quickly said, “Your Majesty, the Imperial Academy is a place for the Emperor’s disciples, a crucial institution of the state. Miaojin is still young and her knowledge is limited. Moreover, she is a woman. How can she be sent to the Imperial Academy for official duties? It would be better to summon the Chief of the Imperial Academy and have him assess their qualifications.”
Zhu Yunwen did not respond to Ma Enhui but simply looked at Xu Miaojin, a faint smile on his lips.
Xu Miaojin, feeling a bit excited, looked at Zhu Yunwen. It was an unprecedented event for a female official to enter the Imperial Academy. She bowed and said, “I am willing.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded earnestly and said, “What I desire are individuals with true talent and learning. If you handle this well, I will allow you to establish a school for women outside of the Imperial Academy.”
“What?!” Xu Miaojin exclaimed in surprise as she looked at Zhu Yunwen.
“A woman without talent is a virtue” is a true portrayal of ancient women. In Chinese history, the protagonists are always men.
Women were confined to their homes, with limited opportunities, serving as a tool of the ruling class. No one has ever cared about women’s right to education and development.
Zhu Yunwen intends to set a precedent for this!
Chairman Mao taught us that women can hold up half the sky!
Although nowadays, advocating for equality, freedom of speech, and similar ideas will draw criticism from the censors, the Ministry of Rites, and countless others, can’t we at least promote education?
Xu Miaojin knelt down slowly, looked at Zhu Yunwen solemnly, and said, “Is what Your Majesty said true?”
She was an intelligent person and understood the significance of a women’s school! If she were not Xu Da’s daughter, if she were not favored by her elder brothers, Xu Miaojin would be confined to the courtyard, reading books and playing the zither, without any other options. And for many other women, they dare not even step outside their homes.
Forget about attending school like boys, they would only learn female crafts within their homes. They were marginalized and their opinions held no weight.
The Four Books and Five Classics, the knowledge of the world? Men would say, ‘What’s the use of learning?’ Women were not allowed to hold official positions!
This sense of discontent remained in Xu Miaojin’s heart, but she never thought it could be changed.
“If you cannot achieve it and bring in talented individuals, the door to the women’s school will be forever closed under your watch!” Zhu Yunwen said solemnly.
Xu Miaojin felt the immense pressure on her shoulders, but she remained steadfast and said, “I will definitely achieve it!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Issue the imperial decree, appoint Xu Miaojin as the Chief of Education(学正) at the National Academy, in charge of discipline and overseeing the students.”
“As you command,” the eunuch on the side shouted.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, signaling Xu Miaojin to stand up, and he said to the eunuch, “Inform the Imperial Academy’s Chief Scholar(祭酒[4]TL’s note: The Highest position in Imperial Academy), Cheng Shizhou, and the Registrar(司业), Zhang Zhi, that I have made a decision on this matter. They should not cause any further trouble.”
After speaking, Zhu Yunwen walked into Chang’an Palace in a good mood and looked at the child sleeping peacefully on the bed. This was his son Zhu Wenkui, he was two years old.
Marquis Ma’enhui watched Zhu Yunwen’s face filled with happiness as he sat down beside him and sighed, “Your Majesty, today’s arrangements may bring some controversies”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curled up slightly, and he said boldly, “These controversies are nothing. If necessary, we can have a public debate.”, “
“A debate?” Ma Enhui blinked, unsure of how Zhu Yunwen could win in debate against those learned scholars who were skilled in quoting classics.
“Your Majesty, Xu Huizu requests an audience,” a eunuch reported.
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “It seems that the excitement in the training ground has ended. Let him come to the Wu Ying Hall (武英殿, Hall of Martial Valor)[5]Hall of Martial Valor was the place where emperors went on a fast and receive ministers. It is also one of the studios for the Ming dynasty court painters..”

Chapter 4: Expanding the Army? No, I Want to Reduce it by 100,000
Wu Ying Hall.
Xu Huizu entered the hall, performed a respectful salute, and respectfully said to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, Prince Gaoyang has won a golden sword.”
Prince Gaoyang, Zhu Gaoxu.
The second son of Zhu Di.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “It seems that my fourth uncle’s son is indeed formidable, inheriting the excellence of his father. However, is it not beneath your dignity to personally come to the palace just for a martial arts competition?”
Xu Huizu lowered his head, hesitated for a moment, and then knelt down, solemnly saying, “Your Majesty, I have seen the Guards of King Yan, the soldiers under the control of imperial court, completely obedient to his commands. I am filled with anxiety day and night. Furthermore, I have witnessed each King of Yan’s son have exceptional skills, especially Zhu Gaoxu, who excels in warfare.”
“I believe that when the regional Kings hold significant military power outside the capital, it becomes difficult for the imperial decrees to reach every corner of the empire, which is detrimental to the court. I earnestly implore Your Majesty to implement the policy of reducing the power of the regional kings to restore peace to the empire.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu with a slight frown.
It seems that the news of summoning King Yan to the capital yesterday made Xu Huizu mistakenly believe that it was an attempt to keep the King in the capital and reduce his power.
That’s why he came here in advance to request reducing the power of vassal kings(削藩).
First, it allows him to express his loyalty and clarify that “I, Xu Huizhu, am a loyal follower of your reign, Jianwen Emperor. Please trust me.”
Second, it helps to strengthen their relationship and demonstrate their stance.
After all, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng have continuously advocated for the reduction of feudal powers. Although this matter is kept confidential, it is difficult to bypass the Five Army Command Headquarters.
“Reduce the power of the vassal kings? Haha, why should i do that?”
Zhu Yunwen stood up, looked at Xu Huizhu’s surprised face, and said, “You’re overthinking it. My uncles can still be trusted.”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen in disbelief, unsure if he had changed his mind or if he was distrusting him.
Understanding Xu Huizu’s thoughts, Zhu Yunwen kindly said, “The prosperity of the empire lies in the prosperity of the people and the peace of the nation. Uncles have defended the borders and made significant contributions.”
Xu Huizu was somewhat perplexed.
Zhu Yunwen explained, “Let’s set aside the matter of reducing the power of the vassal kings for now. I intend to implement a new military policy, and I wanted to hear your thoughts on it.”
“A new military policy?”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen and quickly responded, “As long as Your Majesty commands, I dare not disobey.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and asked, “How many elite troops are currently in the capital garrison?”
Xu Huizu promptly reported, “There are currently 500,000 elite troops in the capital garrison, Your Majesty. If your majesty intend to expand the military, I suggest mobilizing troops from Guangdong, Guangxi, and the northwest. The soldiers there are skilled and brave, and they can be of great use!”
Xu Huizu’s idea was simple. If Zhu Yunwen did not plan to reduce the power of vassal kings, then strengthening the central government’s military power would be necessary. By having a strong military force, they could overpower any threat posed by the regional kings, weakening their influence.
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly, surprised at the size of the current garrison of 500,000 troops. During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the military development was considered, and the “Inner and Outer Garrison” system was implemented, with 48 divisions of troops. Each division consisted of 5,600 soldiers, amounting to nearly 300,000 troops at that time. However, over time, by the beginning of the Jianwen era, the size of the capital garrison had already reached 500,000 troops, and the northern vassal kings also commanded more than 300,000 troops.
“How about reducing the military by 100,000?” Zhu Yunwen asked solemnly.
Xu Huizhu quickly said, “Deploying 100,000 elite troops to defend… eh? Reducing the military?”
Xu Huizhu, who thought they would be discussing troop deployment, was suddenly taken aback.
How could they weaken their own strength without strengthening it?
How would they respond if the vassal kings showed any signs of defiance?
Zhu Yunwen was not joking; instead, he spoke with utmost seriousness: “You know better than anyone about the state of the military. What we need is not the old, weak, sick, or a bunch of servants or lackeys. Nor do we need a group of pampered soldiers. What we need is an army capable of fighting!”
The issue of corruption within the military had always been a chronic problem throughout various dynasties.
Just because you hold a spear, does that mean you’re an elite soldier? Look at your age, you’re practically buried in the yellow soil up to your neck.
Just because you have a registered name, does that make you a true soldier? Who doesn’t know that you’re the servant of some influential figure or the retainer of a military general?
A group of individuals who rarely engage in training, how dare they call themselves elite?
Xu Huizhu broke out in a cold sweat, suddenly understanding that quality mattered more than quantity when it came to the military.
“You have one month to rectify the army. After one month, I will personally inspect them! Make sure to create some noise and make it noticeable.”
Zhu Yunwen issued the order.
After leaving the Wuying Hall, Xu Huizhu returned to the Five Army Commandery’s office, still in a state of uncertainty. He summoned his two younger brothers, Xu Yingxu, the Deputy Commander[1]“佥事” was used to refer to a mid-level administrative officer who assisted in the management and governance of local affairs. of the Central Army, and Xu Zengshou, the Left Commander of the Right Army Commandery, and informed them about the plan to reduce the army by 100,000 soldiers.
Both of them were taken aback and caught off guard by the news.
Xu Huizhu calmly observed his two brothers as they processed this astonishing information and sighed, remarking, “The Emperor’s move is truly remarkable.”
Perplexed, Xu Yingxu asked, “Elder brother, what do you mean?”
Taking a sip of tea to calm his nerves, Xu Huizhu explained, “The Emperor’s actions serve three purposes. First, it is to reorganize the army. Second, it is to discipline the influential and noble generals. And third, it is to convey to the regional kings that the Emperor has no intention of interfering with them and hopes they will maintain stability in their fiefdoms.”
“Perhaps the Emperor has another layer of intention.”
Gazing at his brothers, Xu Zengshou spoke slowly, “By informing the regional kings that the Emperor is capable of taking action against the army in the capital, he is also implying that if he were to take action against the border armies under their control, it would be within reason. At that point, even if the border princes oppose, they would have no grounds to resist.”
Impressed, Xu Huizhu glanced at Xu Zengshou and agreed, “The Emperor’s intentions are hard to decipher now, but reducing the army by 100,000 is an inevitable move. However, it is a risky move that will surely offend many.”
In times of peace, the generals, nobles, powerful figures, and influential families all sought to accumulate wealth. The meager salaries established by Zhu Yuanzhang long ago would have left them starving.
For these individuals, the best way to amass wealth was through military salaries.
By reducing the army by 100,000, it was not necessarily reducing the actual number of soldiers by that amount but rather removing those who were embezzling salaries or fraudulently collecting military funds.
According to Xu Huizhu’s estimation, the actual number of soldiers to be cut would probably not exceed 50,000.
“Brother, there is another troublesome matter…”
Xu Zengshou looked at Xu Huizhu and massaged his temples.
“What is it?”
Xu Huizhu had a bad feeling about this.
Sighing, Xu Zengshou replied, “This morning, Miaojin entered the palace to accompany the empress and was appointed as Chief of Education of the Imperial Academy. The court is now in shock, and some officials are preparing to impeach…”
Xu Huizhu felt his vision darken and a sense of dizziness overwhelmed him. “What? Miao Jin? How could she enter the Imperial Academy? How could she become Chief of Education?”
The Imperial Academy was a prestigious institution, a gathering place for scholars from all over the country. Many officials had graduated from the Imperial Academy. Not to mention that these scholars were stubborn and unruly, always spouting lofty ideals of benevolence, righteousness, and the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues[2]In Confucianism, the Sangang Wuchang (Chinese: 三綱五常; pinyin: Sāngāng Wǔcháng), sometimes translated as the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant … Continue reading. How could they possibly accept a woman?
What kind of move was the Emperor making? Wasn’t he just asking for trouble?
The court officials were always looking for something to complain about. They were idle during the period of national mourning, so upon hearing that a woman had entered the Imperial Academy, they would surely jump at the opportunity to criticize and submit petitions.

Chapter 5: Fang Xiao Ru the Everlasting Loyal Minister
The imperial censor Gao Xiang splashed ink, citing ancient texts and references.
From the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Ancestor of the Ming Dynasty, thousands of words have been scattered and filled with grief and anger. Gao Xiang said bluntly: “Women ought to stay at home and do embroidery, why should they degrade themselves to the court? We are all men of valor, and we will not disgrace the Four books and Five Classics[1]The Four Books and Five Classics (Chinese: 四書五經; pinyin: Sìshū Wǔjīng) are the authoritative books of Confucianism, written in China before 300 … Continue reading even if we die !”
One after another, the memorials were sent directly to Wu Ying Hall.
It wasn’t just the imperial censors who voiced their opinions; officials from the six ministries were also unwilling to remain silent and wrote memorials to impeach.
Some people even aimed their accusations directly at Xu Huizu, the Duke of Wei, and labeled him as “meddling in the affairs of the Harem, without a sense of shame”.
Even the obscure astronomical bureau also made a fuss, saying, “unexpected celestial phenomena during the night observations.”
Zhu Yunwen sat in the Wuying hall, relishing the content of these memorials.
These officials were certainly not lacking in talent, Their words were eloquent, their rhetoric well-structured, and their language flowed smoothly, all while refraining from using vulgar language to insult others.
“Say, is a woman entering the Imperial Academy enough to frighten the entire court of civil officials? Are women so terrifying?”
Zhu Yunwen said to Ma Enhui, who was holding the child beside him.
Ma Enhui chuckled and said: “Your Majesty, I already expressed my concerns beforehand. You know it’s inappropriate, so why did you still proceed in this manner? It’s only natural that the officials oppose it.”
Zhu Yunwen beckoned, and said to the eunuch, Shuangxi, next to him: “Return these memorials to the ones who wrote them. You will ask them a few questions on my behalf.”
Shuangxi asked, “What question does your majesty want me to ask them?”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “Just ask them, is their mother literate? No, it should be, does your mother know how to read? Does your wife know how to read? Does your daughter know how to read? Are they willing to learn?”
Shuangxi opened his mouth and looked at Ma Enhui’s difficulty. Ma Enhui remained silent and lowered her head, so Shuangxi had no choice but to agree, prepared to leave with the memorials.
“wait.”
Zhu Yunwen stopped Shuang Xi and instructed: “Go with them to their homes. Let them ask their own mothers and wives, take notes, and give me a reply.”
Shuangxi agreed and quickly made the arrangements.
Ma Enhui suddenly laughed, looked at Zhu Yunwen, and said, “Your Majesty, this move of yours has a bit of spirit of a bandit.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily.
Dealing with this group of stubborn people, reasoning with them directly wouldn’t work
“The Analects[2]The Analects (Chinese: 論語; pinyin: Lúnyǔ; Old Chinese: [r]u[n] ŋ(r)aʔ; meaning “Selected Sayings”), also known as the Analects of … Continue reading” also states that a gentleman should prioritize the fundamentals, for it is from the establishment of the fundamentals that virtue arises. Filial piety and fraternal respect are the foundations of benevolence.
Since you scholars emphasize filial piety and fraternal respect, you cannot disregard the words of your own mothers, right?
Send them off to reflect on their intentions only then we can discuss the matter of Xu Miaojin.
“Report to the Emperor, Hanlin Lecturer Fang Xiaoru seeks an audience.”
The eunuch reported.
Zhu Yunwen agreed, and a thin man of about forty years old, wearing a ninth-grade green official robe with a round collar walked in.
This was none other than Fang Xiaoru who had his “ten generations[3]TL’s note: In addition to his own execution, his blood relations and their spouses were killed, along with all of his students and peers as the 10th group.)” executed by Zhu Di!



If … Continue reading was hailed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the “foremost founding civil official.”
According to reason, since Zhu Yuanzhang valued Fang Xiaoru and summoned him twice, his official career should have been prosperous. However, Zhu Yuanzhang chose not to employ Fang Xiaoru himself but instead passed him on to his son. After his son’s death, the position was again inherited by his grandson, who is the current Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen sighed heavily. If history were to unfold as it did, when Zhu Di invaded the capital, Fang Xiaoru would have met his demise along with more than eight hundred others. It is undeniable that he was a loyal minister, an eternal loyal minister at that! When faced with Zhu Di’s slaughter, his indomitable spirit and righteousness were unmatched by anyone.
His belief was encapsulated in the phrase “To sacrifice oneself for righteousness, rather than seeking to preserve one’s life at the expense of righteousness.” It was the belief of a scholar. He chose death over submission, death over serving two masters.
However, his abilities did not match his position. Zhu Yunwen’s failure in the struggle against Zhu Di can be attributed to this mismatch. He bears a great responsibility for his “loyal advice.”
After granting a seat to Fang Xiaoru, Zhu Yunwen looked at him. Although Fang Xiaoru had a pale complexion, his eyes were bright and determined. Zhu Yunwen asked, “Mr. Fang, are you here for the matter of Chief Xu?”
Upon hearing this, Fang Xiaoru smiled lightly and said, “The ‘Rites of Zhou[4]The Rites of Zhou (Chinese: 周禮), originally known as “Officers of Zhou” (周官; Zhouguan) is a Chinese work on bureaucracy and organizational theory.’ have long mentioned the role of female officials. Although they serve within the inner court, considering Chief Xu’s position, it is only about selecting talents for Your Majesty. As long as Chief Xu conducts himself with integrity and adheres to proper etiquette, there should be no issue.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Yunwen was somewhat surprised.
He thought Fang Xiaoru was a rigid bookworm, but he didn’t expect him to know how to be flexible.
“This Subject came here not to speak about Chief Xu, but to discuss the governance through culture.” Fang Xiaoru said seriously.
“Go on.” Zhu Yunwen signaled.
Fang Xiaoru spoke confidently: “Having resided in a remote place for a long time and now being in the capital, I have received Your Majesty’s gracious favor and taken up the position of Hanlin attendant lecturer. I have witnessed Your Majesty’s emphasis on Confucianism and literary pursuits, with the intention of governance through culture. And in my opinion, if we are to pursue governance through culture, we should uphold the principles of ‘Courtesy’.”
“What do you mean Mr.Fang?” Zhu Yunwen frowned.
Fang Xiaoru spoke frankly, “Is Your Majesty summoning the King of Yan to the capital with the intention of reducing his power?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Fang Xiaoru without saying anything.
Fang Xiaoru continued, “I earnestly implore Your Majesty not to do so. Although the King of Yan is the leader of the northern fiefs, he has committed no wrongs. If he is summoned to the capital and his power is forcefully reduced, it would be a breach of etiquette. Moreover, it has only been a little over a month since the passing of the founding emperor, and if Your Majesty were to take action against the King of Yan, it may chill the hearts of the people.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and smiled, “Mr. Fang, you worry too much. I am summoning the King of Yan to the capital as a means to rectify past mistakes. Our dynasty upholds the principles of benevolence and filial piety. If the royal family cannot uphold these principles, how can we set an example for the people?”
“Is that so?”
“Indeed. To alleviate the concerns of the King of Yan, I have also issued orders to reduce the military by 100,000 troops, to demonstrate that we have no intention of reducing the vassal king’s power. At the same time, these troops will be used for civilian purposes, opening up new lands in the southern mountains. Isn’t that even better?”
“Your Majesty is wise and enlightened.”
Fang Xiaoru expressed his joy and prostrated himself.
After sending away Fang Xiaoru, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng arrived.
Upon hearing the news of reducing the military by 100,000 troops, they became even more fearful and anxious, hastily submitting their petitions. However, Zhu Yunwen ignored their memorial, leaving it aside.
Seeing no response, the two of them sought an audience directly.
“Your Majesty, it is absolutely crucial not to reduce the military at this time…”
“Please reconsider your decree…”
The two of them pleaded back and forth, causing Zhu Yunwen to feel distressed.
In the end, there seemed to be no solution.
After praising Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng for their unwavering loyalty, Zhu Yunwen assured them that it would not affect the military’s combat capabilities. Even if there were reductions, troops could be relocated from the border regions to maintain stability. This reassured the two officials.
Once they left, Zhu Yunwen picked up a memorial written by the Right Vice Minister of Justice, Yuan Tai. In it, there was a sentence that criticized Xie Jin for coming to the capital before the mourning period for his mother had ended and when his father was ninety years old, stating that it was inappropriate.
This is an attack on Xie Jin who came to the capital to mourn.
It was because of this memorial by this old bro, Xie Jin, one of the three great talents of the Ming Dynasty and later the compiler of the “Yongle Encyclopedia[5]The Yongle Encyclopedia (English: /jɒŋlə/) or Yongle Dadian (traditional Chinese: 永樂大典; simplified Chinese: 永乐大典; pinyin: Yǒnglè … Continue reading,” was sent to Gansu to suffer hardships.
A smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth as he softly said, “Xie Jin, should I have you compile a “Jianwen Encyclopedia” for me? Hehe. Guards, summon Xie Jin to the palace.”

Chapter 6: Top Student Xie Jin Answering the Emperor
The name of Xie Jin, will not disappear from history.
He was a rare genius in the Ming dynasty. It can even be said that he played a very crucial role in the direction of the Ming Dynasty.
If it weren’t for Xie Jin’s remark of “Good Holy Grandson”, it would be difficult to predict who will be the Ming dynasty’s future emperor.
Zhu Yunwen couldn’t help shaking his head when he recalled Xie Jin’s “Top Student” journey.
Xie Jin recited a poem at the age of 5, wrote an essay at the age of 7, read thoroughly “four books and five classics” at the age of 12, become first placed candidate in the provincial imperial exam at the age of 18, At nineteen he placed tenth in the 3rd Rank of the 5th Year Presented Scholar exam. he was granted the treatment same as a Scholar, and the title of “all good men of virtue”.
Zhu Yuanzhang appreciated Xie Jin’s talent, and appointed him as an advisor in the imperial court, promoting him to the position of Hanlin Academician.
At the age of nineteen, he had already reached the height that countless people admired.
Upon careful consideration of future generations, at the age of nineteen, one is typically still studying.
However, it is not necessarily a good thing to hold a high position at a young age, lack of social experience can lead to arrogance and conceit, Xie Jin, being too idealistic, ultimately paid a price.
In just a couple of years, he didn’t rise in rank but managed to offend quite a few people.
Today he criticizes an official for neglecting their duties, tomorrow he points out the negligence of the Ministry of War, and the day after tomorrow he writes a memorial to challenge the authority of the great boss, Zhu Yuanzhang.
As a result, Xie Jin became alienated and isolated.
When the minister of war, Shen Qian, accused Xie Jin, not a single person stood up to speak for him. Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice but to dismiss Xie Jin and sent him to conduct inspection in Jiangxi.
After being driven out of the capital city, Xie Jin, still trying to make a fuss, and was ordered by Zhu Yuanzhang to ‘stay at home and focus on studying’.
Zhu Yuanzhang left a remark for Xie Jin’s father, saying, “It is not too late to make great use of him in the next ten years.” This implied that Zhu Yuanzhang wanted Xie Jin to return to his duties after ten years.
However, seven years later, Zhu Yuanzhang passed away. Xie Jin clearly didn’t want to wait for a “ten-year period”. Upon hearing the news, he immediately used the excuse of mourning and hurried to the capital, preparing for a comeback.
And so, the present meeting took place.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin with interest. Xie Jin was short and thin, with an unremarkable appearance.
“Xie Jin, humbly paying respect to your majesty.” Xie Jin knelt down and respectfully greeted.
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly and waved his hand, saying: “have a seat”
Xie Jin sat on the chair but barely touched its edge.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t seem bothered and took out Yuan Tai’s impeachment memorial, instructing someone to hand it to Xie Jin.
“After you have read it, you may respond.”
Xie Jin quickly took the memorial, opened it, and his expression turned fearful. He immediately knelt down and exclaimed,:” I am guilty.”
Zhu Yunwen asked, “Guilty of what?”
Xie Jin’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he hurriedly replied, “I should not have left home while my mother’s funeral rites were unfinished. It was unfilial of me.”
“Knowing it was unfilial, why did you come to the capital?” Zhu Yunwen asked, understanding the situation.
In ancient times, filial piety was highly esteemed. If you held an official position in the court and your parents passed away, regardless of your rank, you were required to resign from your official duties and return home to observe mourning for twenty-seven months, starting from the day you received the news of the bereavement.
There was a specific term for this: “dingyou (丁忧).”
In general, the imperial court does not allow the forced appointment of individuals in mourning as officials.
If it is deemed necessary under special circumstances to forcefully appoint someone in mourning as an official, it is called “duoqing (夺情).
The term “duoqing(夺情)” is rarely used, but once employed, it will inevitably face fierce criticism from the civil officials.
For example, Zhang Juzheng, the most powerful Senior Grand Secretary of Ming Dynasty, was labeled as “unfilial” due to his appointment during mourning. Even after his death, Emperor Wanli held onto this matter, harboring deep resentment towards Zhang Juzheng.
Xie Jin quickly kowtowed and exclaimed,: “Your majesty, I came to the capital to mourn, also driven by filial piety.”
“oh?”
Upon hearing this, Zhu Yunwen looked intently at Xie Jin and his words.
Xie Jin continued to plead, “Your Majesty, this humble subject’s journey to the capital during mourning is also an expression of filial piety. Emperor Taizu treated me as a loyal subject, but his favor was akin to that of a father. My act of mourning for my father is a clear manifestation of filial devotion.”
A faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth.
Indeed, Zhu Yuanzhang had once regarded Jie Jin as a father and son when they dined together in the Dapao (大庖)[1]Dapao refers to Kitchen in the imperial palace during the Ming dynasty. It was one of the several kitchens in the palace complex responsible for preparing meals for the emperor, his family, and the … Continue reading West Chamber, encouraging Jie Jin to speak candidly and express his opinions freely.
It was from this moment that the famous ten-thousand-word memorial, “Memorial of Dapao West Chamber,” came to be in history.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin appreciatively, nodding slightly, and said, “Taizu valued you greatly. Now that I have just taken power, I need capable individuals. Xie Jin, enter the Hanlin Academy and become a Hanlin attendant lecturer.”
Xie Jin was overjoyed and quickly expressed his gratitude, saying, “Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen nodded and said, “Rise.”
Suppressing his excitement, Xie Jin stood up.
The Hanlin Academy was a prestigious institution composed of scholars and intellectuals who served as advisers and aides to the emperor. The highest-ranking official in the Imperial Academy was the Academician whose authority was nearly equivalent to that of the Prime Minister.
Entering the Hanlin Academy signifies stepping into the center of imperial power.
“What is your opinion on the current state of the court?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Reflecting for a moment, Xie Jin spoke with lowered hands, “Your Majesty, in my humble opinion, it is crucial to stabilize the court internally by consolidating the official’s support. Externally, it is necessary to reduce the power of regional kings and centralize military authority.”
Zhu Yunwen glanced at Xie Jin, and asked, “More specific.”
Xie Jin solemnly responded, “During the reign of Emperor Taizu, there was strict discipline, and the officials lived in fear and anxiety. Even the ministers of the Six Ministries were anxious. Your Majesty, the officials have long yearned for your benevolence. If Your Majesty implements a policy of leniency, rectifying the existing malpractices, you will surely win the hearts of the people. Once the hearts of the people are aligned, the court will be as stable as Mount Tai.”
“As for external affairs, Emperor Taizu appointed the nine powerful border kings, granting them significant military power. However, their authority is not based solely on military might, but rather on the system of feudal enfeoffment. Overcoming this predicament is not a difficult task.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the confident Xie Jin and asked, “How can we overcome this predicament?”
Xie Jin’s said frankly: ”Relocate the vassal kings, steadily reduce their power.”
Zhu Yunwen fell into deep thought,
Xie Jin spoke from the side: “I have heard that the King of Gu, King of Liao, and King of Su have repeatedly petitioned for relocation of their fiefs, but they were rejected by Emperor Taizu. Now that Your Majesty holds the reins of power, you can bestow favor upon the border Kings by selecting suitable locations for their fiefdoms. This will serve as an example for the other border Kings.”
Zhu Yunwen nods slightly, indicating approval of this option.
In fact, the border king’s armies are all under the control of the imperial court, despite being under the jurisdiction and command of the border kings themselves. Their purpose is solely to defend against the Mongols and safeguard the frontier.
If they are relocated internally, they would lose their military authority and naturally pose no threat. However, some individuals cant be resolved by simply changing their location.
For example, the King of Ning and the King of Qin, who have a large number of troops and capable generals, as well as the Prince of Yan, known for his military prowess.
Without waiting for Zhu Yunwen to ask, Xie Jin spoke frankly, “Among the nine border Kings, in terms of military strength and numbers, the most prominent ones are the King of Ning, the King of Qin, and the King of Yan. However, the King of Qin passed away early, and his successor is just a child, so he can hardly be considered a threat. The Prince of Ning commands 80,000 elite troops, but he is situated outside the borders. If he loses the supply and support from the imperial court, his survival will be difficult.”
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly, not entirely convinced with Xie Jin’s theoretical analysis.
Although the Prince of Ning is located outside the borders and heavily relies on logistical support from the imperial court, if there is a failure in a timely blockade, the King of Ning could lead his troops to capture the strategic city of Datong, directly confronting Beiping Prefecture.
In history, Zhu Di (later Emperor Yongle) took advantage of King of Ning and brought his forces to Beiping, thereby strengthening his power.
Xie Jin only focused attention on Zhu Di, the King of Yan, stating that Zhu Di was the “foremost among the Kings,” making him difficult to handle. Xie Jin proposed a strategy of prioritizing benevolence and governance before resorting to military force.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and appreciated Xie Jin’s perspective, encouraging him to serve the court diligently.
After Xie Jin left, Zhu Yunwen remained silent for a long time. Finally, he sighed and said, “their perspectives are still somewhat narrow. It seems that it’s time to establish the Grand Secretariat[2]The Grand Secretariat (Chinese: 內閣; pinyin: Nèigé) was nominally a coordinating agency but de facto the highest institution in the imperial government of the Chinese Ming dynasty. It … Continue reading.”

Chapter 7: The Starting Point of Care, People Around Us
With a cheerful smile, Shuangxi entered the palace and approached the entrance of the Wuying Hall. He rubbed his face and walked inside cautiously. He respectfully reported, “Your Majesty, those ministers have all become more restrained.”
Indeed.
A mother is unable to read or have knowledge, how can she teach her children to read and understand?
A wife desires to appreciate poetry, literature, and art, but cannot read, how can she cultivate elegance?
A daughter also wishes to attend school, why should only boys have the privilege of reading?
It is unfair.
Although no one directly mentions breaking the “Three Obediences and Four Virtues” or the “Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues,” the inner desire for education is a reality that can’t be ignored.
Zhu Yunwen does not care about these disturbances. Even the Imperial Academy did not say anything. The commotion caused by these people is nothing more than a waste of paper, ink, and saliva.
The news of the disarmament of 100,000 troops finally stirred up a sensation within the imperial capital.
No one expected that the new emperor would possess such determination and means to easily disband one hundred thousand troops with a wave of his hand. Throughout history, it is more common to hear of emperors expanding their armies rather than demobilizing them.
As a result, the civil officials believed that an era of “civil governance” was about to begin, and they eagerly presented memorials praising the emperor as a wise ruler. As for minor matters like Xu Miaojin, not many people paid much attention to them.
Yù Xīn, the Minister of Revenue, smiled and said to Xia Yuánjí, an official in the Ministry of Revenue, “The emperor’s actions are truly remarkable.”
Xia Yuánjí nodded and said, “Yù-dàrén, it seems that the Ministry of Revenue will save a considerable amount of funds and provisions this year.”
Yù Xīn took a relaxed sip of tea and said with relief, “Indeed. Cavalry soldiers consume two dan of grain per month, while ordinary soldiers consume one dan. And that’s just the ration expenses. The capital city alone incurs heavy costs. By reducing one hundred thousand troops, we can save 3.6 million shi of grain annually. Now that summer has arrived, there are frequent rainstorms, repairs needed for river embankments, and disaster relief efforts—all of which require funds and provisions.” [1]TL’s note: 1 dan during the Ming dynasty is 141,7 catty, 1 catty is 500 gram. They are talking about soldier’s salary here.
“The matters of the Ministry of Revenue are indeed challenging.” Xia Yuánjí joked.
Yù Xīn chuckled and said, “Wéi Zhé, you have to bear more responsibilities. The affairs of the Ministry of Revenue will require your extra effort.”
Xia Yuan Ji, courtesy name Wei Zhe.
Xia Yuanji nodded solemnly and looked at the somewhat aged Yù Xīn. He slowly said, “Is the disarmament of the troops related to the summoning of the King of Yan to the capital?”
A gleam flashed in Yù Xīn’s eyes, and he chuckled, “Our Emperor is indeed extraordinary. Have you heard? Xie Jīn has already entered the Hanlin Academy.”
“Yes, I’ve heard. Xie Jīn, during the time of Emperor Taizu, though arrogant and frivolous, was truly a person of integrity. It’s good to have someone like him by the Emperor’s side.” Xia Yuanji praised.
 Yu Xin stood up and walked up to Xia Yuanji, saying, “It’s strange indeed. When His Majesty was the Crown Prince, Qi Tai, and Huang Zicheng were his associates in the Eastern Palace. But now, despite His Majesty’s reign, Qi Tai remains the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War, and Huang Zicheng is still a Compiler in the Hanlin Academy. This is quite unusual.”
For a newly enthroned emperor, the first officials to be appointed are often those close to him. However, even though Emperor Taizu has been resting in the Mausoleum for some time, the new emperor hasn’t bestowed favor on his old comrades. Surprisingly the first person to be promoted is none other than Xie Jin, who has been away from the court for many years.
“Perhaps his majesty has other plans in mind.” Xia Yuanji calmly said.
Zhu Yunwen remains secluded in the deep palace and does not attend court.
In the court, the officials look anxiously, searching left and right, but Zhu Yunwen is nowhere to be seen.
Memorials after memorials are submitted, yet no one grant approval. How can they handle affairs?
Does the Ming Dynasty still have any function left?
Some lower-ranking officials even speculate whether the emperor, due to excessive worries over the passing of the previous emperor, has fallen ill. They inquire around, hoping to submit memorials to express their loyalty.
Zhu Yunwen walks out of the Wuying Hall, observing the sun slowly setting, casting darkness upon the majestic palace. If it weren’t for the clear memories from the future, Zhu Yunwen would have forgotten where he came from.
“Shuangxi, do you miss your family?”
Zhu Yunwen gently asked.
Eunuch Shuangxi looked at him in astonishment. During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the treatment of eunuchs was extremely harsh, with severe punishments for even minor mistakes, ranging from leg-breaking to death. Even after Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne, this strictness continued.
The current display of care and inquiry was almost unimaginable.
Indeed, historically, Zhu Yunwen did not consider eunuchs as individuals.
During Zhu Di’s rebellion, many eunuchs became spies for Zhu Di because he treated them as individuals and trusted them.
The notorious ‘Eastern Depot[2]Eastern Depot or Eastern Bureau (traditional Chinese: 東廠; simplified Chinese: 东厂; pinyin: Dōng Chǎng; Wade–Giles: Tung Ch’ang) was … Continue reading’, an institution led by eunuchs, which gained great fame in later generations, is a testament to Zhu Di’s trust in eunuchs.
Moved by his words, Shuangxi felt like crying and quickly replied, “Your Majesty, I occasionally think of them, but unfortunately, I have no chance to see them again.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and said, “Why can’t you see them?”
Shuangxi respectfully replied, “As I entered the palace, I became Your Majesty’s subject. How could I see them again? Besides, even if I were to return, they would not recognize me.”
Shuangxi’s words were accurate.
In ancient times, importance was placed on lineage and family inheritance.
An eunuch was not qualified to enter the ancestral shrine and was often looked down upon at, at least during the early Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the desolate Shuangxi and asked, “Is it the same for everyone in the harem?”
“Naturally,” Shuangxi quickly replied.
As Zhu Yunwen walked, he noticed a palace maid kneeling by the side of the road, carrying a food container. He stopped and asked, “Where are you from?”
The palace maid replied with fear and respect, “Your Majesty, this humble servant is from Suzhou.”
“Suzhou, ah! I have been there. Do you know the Lion Grove Garden[3]The Lion Grove Garden (simplified Chinese: 狮子林园; traditional Chinese: 獅子林園; pinyin: Shī Zǐ Lín Yuán; Suzhou Wu: Sy tsy lin yoe, Wu … Continue reading?” Zhu Yunwen recalled his visit to the Lion Grove Garden in later years and asked with a smile.
The palace maid shook her head.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “What a pity. However, the Lion Grove Garden might not have been established yet. How long has it been since you last saw your parents and family?”
“It has been three years, Your Majesty,” the palace maid replied softly.
Zhu Yunwen rubbed his temples and said to Shuangxi, “Go and have Kunji summoned.”
Shuangxi signaled to a eunuch next to him.
Zhu Yunwen opened the food box carried by the palace maid and glanced inside. There were only some light dishes. He asked, “Who is this for?”
The palace maid hurriedly replied, “It’s for the Consort Ning.”
Zhu Yunwen narrowed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and then remembered the consort. He said to the palace maid, “Such light dishes are not suitable. Come with me, we’ll go to the Imperial Kitchen.”
The palace maid couldn’t go against the Emperor’s command.
Shuangxi followed along, puzzled by the situation.
In the Imperial Kitchen, which was responsible for the Emperor’s and the palace’s meals and banquets, the Chief of the Imperial Kitchen, Liu Yizheng, was humming a tune, leisurely sipping wine. He would give a few orders when there was nothing else to do, but overall, he led a comfortable life.
However, when Liu Yizheng saw Zhu Yunwen approaching while he had the wine jug at his mouth, he was dumbfounded and froze in place for a moment.
Shuangxi quickly gave a signal from the side, and Liu Yizheng immediately knelt down, bowing and apologizing.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t even spare a glance at Liu Yizheng. He looked at the numerous ingredients in the kitchen and pondered. He realized that he was only skilled in a few home-cooked dishes.
However, he wondered if the emperor was cooking, would invite criticism from officials?
Whatever.
Kung Pao Chicken [4]Kung Pao chicken (Chinese: 宫保鸡丁; pinyin: Gōngbǎo jīdīng; Wade–Giles: Kung¹-pao³ Chi¹-ting¹), also transcribed Gong Bao or Kung Po, … Continue reading, Yuxiang shredded pork[5]Yuxiang shredded pork (simplified Chinese: 鱼香肉丝; traditional Chinese: 魚香肉絲; pinyin: yúxiāng ròusī; sometimes translated as fish-flavored pork … Continue reading didn’t exist in the Ming dynasty era, those dishes had to wait until the Republican era. The Shangshan Bureau certainly wouldn’t have learned them. If I don’t take matters into my own hands, even eating becomes a problem…
During the period of mourning, indulging in extravagant seafood and meat is not allowed. But if I cook the dish and just pick out the meat, wouldn’t that solve the problem…

Chapter 8: Yu Xiang Shredded pork benefits the lower class
Shuangxi clung to Zhu Yunwen’s legs, crying out and pleading for him not to cook. he even said, “A nobleman should stay away from the kitchen” he had never seen an emperor cook before.
He was tossed aside by Zhu Yunwen.
Nonsense, do you really think I’ve never read a book?
In the “Mencius, King Hui of Liang” chapter, it says: “Regarding birds and animals, when a noble person sees them alive, they cannot bear to see them dead; when they hear their sounds, they cannot bear to eat their flesh. Therefore, noble persons keep their distance from the kitchen.”
In the “Book of Rites, Jade Carvings” there are similar words left behind: “Noble persons keep their distance from the kitchen, they do not tread upon any living beings with blood and breath.”
The original intention is to tell the king that one should have benevolence and should not advocate or engage in killing, and it has nothing to do with “being ashamed of the kitchen.”
Furthermore, what has never seen an emperor cook before?
Did Emperor Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang not personally cook when he was a beggar?
If he picked wild vegetables from the roadside, it would still require cooking, wouldn’t it?
Liu Yi kept kowtowing, blood dripping from his forehead, yet he still goes on saying that the Imperial Kitchen has let the emperor down, and as long as the emperor says a word, he will immediately find a rope to end his own life.
Just cooking a meal, why so many things to fuss about?
Zhu Yunwen became angry and ordered Shuangxi to stand aside, instructing everyone from the Imperial Kitchen to watch. Then he picked up a knife and gave a threatening glance to Shuangxi, who was about to approach. He grabbed a carrot and started chopping it.
Shuangxi was stunned.
The people from the Imperial Kitchen also widened their eyes in surprise.
The palace maid on the side had her mouth wide open, staring motionlessly.
The emperor knows how to chop vegetables?
How strange! How could the emperor possibly know how to chop vegetables, and he even cut them into thin shreds.
Wood ear mushrooms?
Chinese lettuce?
Meat?
Oh my God, the emperor actually wants to eat meat during the period of mourning?
This goes against etiquette.
If the civil officials were to find out, wouldn’t it cause a major uproar?
Shuangxi stared at the people from the Imperial Kitchen, indicating that whoever dared to leak any information would face consequences.
The people from the Imperial Kitchen had no interest in looking at Shuangxi’s gaze. They were sweating profusely, fearing that if the emperor were to cut his hand, they might lose their heads.
“Light the fire.”
Zhu Yunwen finished cutting the ingredients and put some vinegar in a bowl. He looked at the hard, yellow sugar cubes and sighed.
During the early Ming Dynasty, refined white sugar was not yet available.
White refined sugar appeared during the Jiajing emperor’s reign of the Ming Dynasty. Later, when Song Yingxing wrote ‘The Exploitation of heavenly treasures’ he specifically described the production method of refined rock sugar in a section called ‘Gan Shi’ (Sweet Cravings).
Zhu Yunwen was uncertain whether the Jiajing emperor’s reign would occur in the future, after all it was Zhu Di’s lineage.
There was also a gap of two hundred years between him and Shen Kuo[1]Shen Kuo (Chinese: 沈括; 1031–1095) or Shen Gua, courtesy name Cunzhong (存中) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given … Continue reading, It’s unreliable to expect them, to enjoy the privilege of having white sugar.
Ma Enhui hurriedly arrived at the Imperial kitchen from the Chang’an Palace. Upon entering, she happened to see Zhu Yunwen cooking and was so shocked that she almost fainted. She looked at the eunuchs, palace maids, and Shangshanjian staff standing idly by, Ma Enhui was on the verge of losing her temper.
“Don’t be angry, it was I who ordered them to stand aside,” Zhu Yunwen said.
Zhu Yunwen scooped two portions of Yuxiang Shredded pork , picked out a portion of the shredded pork, and called over the palace maid from before. He instructed her, “Take this and bring it to consort Ning.”
The palace maid expressed her thanks and carefully placed it in a food container before quickly leaving.
“My beloved consort, come and taste it.”
Zhu Yunwen motioned to Ma Enhui.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion, uncertain, and asked, “How could Your Majesty know how to do such… thing?”
Mid-sentence, she stopped herself from uttering the word “lowly.”
Zhu Yunwen picked up the chopsticks and handed them to Ma Enhui, saying, “A bowl of porridge, a meal, one should cherish the origin of its scarcity; a thread, a piece of cloth, one should always remember the toil behind its production. These days, I have been contemplating that food is of utmost importance to the people. If even our royal family doesn’t understand how to be frugal, how can we effectively guide the masses?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, gracefully bowed, and exclaimed, “A bowl of porridge, a meal, one should cherish the origin of its scarcity; a thread, a piece of cloth, one should always remember the toil behind its production. Your Majesty’s wisdom is a blessing to the people.”
“Your Majesty is wise.”
Shuangxi and the members of the Imperial kitchen quickly knelt down and echoed in unison.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Rise, everyone. Let’s refrain from extravagance and waste in the future. Unless necessary, let the breakfast and dinner be reduced from twelve courses to six, and the lunch from twenty-four courses to twelve.”
“Since Your Majesty has set an example, the meals in the harem should also be reduced accordingly.”
Ma Enhui quickly suggested.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “The Consorts and concubines should not waste, but the meals of the lower-ranking palace maids and eunuchs should be enhanced, They should not have fewer than two dishes. Let the Imperial kitchen learn this dish and distribute it to them as well.”
Ma Enhui expressed gratitude on behalf of the palace maids and eunuchs, and under Zhu Yunwen’s encouragement, she took a bite of the Yuxiang Shredded pork, Her eyes lit up, and her hands moved faster. She ate a few more bites and then looked at Zhu Yunwen with a slightly embarrassed expression. She exclaimed, “Your Majesty, for the dinner, I would like to have this dish.”
“Haha, would the beloved consort like to try learning it?”
“Can I learn it too?”
“Why not? Liu Yi, prepare the ingredients…”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and called out.
Outside the Imperial City, near the Desheng Gate(Gate of Virtuous Triumph), the Laundry Bureau.
The palace maid, Luo Yan’er, tiredly leaned against a pillar, looking up at the night sky, and sighing deeply. Her stomach grumbled and growled loudly.
It was so late, yet they weren’t allowed to eat. She heard that the female official in charge was summoned to the palace. She wondered if it was because there was an issue with the laundry she had washed or if there was some favor bestowed upon the palace.
But regardless, it had nothing to do with her.
The lowly palace maid could only live a lowly existence.
Luo Yan’er remembered her father, who was executed due to Lan Yu[2]Lan Yu (died 1393) was a Chinese military general and politician in the early Ming dynasty. His ancestral home was in present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui. In 1393, Lan Yu was … Continue reading Case, and her mother, who couldn’t bear the pain and took her own life. Their once-warm family was shattered in an instant.
Her uncle had sold her to the palace, unfortunately she had no money to bribe anyone. She had offended a eunuch in charge and was ultimately assigned to the Laundry Bureau, living a life worse than death, all for a meager meal.
That was all there was to it.
But now even meals are not to be served on time.
*Gurgle*.
Her stomach growled once again. Outside, she could hear the clamor of excitement, indicating that the palace had arranged some rewards.
“Sister Yan’er, Sister Yan’er, come quickly!”
A palace maid in her late teens emerged from a distance, calling out loudly.
Luo Yan’er felt a pang in her stomach and couldn’t get up, so she waved her hand in the direction of the maid.
The maid turned around and walked out. Not long after, she came running back with two food containers in her hands, a smile beaming on her face. She placed the food containers next to Luo Yan’er and said, “Well, this is our dinner.”
“Dinner? Qiao Hui, are you sure you didn’t make a mistake?”
Luo Yan’er looked at the food containers.
Since joining the laundry bureau, she had never used these food containers before. During meal times, there was always someone arranging the food, and they would go to a separate compartment near the large stove to eat. If they were late, there might be nothing left to eat, leaving them with empty stomachs.
Eating from food containers?
This is unheard of.
Qiao Hui smiled brightly, holding her own food container, and said, “Sister, take a look.”
Perplexed, Luo Yan’er opened the food container and saw a serving of cabbage, which was a common dish they had during regular meals. After removing the cabbage, she looked inside and found another dish.
Red, green, black… Ah?
And there’s meat too?
How is this possible?
Luo Yan’er looked at Qiao Hui in astonishment.
Qiao Hui leaned in beside Luo Yan’er and opened her food container. Inside, the dishes were exactly the same as Luo Yan’er’s. She said, “I just heard about it. This dish is called Yuxiang Shredded pork, a delicious delicacy introduced today by the Imperial kitchen.”
Luo Yan’er swallowed and asked in disbelief, “How could the dishes from the Imperial Kitchen reach our laundry bureau?”
Seeing that there was no one around, Qiao Hui whispered, “I heard that this dish was invented by the Emperor himself, who ordered that all palace maids and eunuchs must have at least two dishes per meal.”
Surprised, Luo Yan’er picked up her chopsticks, took a gentle bite, and her eyes became moist. She whispered, “The grace of his Majesty…”

Chapter 9: New Regulations in the Imperial Harem and the Grand Secretariat
The reform in the Ming court had yet to begin, but the reform in the imperial harem quietly commenced.
On the 15th of June in the 31st year of the Hongwu reign (1398), Ma Enhui summoned the six bureaus and twenty-four offices of the imperial harem and announced a brand-new system. It included arrangements for food allocation, and daily routines, and innovatively introduced a system of visiting family and monthly rest days.
Both the palace maids and eunuchs were granted two days off each month, during which they were free to leave the palace and visit their families without constraint.
During the Spring Festival, palace maids were allowed to return home for half a month, with the possibility of extending the duration of the journey was long.
To ensure the smooth implementation of the new system in the imperial harem, Ma Enhui ordered that no internal officials were allowed to intentionally create obstacles or hinder the palace maids and eunuchs from visiting their families or taking their monthly rest days. Adjustments to their schedules were permitted if necessary.
It was also required that all eunuchs and palace maids who left the palace were prohibited from disclosing any internal secrets. Any breach of confidentiality would result in the cancellation of their leave and visiting privileges for all eunuchs and palace maids in their respective offices or bureaus, followed by disciplinary actions according to the internal palace regulations.
The introduction of the new system in the imperial harem brought joy and excitement to the long-muted palace. Every palace maid and eunuch eagerly spread the news, and some even spontaneously gathered outside the Chang’an Palace, crying and expressing gratitude for the grace of the Emperor and Empress Ma.
Within moments, the titles of “Holy Emperor” and “Holy Empress” spread throughout the entire imperial harem.
Shuangxi stood at the gate of the Chang’an Palace, watching the palace maids and eunuchs kneeling outside. His eyes were filled with tears as he saw Emperor Zhu Yunwen and Empress Ma Enhui emerge. he called out loudly, “Grace of the Emperor, Grace of the Empress!”
The crowd echoed in unison, their voices resounding throughout the inner palace.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen looked at the kneeling crowd with a stern expression and shouted, “If anyone slackens or fails in their duties, I will be angry. Return to your tasks and do not linger here any longer.”
Everyone kneeled once again and thanked them, and dispersed under the guidance of other eunuchs.
“Why are you crying?” Emperor Zhu Yunwen asked as he noticed Shuangxi choking up.
Shuangxi quickly replied, “Your Majesty, it’s just that I am deeply moved. Now, I feel like I have a purpose in life.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and said, “You should say that you feel like a human being now.”
Shuangxi nodded tearfully in agreement.
Indeed, that’s true.
During the reign of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, eunuchs lived without any dignity. Even the slightest mistake could lead to being beaten to death by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang himself. Especially in the later period of his reign, he became even more ruthless and cruel in his actions. As a result, all eunuchs and palace maids lived in fear, choosing to remain silent and cautious.
Seeing her husband in a joyful mood, Ma Enhui also relaxed. Walking alongside Zhu Yunwen by the lake, enjoying the beautiful scenery, she couldn’t help but express her concern, saying, “Your Majesty, what is the purpose behind these reforms?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at his reflection in the water, unable to reveal the true reason that he no longer regarded eunuchs as human beings. Eventually, the eunuchs were bribed by Zhu Di and became his people.
“Only by bestowing broad and abundant grace can one become a benevolent ruler,” Zhu Yunchuan said calmly.
Ma Enhui nodded emphatically and echoed, “Your Majesty will surely become a revered ruler for generations to come.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Let’s not talk about being a revered ruler for now. I simply feel that embarking on this journey without accomplishing something would be a letdown to my aspirations.”
“Embark on this journey?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t explain anything. He reached out and held Ma Enhui’s hand, saying, “I entrust the affairs of the inner palace to you from now on. Starting today, I need to focus on managing the court.”
Ma Enhui’s face blushed slightly as Zhu Yunwen held her hand in front of so many palace maids and eunuchs.
“Please rest assured, Your Majesty,” Ma Enhui said, lowering her head.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the shy Ma Enhui, gently pulled her closer, kissed her forehead, and then released her. He left bringing Shuangxi and other eunuchs who is holding back their smiles.
The next day, the court assembly was held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.
Zhu Yunwen sat on the dragon throne, looking at the civil and military officials present, his gaze filled with determination.
He recognized some of the officials, but there were others whose names he couldn’t recall even from his memories.
Among the central officials, he could still recognize them. There was Chen Di, the Minister of Rites; Yu Xin, the Minister of Revenue; Bao Zhao, the Minister of Justice; Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel; Zheng Ci, the Minister of Works; and Ru Chang, the Minister of War.
Ministry of War’s Assistant Minister Qi Tai, Hanlin Academy’s Compiler Huang Zicheng, Hanlin Academy’s Attendant Lecturer Fang Xiaoru, Xie Jin, Duke of Wei Xu Huizu, Duke of Cao Li Jinglong, Marquis of Changxing Geng Bingwen, and other influential officials were also present without exception.
This is the second time during Zhu Yunwen’s reign that he has held court during the period of mourning. The last time was when he ascended the throne.
After contemplating for a long time, Zhu Yunwen realized that he lacked several qualities possessed by Zhu Yuanzhang. Firstly, he did not possess the same level of vigor and ability to handle hundreds of matters in a single day. Secondly, he lacked the ruthless methods of Zhu Yuanzhang, who would execute those he suspected without hesitation, even if there were occasional mistakes. Thirdly, Zhu Yunwen felt he did not possess the high level of wisdom required to control the officials effectively. Lastly, he couldn’t bear the thought of a compact life without leisure activities or moments of relaxation.
In summary, Zhu Yunwen realized that he couldn’t emulate Zhu Yuanzhang’s ability to directly manage the six central ministries, involving himself in every detail and personally attending to all matters, big or small.
Zhu Yuanzhang disliked the idea of sharing power with the Chancellor. Through the “Hu Weiyong Case,” he removed the Chancellor position and consolidated all power within himself. However, Zhu Yuanzhang underestimated the role of the Chancellor and overestimated his energy and capabilities.
Nearly every day, more than 200 memorials were submitted to Zhu Yuanzhang, and the number of matters requiring his approval was no less than 400.
Even though Zhu Yuanzhang had taken care of cows, went to war, and had a good physique, he couldn’t withstand the daily exhaustion. Eventually, he had to compromise and selected a group of scholars from the Hanlin Academy to assist him in reviewing the memorials.
And these scholars from the Hanlin Academy were similar to Zhu Yuanzhang’s secretaries. This was the prototype form of the Ming Dynasty’s Grand Secretariat.
Zhu Yunwen, not wanting to utter phrases like “I have seen the palace at three in the morning,” decided to establish the Grand Secretariat, delegating the power of the Chancellor and Holding the ultimate decision-making authority for himself.
The Imperial Palace Eunuch announces the imperial edict:
“By the mandate of heaven, the Emperor decrees: Since assuming the throne, I have shouldered the responsibility of governing the nation. However, I have come to realize the overwhelming complexity of the myriad affairs, making it impossible for me to attend to all matters with full attention. I am deeply concerned that any negligence may cause harm to the people and bring shame upon the founding emperor. Fortunately, with the assistance of esteemed ministers, the court has maintained order, and the hearts of the people remain united.”
“As I have reached the age of maturity, I acknowledge my limited experience in governance. Therefore, it is fitting for me to seek guidance from virtuous ministers and collectively govern the nation. I have long heard of the exceptional talents and abilities of Yuxin, the Minister of Revenue, Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel, and Xie Jin, the Assistant Lecturer of the Hanlin Academy. I hereby appoint Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin as Grand Secretaries and Grand Secretariat Officials, entrusted with the important affairs of the government.” 
“The Wenhua Hall(Hall of Literary Brilliance)[1]The Hall of Literary Brilliance (simplified Chinese: 文华殿; traditional Chinese: 文華殿; pinyin: Wénhuá diàn), or the Hall of Literary … Continue reading shall be transformed into the Grand Secretariat Office. All memorials and reports from the six central ministries and the thirteen provincial administrations shall be submitted to the Grand Secretariat through the Office of Transmission. The Grand Secretariat officials shall review and annotate them before presenting them to the Emperor. After my seal is affixed, they shall be sent to the Office of Transmission, and then transmitted to the six central ministries and the thirteen provincial administrations.”
In ancient times, the Prime Minister held the power of decision-making, policy deliberation, and administrative authority.
The Grand Secretariat system, on the other hand, allocated the power of policy deliberation to the Grand Secretariat while assigning administrative authority to the six ministries. The Emperor retained control over the ultimate decision-making power.
The introduction of the Grand Secretariat left the officials in shock. They looked at each other, somewhat stunned.
Zhu Yuanzhang abolished the position of the Chancellor, but the new emperor ended up appointing three Chancellors in quick succession.
Although they didn’t bear the title of Chancellors, they performed the duties of Chancellors.
The discussions among the officials were heated, but Yuxin, the Minister of Revenue, Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel, and Xie Jin, the Assistant Lecturer of the Hanlin Academy, were particularly excited. This was especially true for Xie Jin, who had returned to the capital after seven years and immediately received such an important appointment, demonstrating the Emperor’s deep trust in him.
The three individuals stepped forward and shouted in unison, “Long live the Emperor!”
Zhu Yunwen issued another decree: “Appoint Assistant Minister of Ministry of War, Qi Tai as Minister of Personnel, Hanlin Academy’s compiler Huang Zicheng as Minister of Revenue, Fang Xiaoru as Hanlin Academician supervising the Grand Secretariat .”
Qi Tai, Huang Zicheng, and Fang Xiaoru immediately knelt to express their gratitude.
Zhu Yunwen deviated from historical precedents. In history, Qi Tai became the Minister of War, Huang Zicheng became the Minister of Rites, with the authority to participate in military and state affairs, and Fang Xiaoru almost became the Chancellor.
These three individuals have become Zhu Yunwen’s core advisory team. Eventually, Zhu Di managed to capture Nanjing!
From now on, history is about to be rewritten.
It’s probably best for Qi Tai given his abilities to focus on personnel matters rather than military affairs.
Although Huang Zicheng may not have many extraordinary abilities, if talented individuals were effectively utilized in the Ministry of Revenue, there shouldn’t be any major issues.
As for Fang Xiaoru, a person who strictly adheres to the principles of “Rites of Zhou” having him assist in overseeing the Grand Secretariat will prevent Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin from acting recklessly.
With the establishment of the Imperial Cabinet, Zhu Yunwen can finally allocate more of his energy to the overall situation and military reforms. In Zhu Yunwen’s view, a ruler should not be personally involved in every matter, but rather delegate power appropriately while maintaining control over the overall direction.
Especially now, Zhu Di remains his biggest adversary, necessitating caution and attention.
With the introduction of the Grand Secretariat, it was only natural that the timing of court meetings would be adjusted. Zhu Yunwen decided to hold court meetings on the first and fifteenth day of each month.
On ordinary days, there was no need for everyone to rush on the road in the middle of the night, risking accidents and drowning in ditches.
The workday started at the hour of the Dragon (around 8 a.m.) and ended at the hour of the Rooster (around 5 p.m.), compared to the previous practice of working for more than ten hours. It was indeed a great benefit.
After the court meeting concluded, Zhu Yunwen retained the three Secretaries and Fang Xiaoru for further discussion.
Yuxin, feeling somewhat excited, looked at Zhu Yunwen and suppressed his excitement as he spoke, “Your Majesty, as the Grand Secretariat is newly established, please kindly instruct us on how it should operate.”
The three secretaries were not fools either. They knew that they only held the power to discuss and advise, and they dared not make decisions on their own. Otherwise, they would meet the same fate as Hu Weiyong.
It would be better to clarify the boundaries early on, clearly stating what they could and could not do. This would provide reassurance and enable them to carry out their duties with peace of mind.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the four individuals before him with appreciation and nodded, saying, “I trust in the abilities of the esteemed secretaries to handle the affairs of the Grand Secretariat. I hope you will work together and ensure that the daily tasks are completed on the same day, without delay until the next day. You may select a group of assistants from the Hanlin Academy to support your work. If there are any unresolved matters, you may report them to the Wuying Hall.”
“For matters concerning military affairs, they should be handled by the Five Army Commandery. As for major national affairs such as appointments and dismissals of officials, and the financial matters of the state treasury, they should be promptly submitted for review. In the case of any border conflicts, there must be no delay in reporting them…”
After Zhu Yunwen made the necessary arrangements, he returned to the harem.
The execution capability of the officials in the Ming Dynasty was exceptionally strong. With the transformation of the WenHua Hall into the Grand Secretariat and the appointment of Grand Secretaries, a new vitality began to emerge in the Ming court.
The following day, Zhu Yunwen proclaimed to the world, bringing an end to the unjust cases of the Hongwu era. He granted amnesty to a group of innocent individuals and also reduced the tax in impoverished regions. He instructed the government to provide support and care for widows, orphans, and the disabled, and provide relief for those affected by disasters.
On the third day, arranging Xia Yuanji and others as envoys, to go around Ming dynasty for inspection.

Chapter 10: Dao Yan Offers Advice to King of Yan, Life in the Imperial Academy
Beiping Prefecture.
In the scorching heat of June, the streets and alleys of Beiping are devoid of liveliness.
Inside the King of Yan’s residence, Zhu Di sits upright in his room, flipping through a military book.
“Your Highness.”
Qiu Fu, the commander of the King of Yan’s guards, reported from outside the room. Upon receiving permission, he entered the room and respectfully addressed Zhu Di, saying, “Your Highness, we have received news from the capital summoning Your Highness to enter the capital.”
“To the capital?” Zhu Di looked at Qiu Fu, his face expressing surprise and doubt.
Having traveled a long distance to mourn, Zhu Di was blocked by Mei Yin’s[1]Mei Yin (14th century – 1405), styled Boyin, was the grandson of Marquis of Runan, Mei Sizu, and the son in law of the founding Emperor of Ming Dynasty Zhu Yuanzhang. He was known for his … Continue reading subordinates in Huai’an, and his pleas were not granted. In the end, he had no choice but to send his three sons to mourn on his behalf. Unable to bid a final farewell, Zhu Di knelt towards the direction of the capital in Huai’an, filled with sorrow and resentment returning to Beiping Prefecture.
Just when I haven’t had a peaceful moment, the court summons me to enter the capital.
“Where did the news come from?”
Zhu Di asked in a deep voice.
Qiu Fu quickly said, “My lord, this is the news we gathered from our sources in the capital. And according to them, there is another major event.”
“What event?”
“The Emperor is reducing the army by 100,000 men!”
“What?”
Zhu Di abruptly stood up, his gaze sharp as he stared at Qiu Fu.
Qiu Fu dared not meet his gaze and lowered his head, saying, “My lord, the imperial envoy will arrive within one or two days. Moreover, I have heard that the news of your summons to the capital and the disbanding of the army is already widely known in the capital.”
Zhu Di furrowed his brows tightly and paced anxiously in the room, saying, “I have been informed. You may go now.”
Qiu Fu withdrew from the room.
Zhu Di sat in his chair, his eyes showing a hint of uncertain anxiety.
Zhu Di, currently thirty-nine years old, was appointed as the King of Yan by Zhu Yuanzhang, when he was only eleven years old in the third year of the Hongwu reign (1363). At the age of twenty-one, he was granted the fiefdom of Beiping.
During the early Ming Dynasty, although the Yuan Dynasty had been driven out of the central plains and forced to retreat to the northern regions, it still maintained a formidable force and constantly harbored ambitions of reclaiming the central plains.
Beiping, being the previous center of the Yuan Empire and the capital, naturally held great importance in terms of defense.
At the beginning of his appointment, Zhu Di, along with the King of Qin, the King of Jin, the King of Ning, and other border kings, guarded the northern borders of the Ming Empire.
After purging a group of military commanders from the Hongwu era, Zhu Yuanzhang entrusted his sons with the defense of the empire. In the 23rd and 28th years of the Hongwu reign (1390 and 1395), Zhu Yuanzhang twice ordered Zhu Di to lead expeditions to the northern frontier.
Zhu Di lived up to the expectations and achieved complete victories in both campaigns, earning him great fame.
Zhu Yuanzhang placed great trust in Zhu Di, especially after the deaths of his eldest son, Zhu Biao, his second son, Zhu Zhan, and his third son, Zhu Gan. As the fourth son, Zhu Di became the leader among the various kings.
One month before Zhu Yuanzhang’s passing, he had ordered Zhu Di to exercise control over the military and defend Kaiping. Zhu Di didn’t receive the command to march out from Zhu Yuanzhang, but instead received the news of his death.
Zhu Di started his journey of mourning but returned midway, leaving the people in Beiping puzzled. This action also caused dissatisfaction among Zhu Di’s subordinates. Though they didn’t dare to openly curse Zhu Yunwen, in private, they held deep resentment towards him.
“Your Highness.”
A voice tinged with worldly wisdom startled Zhu Di’s contemplation.
Zhu Di looked up and saw a thin and elderly monk standing at the door, dressed in a black-striped light red kasaya, with his hands folded in prayer.
“Master Daoyan[2]Yao Guangxiao (姚廣孝, 1335–1418), also known by his dharma name Daoyan (道衍), was a Chinese military strategist, statesman and Chan Buddhist monk who lived in … Continue reading, please have a seat.”
Zhu Di quickly stood up, clasped his hands together in a gesture of respect, and arranged, “It must be exhausting to travel back and forth between the mansion and Qingshou Temple in this summer heat. Why not stay in the mansion for a while?”
Master Daoyan expressed his gratitude, saying, “Thank you, Your Highness. However, I have grown accustomed to the tranquility of the meditation hall at the Qingshou Temple. The summer heat is not much of a bother.”
Zhu Di understood and no longer engaged in small talk. He arranged for tea to be served and sat down, sipping the tea gently while contemplating how to broach the subject.
Master Daoyan remained calm and composed, holding a Buddhist prayer bead in one hand, seemingly lost in thought as he quietly observed Zhu Di.
Although Zhu Di was aware of Master Daoyan’s background, he still found it difficult to see through the person before him.
Originally named Yao Guangxiao, he hailed from Changzhou in Suzhou. At the age of fourteen, he entered the monastic life and was given the Dharma name Daoyan.
Despite being a Buddhist practitioner, Dao Yan was not confined to a single school of thought. He was well-versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and had extensive knowledge in subjects such as astrology, divination, physiognomy, and military strategy.
Their acquaintance began in the fifteenth year of the Hongwu era when Empress Ma passed away. Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the selection of eminent monks to recite scriptures and pray for Empress Ma. The monk Zong Le recommended Dao Yan to serve the king of Yan.
Doa Yan believed Zhu Di possessed the bearing of an emperor, exceptional eloquence, proficiency in both literary and military art, and broad-mindedness, therefore Dao Yan made a firm decision to follow Zhu Di.
Later, Dao Yan arrived in Beiping, and Zhu Di appointed him as the abbot of the Qingshou Monastery, considering him a trusted confidant. They would consult with each other on important matters. After Zhu Di’s unsuccessful attempt to attend the funeral and his return to Beiping, Dao Yan approached him and warned him that the Jianwen Emperor intended to weaken the fiefs and might take action against Zhu Di. He advised Zhu Di to be prepared early, citing the “apprehension of the imperial court,” and also suggested gathering information on the situation.
Zhu Di took Dao Yan’s advice seriously. However, the sudden shift in the court’s direction made it difficult for Zhu Di to ascertain the court’s current attitude.
“Master, have you heard the news from the capital?” Zhu Di broke the silence and asked.
Dao Yan stopped counting the beads on his Buddhist rosary and replied slowly, “I have heard some rumors, but I am unsure of their authenticity.”
Zhu Di let out a sigh and said, “It should be true, but I am uncertain about the court’s stance. I don’t know if this summons is a blessing or a danger.”
Deep in thought, Dao Yan responded, “My Lord, if the court indeed summons you to the capital, in my opinion, it may not necessarily be risky. Perhaps, it could even present an opportunity.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Di’s eyes lit up as he looked at Dao Yan.
Dao Yan explained, “It is widely known in the capital that the Emperor has summoned you and announced the disarmament of 100,000 troops. If this information is true, it sends a message to the world that the Emperor has no intention of curtailing the fiefs—at least not at present.”
Zhu Di gazed at Dao Yan and asked in a deep voice, “Why do you say so?”
Dao Yan replied solemnly, “Firstly if the Emperor intended to forcefully detain the feudal kings who come to the capital for mourning and proceed with curtailing the fiefs, it would instill fear in the hearts of the people and create concerns among the frontier generals. Any slight mishap could lead to mutiny.”
“Secondly, the disarmament of 100,000 troops is not a precursor to curtailing the fiefs. If the Emperor planned to do so, the key would be to weaken the branches while maintaining the core strength. However, the Emperor has not weakened the branches yet but has chosen to weaken the strength first. This indicates his focus on the well-being of the people rather than preparing for curtailing the fiefs.”
“Thirdly, there is no precise news of fief curtailment circulating in the capital. Despite the repeated appeals from Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng, the Emperor remains unmoved. This indicates that the Emperor has not yet made a firm decision.”
“Fourthly, and most importantly, there have been no warnings from your highness former comrades and personnel in the capital. There is no indication of any movement within the capital’s military forces.”
Dao Yan analyzed the situation cautiously.
Zhu Di nodded repeatedly as he listened, but still expressed his concerns and asked, “If the Emperor takes such a risky move and forcefully curtails the fief, what should I do?”
A faint smile appeared at the corner of Dao Yan’s mouth as he said, “If Your Highness goes to the capital and accomplishes a certain task, you will undoubtedly have no worries.”
“Oh? What task?” Zhu Di asked.
Dao Yan spoke slowly, “Make a grand display, rally the support of the citizen and the army.”
Zhu Di fell silent.
Dao Yan’s plan was to bring the hearts of the people and the military to the capital. Once Zhu Di was trapped in the capital, it would inevitably provoke dissatisfaction among the people and the troops in Beiping. At that time, Beiping would descend into complete chaos. And that is something Zhu Yunwen couldn’t bear.
“In that case, I will make another trip to the capital,” Zhu Di made up his mind.
Dao Yan smiled and said, “My lord, there is no need to worry. If you enter the capital, it may present an opportunity. The Five Army Commanders’ Office has many people who are close to you. If we can make some moves and preparations, it may benefit us in the future.”
Zhu Di nodded calmly. After keeping Dao Yan to have a meal, he arranged for someone to escort Dao Yan back to the Qingshou Temple.
As Zhu Di walked through his Mansion, he looked at Ma Sanbao[3]Zheng He (simplified Chinese: 郑和; traditional Chinese: 鄭和; pinyin: Zhènghé; Wade–Giles: Chêng-ho; 1371–1433 or 1435) was a … Continue reading, who was on guard duty, and said, “Prepare yourself. In a couple of days, accompany me to the capital.”
“Understood, my lord,” Ma Sanbao responded solemnly.
The capital city, Imperial Academy.
Xu Miaojin was well aware that being a Chief of Education at Imperial Academy was not an easy task. She would have to endure the criticisms and ridicule of others. Nevertheless, Xu Miaojin accepted the assignment willingly.
Though burdened, it held great significance.
While Xu Miaojin did not know how Zhu Yunwen had managed to quell the turmoil she caused, she respect the customs of the Imperial Academy. She dressed modestly, removing all her jewelry and donning the attire of a refined scholar. With a scholar’s cap on her head, she entered Imperial Academy.
The Chief Scholar of the Imperial Academy, Cheng Shizhou, and the Registrar, Zhang Zhi, received Xu Miaojin’s arrival with calmness. In their eyes, Xu Miaojin was merely a passing guest, a temporary interest of the emperor.
After all, although Xu Miaojin came from a prestigious family and possessed some knowledge, she still had a long way to go, in the Imperial Academy.
If the emperor truly wished to select talent from Imperial Academy, he would not have chosen her.
Rumors had it that Xu Miaojin had begged the emperor for something to do, and out of helplessness, the emperor had agreed to this arrangement.
Upon her arrival, Cheng Shizhou casually exchanged a few words with her and arranged for her to find a place to stay. Afterward, he paid her no further attention. Xu Miaojin was not bothered by this. She understood the principle that if the mountain does not come to you, then you must go to the mountain. She went directly to a hall of record, obtained a list of students at Imperial Academy, and conducted research on their past performances.
Being a student at Imperial Academy allowed for direct appointment to official positions, but life as a student was not easy.
According to the Ming Dynasty regulations, Imperial Academy students had two days off on the first and fifteenth of each month, while the rest of the time was spent either attending classes or self-study. For example, on the second and third of the month, there would be lectures; on the fourth, there would be recitation; on the fifth and sixth, there would be a review of the lectures; on the seventh…
It was either lectures, recitations, or reviews.
Approximately thirteen days of each month were spent on recitation, eight days on the review, and the remaining time was dedicated to self-study, academic assessments, and participating in various activities.
Compared to the scientific education in later times that did not emphasize memorization, Imperial Academy took memorization to the extreme.
Every student had to memorize texts, understand their meanings, and undergo examinations every three days. During each examination, they were required to recite a hundred characters of Edicts, Classics Confucianism Text, and Four books of Confucianism.
Failure to recite accurately resulted in being given ten lashes.
And the lashes were not administered on the palms but on the buttocks…
Each month, there is a requirement to write six essays, two on the interpretation of classics, two on the principles of the Four Books, imperial decrees, memorials, policy discussions, and judicial opinions in the field of internal affairs.
There was no room for slacking off.
The Imperial Academy in the early Ming Dynasty, they were indeed serious about nurturing talent.
However, the majority of students were often labeled as orthodox Confucian scholars, or simply “bookworms.”

Chapter 11: Empire’s Illness, Disloyal Li JingLong?
How Xu Miaojin selects and evaluates talents in the imperial academy is her own matter, and Zhu Yunwen neither wants nor can interfere in it.
Since the establishment of the Grand Secretariat, Zhu Yunwen has finally been able to free himself from countless memorials. Occasionally, he discusses matters with the cabinet ministers and the six ministries, and he appears to be more relaxed.
However, as Zhu Yunwen’s understanding of the Ming Empire deepens, he feels increasingly uneasy. The seemingly prosperous Ming Dynasty is actually like a volcano, and the fundamental problem lies in land occupation and taxation.
Zhu Yuanzhang was cruel in dealing with officials, but he was exceptionally kind to his own family and relatives. He once ordered that his descendants should be supported by the court, meaning that these princes and their descendants didn’t need to work and could rely on imperial provisions at home.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang had good intentions, this rule was seriously flawed. It’s hard to say about other aspects, but one thing is certain, Zhu Yuanzhang was not good at math.
Anyone familiar with “exponential growth” wouldn’t make such a decree.
your Zhu Yuanzhang’s time, how many people were there, and how much food was needed? But have you ever considered that after two hundred years, the descendants of your Zhu family have grown to a population of two hundred thousand? It would cost the court 8.6 million taels of silver annually just to support them. Have you ever looked at the state treasury and how much money is there?
And you stipulated that the descendants of the family don’t have to pay taxes. Fine, you don’t pay taxes, but at least don’t occupy the land. Each king grabs land as if they’re insane, and once they occupy land, they don’t pay any taxes on the output. How does the country sustain itself?
Zhu Yunwen remembers some statistics from the future. The land owned by the vassal kings in Henan during the Ming Dynasty directly occupied one-third of all cultivated land in Henan.
Great, it seems that one-third of the land doesn’t belong to the emperor.
If Zhu Yunwen were to speak, the downfall of the Ming Dynasty is closely related to these seeds of disaster planted by Zhu Yuanzhang.
Everything must be changed!
And it can only be changed during his own era, where the resistance he faces is relatively smaller.
But is it really smaller?
Zhu Yunwen can imagine that those uncles of his will likely attack him on the grounds of “disrespecting ancestral systems,” and these border kings, for their own interests, will inevitably fight back. They are no longer fat pig kings; they are wolves wielding heavy military power.
Not abolishing the fiefs, not reclaiming military power, I can’t even make a move against them!
Zhu Yunwen sighed.
Emperors are not omnipotent.
Zhu Yunwen put down the memorial and said to Shuangxi, “Summon Xie Jin.”
Soon after, Xie Jin entered the Wuying Hall.
Zhu Yunwen picked up a memorial and handed it over, saying, “Read it and give me your response.”
Xie Jin took the memorial and looked at it. This memorial was a secret report from Ge Cheng, the chief secretary of King Yan’s residence. It detailed the scene when Zhu Di was about to enter the capital and leave Beiping Prefecture.
“The common people wailed along the road, and the soldiers wailed endlessly. The direction of people’s hearts is to be feared, truly feared.”
Ge Cheng’s words surprised Xie Jin as well.
“King Yan’s entry into the capital is causing quite a stir.”
Zhu Yunwen sneered and said.
Xie Jin respectfully returned the memorial and quickly said, “Perhaps King Yan is worried…”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, who remained silent, and said, “Worried about what? Worried that I will detain him in the capital? Hah, forget it. Setting aside everything else, just this ability to control people’s hearts, King Yan does it better than me.”
Xie Jin broke out in a cold sweat, deeply alarmed for King Yan, Zhu Di…
The tone of the Emperor was chilling.
It seemed like a murderous intent was brewing.
“Your majesty is the sovereign of a nation, while the King of Yan is merely a vassal king. Although he has been governing Beiping prefecture for nearly twenty years, as long as your majesty gives the order, a large army can quickly capture it,” Xie Jin spoke frankly.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, took a deep breath, and said, “The matter regarding vassal kings, I have a way. I summoned you here today for a certain person.”
“Who?”
“The Judge of Five Army Commandery Tie Xuan[1]Tie Xuan (Chinese: 铁铉; 1366–1402),[1] courtesy name Dingshi (鼎石), was born in Dengzhou, Henan during the Yuan dynasty and was … Continue reading.”
“Tie Xuan?”
“Yes, what is your evaluation of him?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, with a mysterious smile on his lips.
Anyone who has some understanding of the Jingnan Rebellion would surely know the name Tie Xuan. In later generations, especially in various parts of Shandong, there are many temples dedicated to the “Iron Duke,” and the person enshrined there is none other than Tie Xuan of the Ming Dynasty, who brought great trouble to Zhu Di and saved the Jianwen Dynasty from a crisis.
In the Battle of Jinan, he held out against Zhu Di’s forces for three months with a depleted army. Later, Tie Xuan joined forces with Grand General Sheng Yong and pursued the enemy after achieving victory.
As a cabinet minister, Xie Jin naturally had some knowledge of the imperial officials. Upon hearing Zhu Yunwen’s inquiry, he replied, “Is Your Majesty referring to Ding Shi?”
Tie Xuan, with courtesy name Ding Shi, and these two characters were bestowed personally by Zhu Yuanzhang on Tie Xuan.
Seeing Zhu Yunwen nod, Xie Jin continued, “Tie Xuan has a resolute temperament and is intelligent and agile. During the reign of Taizu, he was appointed as a supervising secretary of the Ministry of Rites and worked diligently. He was later transferred to the Commander’s mansion as Judge, he made swift judgments and resolved pending cases. Tie Xuan is highly capable and a pillar of the state.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, realizing that this person had a discerning eye and did not underestimate Tie Xuan due to his current low position.
“Transfer Tie Xuan to the Ministry of War and appointed as Left Deputy Minister.”
Zhu Yunwen issued the order.
Jie Jin quickly accepts.
Zhu Yunwen walked up to a map, looked in the direction of Beiping, and said to Xie Jin, “Our gaze should not only be fixed on the vassal kings. Our Great Ming Empire must become the jewel of the entire world. Come with me, I want to show you guys just how vast this world truly is.”
A fire ignited in Jie Jin’s heart as he looked at Zhu Yunwen with fervent eyes.
Zhu Yunwen laughed and suddenly said, “Arrange for the Ministry of Works to gather craftsmen from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Huguang, Fujian, and Nanzhili, and have them enter the Longjiang Shipyard. I want a fleet of seafaring ships.”
“Seafaring ships?”
Xie Jin looked at Zhu Yunwen in confusion.
However, Zhu Yunwen did not explain further and simply said, “Go and make the arrangements.”
Jie Jin dared not ask further and could only leave with his doubts.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware of the vastness of the world and knew that Christopher Columbus had not been born yet.
The West enjoys colonization, don’t they?
Let the Great Ming Empire confront them and see who is more formidable, whether it’s them or the Great Ming Empire.
Most importantly, Zhu Yunwen wanted to send people to South America, not for colonization and conquest, but rather for potatoes, peanuts, chili peppers, corn, tomatoes, and tobacco…
And rubber trees as well.
During the early Ming Dynasty, it was unfortunate that these common ingredients and products that are easily found in later times were nonexistent.
Even something as simple as tomato and egg stir-fry was impossible to enjoy.
Smoking? Forget about it.
As for the combination of potatoes with beef, it was probably just a dream.[2]TL’s note: in ancient times, killing cows is against the law.
For food… no, in order to improve resources, alleviate famine, and benefit the Ming Dynasty, it was necessary to establish a fleet.
Zhu Yunwen sat beside his desk, He held a brush and drew on the paper, feeling a bit awkward. But there was no other choice, as pencils did not exist in this era. However, there were chalks available.
“That’s right! A blackboard!” Emperor Zhu Yunjuan suddenly exclaimed.
He called over Shuangxi and instructed, “Go to the Bureau of Works and find some thin wooden boards, A length of about one zhang (approximately 10 feet) and a width of three to four chi (approximately 1-1.3 meters) would be sufficient. Additionally, bring some black lacquer as well.”
After Shuangxi carefully noted the instructions, he quickly went to make the arrangements.
Shortly after, Shuangxi returned with the requested items. Zhu Yunwen instructed Shuangxi and other eunuchs to apply several layers of black lacquer on the wooden boards and let them dry outside. He also had Shuangxi find some chalk, the chalk wasn’t made from lime but from natural white chalk(calcium carbonate).
“Your Majesty, Duke of Wei has arrived,” Shuangxi informed Zhu Yunwen amidst the busy preparations.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected translation:
Zhu Yunwen nodded, and after Xu Huizu paid his respects, Zhu Yunwen asked, “How is the disarmament proceeding?”
Xu Huizu wore a troubled expression and sighed, “Your Majesty, we have already dismissed five thousand soldiers…”
“Five thousand? Didn’t I tell you to reduce the army by a hundred thousand?” Emperor Zhu Yunwen expressed his dissatisfaction.
Xu Huizu quickly stood up and apologized, saying, “Your Majesty, the disarmament is fraught with difficulties. I dare not act arbitrarily…”
“Do you mean someone has pressured you and prevented the disarmament?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu, who immediately knelt down.
“I have heard that Duke Cao visited the capital army and instigated a group of people to resist the disarmament. Is this information true?”
Zhu Yunwen asked in a soft voice.
Xu Huizu glanced at Zhu Yunwen and couldn’t determine his attitude, so he cautiously replied, “Duke Cao did visit the capital army, but I don’t know if it is related to the resistance against disarmament, Your Majesty.”
“You don’t know, or you dare not say?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu, who gritted his teeth and remained silent. Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and said, “Rise. You are in charge of the central Military Inspectorate. If you cannot handle even such matters properly, it would disappoint me.”
Xu Huizu trembled all over and hurriedly said, “I will do my utmost and not disappoint Your Majesty’s trust!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said solemnly, “You can inform Duke Cao and all the noble officials that the disarmament of one hundred thousand soldiers is my decree. If anyone is dissatisfied, they can come to me and voice their concerns. You just focus on executing the plan. I still trust Duke Wei’s loyalty.”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen, his emotions stirring.
After returning to the Military Inspectorate, Xu Huizu finally felt relieved. Compared to offending these noble colleagues, it was not wise to offend the boss.
Colleagues can be replaced, but bosses are not easily replaced.
Xu Huizu had this realization. As a result, the ambitious plan of military downsizing finally began, and whether it was Duke Cao, other marquises, or royal relatives, anyone who had occupied positions in the military with their servants and subordinates would be eliminated without exception.
In the mansion of King Qiyang, Duke Cao, Li Jinglong, was engaged in bird fighting when a voice came from a distance, “Big brother, Xu Huizhu is challenging us.”
“What’s the matter? talk it out!” Li Jinglong called out to his younger brother, Li Zengzhi, with a frown.
Li Zengzhi approached, stomped his foot in anger, and said, “I just received news that Xu Huizhu has issued an order to dismiss military personnel. The quotas associated with us have been eliminated, and some old generals with connections to our Li family have been expelled from the army.”
Li Jinglong looked at Li Zengzhi, his expression turning serious, and asked, “Did Xu Huizhu really take action?”
Li Zengzhi nodded repeatedly, gritting his teeth as he said, “Big brother if we don’t do anything, who will listen to us?”
“Insolence!” Li Jinglong shouted sternly, looking at the startled Li Zengzhi. He said with seriousness, “The capital Garrison does not belong to us but to the emperor! If the emperor wants to dismiss, let him dismiss.”
“But…”
Li Zengzhi was getting anxious.
Li Jinglong fell silent for a moment, then slowly said, “Is the King of Yan about to arrive in the capital?”

Chapter 12: Your Majesty, is Extraordinary!
Tie Xuan is currently conducting an investigation of military crimes and prisons at the Commander’s Office. Some officials and soldiers, relying on their connections with influential families, have been daring enough to forcibly seize civilian women. It is shocking that such incidents occurred right under the Emperor’s nose, especially during a period of mourning.
If these actions are not met with punishment and severe consequences, they will not be enough to deter others and instill fear in their hearts.
But Tie Xuan was also aware that behind those soldiers stands the second most powerful figure in the military:
Li Jinglong!
Li Jinglong is the son of King Qiyang, Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong is none other than the only nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang. He was even regarded as a son by Zhu Yuanzhang and was renamed Zhu Wenzhong.
Zhu Yuanzhang is Li Jinglong’s grand-uncle, and Zhu Di and other Princes are Li Jinglong’s uncles. Emperor Jianwen, Zhu Yunwen, is Li Jinglong’s cousin. With such influential figures, how can Tie Xuan, a mere fifth-rank official in charge of the commander’s office’s judge, confront them?
But Tie Xuan is unwilling to submit and refuses to yield!
As a result, in the verdict document, tie Xuan issued the order for execution!
Perhaps, not long after, Li Jinglong would send someone to confront him, even arranging for officials to impeach him, leading to a miserable outcome.
But I, Tie Xuan, have a clear conscience!
There was a commotion outside the door, Tie Xuan sat proudly with his back straight, staring towards the entrance.
A messenger named Wan Gui from the Ministry of Personnel entered the room, holding an imperial decree, and shouted, “I bring a decree!”
Tie Xuan quickly stood up and knelt down, followed by the other attendants and personnel in the room.
Some people thought that Tie Xuan was in trouble and secretly rejoiced, but as they listened to the contents of the decree, it seemed to be quite different.
Iron Xuan heard the words “appointed as the left Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War” and was somewhat stunned.
He, a fifth-ranked official, had suddenly become a third-ranked official.
After Wan Gui finished reading the decree, Tie Xuan stood, thanked, and receive the edict with confusion. Wan Gui approached and congratulated him, saying, “Assistant Minister Tie, you have achieved a great leap forward. Congratulations, sir.”
Tie Xuan knew that Wan Gui was seeking favors, so he casually searched and found three taels of silver and gave them to Wan Gui.
Wan Gui’s mouth twitched, but he didn’t want to show disdain. He believed that a mosquito’s meat was also meat, so he accepted the coins with the belief that every little bit counts. Moreover, Tie Xuan was clearly favored, and it wouldn’t look good if things turned sour. After a brief conversation, Wan Gui hurriedly left.
It is worth mentioning that in many TV dramas, eunuchs are often portrayed as delivering imperial edicts, arriving at the residences of officials, and proclaiming phrases like “You’ve been promoted” or “You’re finished.” While it may seem cool and majestic, it was not quite realistic in the Ming Dynasty.
In the Ming Dynasty, there was a specialized department called the “Department of Messengers” (行人司), which was responsible for delivering imperial edicts. Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang had a clear understanding of the role of eunuchs, stating that they were only servants responsible for cleaning and performing specific tasks, without any other appointments or excessive authority.
In short, eunuchs were just household slaves.
Of course, when it comes to announcements within the imperial court, delivering verbal orders from the Emperor, the Emperor delegates eunuchs to deliver the Imperial decrees, and the Department of Messengers is primarily responsible for external affairs.
After his promotion, Tie Xuan naturally needed to report to the Ministry of War. The Minister of War, Ru Chang, welcomed Tie Xuan and engaged in some small talk before arranging for him to enter the palace.
“His Majesty has sent word for you to settle in first then enter the palace,” Ru Huang said, looking pleased.
Ru Huang had great confidence in Tie Xuan’s abilities, especially considering that Tie Xuan was still in his early thirties, at the prime of his youth. His future prospects were promising.
Tie Xuan held a deep respect for Ru Huang. In the early Hongwu reign, Ru Huang served as the right vice Imperial Censor, later acting as the Minister of War, and eventually being officially appointed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the Minister of War due to his outstanding performance.
Tie Xuan showed utmost respect to this “old minister” despite being only forty years old.
“Minister Ru, may I know the reason why his Majesty assigns me to the Ministry of War?”
Tie Xuan was somewhat puzzled.
After all, there were not many officials in the bureaucracy who directly rose to their positions as he did. Most people either had someone recommend them or had the trust of the emperor.
Recommendation?
He don’t personally know the ministers of the Imperial Cabinet, nor was he familiar with the officials of the six ministries. Working at the Commander’s Office, he has offended a group of people, and He believes no one would be willing to recommend him.
A trusted person?
Although He has seen the emperor, the emperor has never seen him.
With so many people in the court, who would care about a low-ranking official like him? he only barely has the qualification to attend court sessions.
Standing outside the main hall, even if he were to take a nap, no one would know.
Ru Chang looked at Tie Xuan and smiled, saying, “Compared to you, I only received the news two hours earlier. I heard that the emperor values you greatly. If you have any doubts, why not speak directly to the emperor?”
“Since that’s the case, I will pay a visit to the emperor. Thank you, Minister Ru.”
Tie Xuan stood up, bowed, and took his leave.
Zhu Yunwen was in a separate room in the Wuying Hall, busy drawing a world map. He had strictly ordered that no one was allowed to enter the room without his permission, at any time.
Shuangxi could only wait outside the door, unaware of what Zhu Yunwen was doing inside.
When Tie Xuan arrived and his presence was announced, Zhu Yunwen finally came out and allowed Tie Xuan to enter. After granting him a seat, Zhu Yunwen smiled and asked, “Minister Tie, do you have any doubts?”
Tie Xuan nodded repeatedly and said, “I am filled with fear and unease, afraid of not living up to Your Majesty’s grace.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and said, “Nonsense. You will be the future Minister of War, and I have great confidence in your abilities. I have called you here for a specific matter.”
Tie Xuan’s eyebrows lifted, and he felt a surge of excitement in his heart.
Tie Xuan didn’t fully understand the hidden meaning behind “you will be the future Minister of War,” but he sensed that it implied he would be promoted to the position of Minister of War within a few years.
“I humbly ask for Your Majesty’s guidance,” Tie Xuan said.
Zhu Yunwen asked, “You were at the Five Army Commandery, so I presume you are aware of the order to reduce the army by 100,000 soldiers. Do you think there are any flaws in my command?”
Tie Xuan hesitated as he looked at Zhu Yunwen but eventually said, “I believe Your Majesty’s decision has its merits and shortcomings.”
“Hahaha, don’t worry, speak freely. I won’t blame you,” Zhu Yunwen reassured him.
Zhu Yunwen provided Tie Xuan with some reassurance.
Tie Xuan replied solemnly, “Your Majesty, reducing the army by 100,000 soldiers can save a considerable amount of resources and military expenses, benefiting the country. The number of 100,000 may seem significant, but it will not undermine the strength of the capital’s garrison troops. Those soldiers are mostly old, weak, or in unnecessary positions.”
“It seems you understand my intentions. What are the shortcomings, then?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Tie Xuan spoke frankly, “Reducing the army by 100,000 soldiers will primarily affect the honorable and distinguished figures of the nation. Once they become dissatisfied, it may lead to unrest. Additionally, with the vassal kings stationed outside the capital commanding substantial military forces and guarding the borders, if Your Majesty weakens the garrison troops in the capital, there is a risk that the vassal kings could grow more powerful and pose a threat to the capital, potentially causing significant disturbances.”
“Oh, do you believe the vassal kings will rebel?” Zhu Yunwen asked with great interest.
Tie Xuan fell silent.
This was an important question and a difficult one to answer.
After all, these vassal kings were Zhu Yunwen’s family members. If Tie Xuan said they would rebel, he had no evidence to support his claim, making it mere speculation. How could he convince the Emperor without concrete proof?
But if he said they wouldn’t rebel, Tie Xuan believed that was highly unlikely.
Especially the current King of Yan, Zhu Di, although his ambitions are not yet fully revealed, there are hints to be observed.
By using a posthumous decree to prevent Zhu Di from entering the capital for mourning, it can be inferred that Zhu Yunwen also believed Zhu Di had rebellious intentions.
Tie Xuan sighed and replied solemnly, “Your Majesty, among the Kings, the King of Yan, the King of Ning, and the King of Qin, particularly the King of Yan and the King of Ning, harbor ambitious aspirations. While I dare not assert with certainty, based on my speculation, if no action is taken to curtail their power, it is likely that within two years, the King of Yan will make a move.”
Zhu Yunwen took a deep breath and silently praised:
What a remarkable Tie Xuan!
Following the historical timeline, Zhu Yunwen began the process of reducing the powers of the vassal Kings in August of the 31st year of the Hongwu era. Zhu Di rebelled in the first year of the Jianwen era in June, spanning two years but actually less than a year of time.
Although Tie Xuan was working as a judge in the Five Army Commandery, his vision extended beyond just matters of prisons. He took into account the overall national situation.
Such a person had the foresight of a prime minister!
Zhu Yunwen secretly sighed. In history, Zhu Yunwen was such a fool. He didn’t know how to employ talented officials and only relied on a few bookworms, missing several opportunities to defeat Zhu Di.
If he had entrusted important positions to people like Tie Xuan, Sheng Yong, Ping An, and Xu Huizu, Zhu Yunwen could confidently assert that Zhu Di would never have made it to the capital!
“The reduction of 100.000 troops is only the beginning. The strategy for elite soldiers extends beyond their individual physical abilities. It encompasses their beliefs, military preparations, logistics, and various other aspects. By promoting you to the Ministry of War, I hope you will undertake the crucial responsibility of training new troops in the capital.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Tie Xuan with seriousness.
During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Five Armies Commandery were established to oversee the military. However, to prevent the Commandery from acquiring excessive power and the commanders from becoming too influential, it was stipulated that although the Five Armies Commandery had the authority to command troops, but they did not possess the power to deploy them.
The power to deploy troops was held by the Emperor alone.
The Ministry of War had the authority to appoint, promote, and train the military but did not have the power to command troops.
Initially, the Five Armies Commandery had significant power, and the Ministry of War was overlooked and deemed insignificant. However, Zhu Yuanzhang made several revisions, aiming to avoid concentrating power in a single office and to ensure that matters were not obstructed. As a result, the power of the Five Armies Commandery was weakened, and certain powers were bestowed upon the Ministry of War.
Although the Five Armies Commandery were inevitably involved in the training of new troops, it was still the Ministry of War that took the leading role.
Tie Xuan finally understood Zhu Yunwen’s intention. He stood up, straightened his posture, and solemnly exclaimed, “I will not disappoint the grace of heaven!”
Zhu Yunwen took a document from the table and handed it to Tie Xuan, saying, “Here is the new strategy I have formulated for the training of new recruits. Study it carefully when you return. I want a comprehensive and viable training plan. You can discuss this matter with the Ministry of War and Duke of Wei.”
After paying his respects, Tie Xuan left and returned to the Ministry of War, placing the document on his desk with a hint of skepticism.
What does the emperor know about training strategies?
Training new troops still requires the collective efforts and brainstorming of the Ministry of War and the Five Armies Commandery. They need to work together to come up with solutions.
After all, it was the emperor’s laborious work. if he didn’t read it, it would be disrespectful to His Majesty’s hard work. Tie Xuan didn’t hold much hope, but when he opened the document and read through it, he suddenly stood up. The more he read, the more serious his expression became. Finally, he slammed the table and exclaimed, “Your Majesty, is Extraordinary!”
Ru chang furrowed his brow, glanced at Tie Xuan, and thought to himself, even if you’re trying to please the emperor, you shouldn’t do it in the Ministry of War’s main hall, right?
To his surprise, Tie Xuan hastily approached, holding the document and handing it to Ru Chang.
Ru chang looked at it, looked again, and suddenly stood up, slamming the table and declaring, “Your Majesty, is extraordinary!”

Chapter 13: The Strategy for New Recruits and the Challenges of Commerce
Strictly speaking, Zhu Yunwen had no understanding of new recruit training in the true sense. However, as the emperor, he didn’t need to be well-versed in the details; that was the responsibility of his ministers. The emperor only needed to provide overarching guidance and coordinate the overall situation.
With the perspective of future generations and drawing from historical knowledge, Zhu Yunwen drafted a comprehensive training plan.
The plan consisted of five parts: physical training, ideological development, battlefield arrangements, equipment upgrades, and special forces development.
It includes a mixture of special forces training methods learned from television and movies, ancient military command strategies on the battlefield, and training methods employed by exceptional ancient commanders, etc.
Naturally, physical fitness is crucial, in the era where cold weapons were predominant, The personal physical fitness, qualities, and combat capabilities of soldiers directly impact the outcome of battles.
Physical strengthening training is essential.
We cannot have soldiers who are out of breath after taking three steps or collapsing after walking ten steps going into battle, can we?
Regarding ideological development, Zhu Yunwen dared not mention anything about communism. After careful consideration, the best approach to instill Marxist-Leninist ideology would result in his own downfall.
As an emperor, it is important to approach it from the perspective of an emperor, respecting objective facts, which is known as a materialist view of history.
Without embracing Marxist-Leninist beliefs, we can promote the heroic spirit of “dying for the cause,” the patriotic spirit of “loyalty to the country,” and the national spirit of “assisting the monarch in governing the nation and maintaining peace throughout the land.”
Supplemented by promotions and rewards benefiting their descendants, it is enough to make soldiers willingly devote themselves to serving the court.
Regarding the arrangement of battle formations, Zhu Yunwen did not elaborate much, as it is the expertise of military commanders. However, he did propose the concept of the “Three Great Camps” and advocated for the practice of new battle formations and tactics.
Equipment upgrade is a matter of great importance to Zhu Yunwen.
Indeed, during the early Ming Dynasty, there were already firearms and ammunition. However, at that time, the long guns were called “huo chong,” and the short guns were called “shou chong.” But these weapons had limited range, ranging from tens of meters to two hundred meters.
Moreover, after firing one shot, they needed to be reloaded before the second shot could be fired, making it difficult to establish a comprehensive firepower network.
With a range of two hundred meters, when facing rapidly approaching cavalry, by the time you have fired two shots, they could already be charging at you with their sabers swinging.
As for cannons, although the “Francois machine” has not yet been introduced to the Ming Dynasty, there were still some cannons available, such as the Shenchong carriage cannon and the Great General cannon.
These cannons were still useful, with longer ranges reaching up to 3 kilometers, and even exceeding 4 kilometers.
However, they were nothing more than a pile of iron, weighing between two hundred to four hundred catties (approximately 100 to 200 kilograms). At that time, the Ming Dynasty did not have trucks or trains for transportation, nor did they have paved roads. After rainfall, the roads would become muddy. Who could transport these heavy cannons?
Furthermore, warfare requires speed, rapid maneuvering, and swift interchanges. If you’re carrying a large cannon, just waiting for it, how many miles can you travel in a day?
Therefore, in the Ming Dynasty, these cannons were mostly used for city defense or, after surrounding enemy cities, brought in to blast open the city gates.
Considering them as an independent branch and integrating them into the battle formation did not exist.
Now, Zhu Yunwen has made it clear that not only does he want to establish musket squads, but he also wants to establish artillery squads, giving them a resounding name: the Artillery Corps.
As for the special forces, Zhu Yunwen’s requirements are even stricter. He demands the selection of four thousand elite soldiers from the four hundred thousand-strong Beijing garrison for special training, truly picking the best of the best.
Minister of War, Ru Huang, looked at the lengthy document of nearly ten thousand characters, his hands trembling slightly. He raised his head and glanced at Tie Xuan, who still wore a look of astonishment and admiration on his face.
“Did the emperor really draft this?”
Ru Huang couldn’t believe it.
If the current emperor possessed such foresight, the Ming Dynasty would flourish in both culture and martial prowess!
A true era of prosperity was on the horizon!
And when that time comes, his name will surely be recorded in the annals of history!
Tie Xuan gradually regained his composure, nodding emphatically. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “The emperor’s actions are undoubtedly feasible. The path to a strong military will be accomplished in our hands. Now I understand, this is the true confidence behind the emperor’s decision to reduce the army by a hundred thousand!”
Ru Huang lowered his head and glanced at the strategy for new recruits, shaking his head slightly. He said, “As the Minister of War for nearly a decade, I have never come across such profound insights. Our emperor first implemented the Cabinet, rectifying the court, and now he is implementing the strategy for new recruits to forge a new army. It seems that our monarch has far-reaching concerns.”
Tie Xuan collected the document and looked at Ru Huang with seriousness, saying, “This matter requires consultation with the Duke of Wei.”
“The Duke of Wei? Only the Duke of Wei?”
Ru Huang was taken aback.
Tie Xuan looked at Ru Huang and suddenly realized the situation.
In theory, although the emperor trusted the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, it was not right to completely disregard the Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong. But the emperor had never mentioned Li Jinglong at all.
This meant that Li Jinglong did not have the emperor’s favor.
Tie Xuan frowned slightly and said, “We will follow the Emperor’s orders. As for other matters, they are not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War.”
The power struggles within the Five Army Commander’s Office did not extend to the Ministry of War.
Tie Xuan did not want to get involved in them. He only wanted to refine the strategy for the new recruits and train the capital army as soon as possible.
In the Wuying Hall, side hall.
Based on his memory, Zhu Yunwen roughly sketched a world map. Looking at the direction of South America, his gaze then turned towards Europe.
In the 31st year of the Hongwu era, around the year 1398 AD,
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio had passed away several decades already, but the European Renaissance was still ongoing.
The Hundred Years’ War between England and France was likely still being fought.
Capitalism in Europe was beginning to emerge, and in a few more decades, the Age of Discovery would unfold.
The time left for the Ming Dynasty was not much.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that if naval power and maritime exploration were not given importance, China would become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society over four hundred years later. At that time, foreign powers would ravage and exploit the land of China at will.
Zhu Yunwen did not want such a history to repeat itself.
However, embarking on long voyages was not an easy task.
One major factor was the lack of funds.
Zhu Yunwen had visited the imperial treasury, and while it was filled with wealth, it did not belong solely to him.
In fact, many people believed that the imperial treasury was the emperor’s personal property. Strictly speaking, this view was incorrect.
During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor, he believed that the whole world belonged to him, so why would he need to set aside private funds?
‘drawing a snake and adding feet to i[1]TL’s note: its Chinese idiom, meaning: spoiling things by doing something unnecessary.
“Emperors consider the world as their own family, and the wealth of the world should be used for the benefit of the world. Why should there be a distinction between public and private? Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty also held the same view!” these are Zhu Yuanzhang’s original words.
Zhu Yuanzhang believed that the downfall of the Song Dynasty was related to the imperial family’s establishment of the internal treasury, which used national resources for personal use.
Therefore, during the early Ming Dynasty, the internal treasury was essentially the national treasury.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang implemented the internal treasury system, it lacked effective supervision and management. Additionally, due to Zhu Yuanzhang’s lack of education in economics, there was a tendency to print money without linking it to gold or silver reserves.
By the time of Zhu Yunwen’s reign, the state of the national economy had already deteriorated to some extent.
In the later period, Zhu Yuanzhang also recognized this issue. For example, he made adjustments to officials’ salaries by changing them from salary notes and salary rice to only salary rice.
There was no choice, as paper money was not widely accepted.
Moreover, in the Ming Dynasty, a significant portion of tax revenue came from agricultural taxes, which essentially meant collecting grain as taxes.
During Zhu Yunwen’s reign, having three million taels of silver in the central treasury was considered decent. Of course, if we consider grain as a form of currency, the income would be over ten million taels of silver.
Indeed, a significant portion of the money and grain was allocated to support the military. The military forces of the frontier regions, the capital city, and the local areas all required funding for their maintenance. Additionally, government officials also received salaries.
Especially for the princes and imperial relatives, many of them lacked any real abilities but still received substantial salaries, sometimes even more than the ministers of the cabinet.
With such expenditures, the national treasury would often be depleted by the end of each year.
Zhu Yunwen sighed, realizing that if they were given a few more years of peaceful development, the economy of the Ming Dynasty could improve. However, in the current situation, could true peace be achieved?
As for Zhu Di, the formidable figure, would he choose to resist to the end or submit?
This was something Zhu Yunwen couldn’t determine.
“Industry and commerce,” Zhu Yunwen murmured to himself. If they couldn’t lift the restrictions on industry and commerce, relying solely on the agricultural output of the peasants to make Ming Dynasty prosperous would be almost impossible.
However, in the Ming Dynasty, there were no merchants.
Zhu Yuanzhang had a strong hatred for merchants and even issued the command “Those who do not engage in production can be captured and killed.” It can be said that among the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the Ming Dynasty had the lowest status for merchants.
This may be related to Zhu Yuanzhang’s background. Additionally, his family members were harmed by unscrupulous merchants, which further fueled his belief that merchants were as detestable as corrupt officials and needed to be severely suppressed.
During the early Ming Dynasty, there were only official statuses for soldiers, farmers, and craftsmen. The concept of a merchant class simply did not exist.
The policy of “focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce” became a fundamental state policy for Zhu Yuanzhang.
The biggest challenge in changing this policy is not Zhu Yuanzhang who already rests in the Xiaoling Mausoleum, but rather the deeply ingrained Confucian ideology of “focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce.”
Government officials preferred stability and the development of the agricultural economy.
As for merchants? Today they are in the capital, tomorrow in the northern part, and the day after tomorrow they might be doing business at sea. How can we possibly manage them?
They should stay rooted in the land, tightly controlled and managed, shouldn’t they?
Moreover, if merchants continue to accumulate wealth, it will result in a concentration of riches, leading to a shortage of wealth in the country. How can the common people survive?
Perhaps these were the sentiments of officials during that era.
However, history has proven that outdated systems cannot restrain the mighty force of economic laws.
Ming Dynasty merchants found ways to navigate through these restrictions. For example, they would affiliate themselves with certain registered statuses. They would first buy a piece of land and make it clear that they were farmers, merely engaged in agricultural activities. But as for why they engaged in business, should they not be allowed to pursue additional sources of income?
If that was not feasible, they would collaborate with military households and assume military status. They would have their son or nephew join the army on their behalf. He was soldier, who dare to interfere with his business?
These merchant collectives, disguised under different identities, became significant drivers of the Ming Dynasty’s economy.
They still carried heavy shackles on them, indeed.
Zhu Yunwen understood that merchants needed to be legalized, as it was the key to unleashing the market’s potential.
As for how this fierce bull of commerce would move, it would depend on how it was guided.
However, now was not the right time, because Zhu Di was about to enter the capital.

Chapter 14: Great Ming Security Bureau.
Reforms are never an overnight process. Zhu Yunwen was familiar with Marxist-Leninist principles and understood the importance of “seeking truth from facts.” Simply transplanting the experiences and mindset of future generations to the Ming dynasty would only result in resistance and an unsatisfactory outcome.
For now, setting aside commercial matters, the construction of the court was of utmost importance. Despite the apparent stability of the court, hidden currents were constantly surging, and a significant portion of these undercurrents originated from the influential nobility groups.
These noble factions were often composed of the second generation of the nobility, exerting considerable influence within the court.
Unfortunately, the majority of the first-generation nobility were essentially exterminated by Zhu Yuanzhang, and only a few managed to survive. Tang He, the Duke of Xinguo, survived, but he passed away from illness three years ago.
Geng Bingwen, the Marquis of Changxing, is still alive, but he is already sixty-four years old and primarily a skilled defensive general. While his loyalty is not a major concern, his age makes him unfit for the rigors of battle and unable to deter the ambitions of the younger generation.
For the past few days, Zhu Yunwen has been studying the reform of the Five Army Commandery. Without transforming the military structure, it will be difficult to realize the dream of a strong army.
The dilemma of having commanders who lack military knowledge and soldiers who do not recognize their leaders greatly undermines the combat effectiveness of the army.
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze is fixed on the position of the Left Army Commandery in the organizational chart, where there is a name: Li Jinglong.
Zhu Yunwen despises Li Jinglong because, in history, Li Jinglong was a complete imbecile and traitor.
During the Jingnan Rebellion, Emperor Jianwen appointed Li Jinglong as the Grand General and entrusted him with leading a force of five hundred thousand troops to attack the nine gates of Beiping. As Commander Qü Neng was about to breach the Zhangye Gate, Li Jinglong, fearing that Qü Neng would steal the credit, ordered a retreat, resulting in a defeat.
Later in the Battle of Baigou River, Li Jinglong suffered a major defeat, abandoning all his troops, and fleeing back alone to Nanjing.
Not to mention, during Zhu Di’s assault on Nanjing, Li Jinglong acted as a treacherous traitor and, together with the King of Gu, Zhu Hui, opened the Jinchuan Gate of Nanjing, allowing Zhu Di to easily conquer the city.
Zhu Yunwen is well aware of this period in history.
Although Li Jinglong had not betrayed Zhu Yunwen at this time, Zhu Yunwen did not like him at all for being a fool, an idiot, and a potential traitor.
If Zhu Yunwen had not just ascended to the throne and reigned for a short period, he might have even considered killing Li Jinglong.
Shuangxi knocked on the door.
Zhu Yunwen walked out of the side hall, and Shuangxi respectfully handed him a memorial, saying softly, “Your Majesty, Duke of Wei has sent a confidential report.”
Zhu Yunwen opened the confidential report and read it carefully. When he came across the words “Front Army Left Commander Li Zengzhi has left the city and headed straight to Yangzhou Prefecture,” his gaze slightly hardened, emanating a chilling aura.
“Where is the King of Yan?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly replied, “He has passed Huai’an and should be approaching Gaoyou soon.”
Just south of Gaoyou[1]Gaoyou (simplified Chinese: 高邮; traditional Chinese: 高郵; pinyin: Gāoyóu), is a county-level city under the administration … Continue reading is Yangzhou Prefecture.
A cold smile crept onto Zhu Yunwen’s lips. He hadn’t even had the chance to meet Zhu Di yet, and these military officials and nobles had already taken the initiative to make contact. Did they really think he was blind?
Li Zengzhi was nothing to worry about, but behind him stood Li Jinglong, who held considerable power.
Indeed, the influence of Li Wenzhong still lingers, and there are close connections between Li Jinglong and Li Wenzhong’s former subordinates. Moreover, Li Jinglong holds the title of Marquis of Cao. Unless he commits a significant offense, it won’t be easy to take action against him.
As an emperor, one must consider methods, reasons, and implications before making decisions. It’s not as simple as speaking a few words to resolve a person’s fate.
As powerful as Zhu Yuanzhang was, he still came up with a pile of excuses when he killed Hu Weiyong.
After careful consideration, Zhu Yunwen burned the confidential report and said to Shuangxi, “Some people’s appetites are never satisfied. They always want to eat more without considering whether their stomachs can digest it all.”
Shuangxi lowered his head, not daring to speak.
“Never mind, let them be. What are those Kings and princes in the capital busy with?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly responded, “Your Majesty, the princes haven’t been particularly active these days, although Prince Gaoyang, Zhu Gaoxu, has been a bit more conspicuous. He has been seen frequenting some entertainment venues with Li Zengzhi.”
“Heh, unable to withstand a little loneliness even during the mourning period. It seems that Zhu Gaoxu also has his shortcomings…” Zhu Yunchuan chuckled lightly.
If a person cannot even control their own desires, their achievements will inevitably not last long.
Achieving greatness requires willpower, wisdom, capability, and also self-discipline, knowing what one should and should not do!
“But…”
Shuangxi hesitated.
“But what?”
Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly knelt and said, “Your Majesty, it’s just a rumor I heard…”
“Speak up, I won’t blame you,” Zhu Yunwen reassured.
Shuangxi said, “Your Majesty, I have heard that the King of Ning has a close interaction with the Duke of Cao, and they have been getting drunk together in the King of Qiyang’s residence in recent days. However, I cannot confirm the truth of these rumors.”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and asked, “What else have you heard?”
Shuangxi said with unease, “I have also heard that the King of Ning is skilled at making connections and has close ties with influential military figures…”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Investigate who told you this information and apprehend them for interrogation.”
“Ah?”
Shuangxi looked at Zhu Yunwen in surprise.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Shuangxi with a somewhat cold gaze and said, “You are my eyes and ears. What you hear and see is often what others want you to hear and see. Go and investigate. Someone wants to divert my attention to the King of Ning. Find out who is so clever!”
Shuangxi broke out in a cold sweat and remained kneeling.
“It seems that it’s time to reinstate the Jinyiwei (Embroidered Uniform Guard)[2]The Embroidered Uniform Guard (traditional Chinese: 錦衣衞; simplified Chinese: 锦衣卫; pinyin: Jǐnyīwèi; lit. ‘brocade-clad guard’) … Continue reading,” Zhu Yunwen sighed inwardly.
He cannot rely solely on the Five Military Commandery or the Grand Secretariat to know everything. These individuals all have their own personal interests and networks. If someone deliberately conceals information, he would only be a deaf and blind person sitting in the depths of the palace.
The Jinyiwei was created by Zhu Yuanzhang. It was originally known as the Gongwei(Guarding and Escort) Bureau, later transformed into the Imperial Guards office, overseeing the emperor’s ceremonial guards and attendants. In the fifteenth year of the Hongwu reign, Zhu Yuanzhang disbanded the Office of Imperial Guards and reestablished it as the Jinyiwei.
During the early Ming dynasty, The main authority of the Jinyiwei was to be responsible for the direct escorting of the emperor, performing guard duties, and conducting patrols and apprehensions, They were directly responsible to the Emperor. The Jinyiwei had the power to arrest any individuals, including members of the imperial family and high-ranking officials,. Furthermore, they had the ability to conduct interrogations without the involvement of the three judicial offices.
During the Hongwu era, the Jinyiwei dressed in “flying fish” uniforms, was a nightmare for many ministers.
A Sentence in “Ming History, Study of Law”, proves the terrifying nature of the Jinyiwei: “Case of Hu Weiyong, Lan Yu, Implicated and persecuted up to forty thousand people.”
This kind of mass persecution was largely a result of the actions carried out by the Jinyiwei, and of course, it was related to the paranoid nature of Zhu Yuanzhang and his tacit approval.
In the twentieth year of the Hongwu era, Zhu Yuanzhang abolished the Jinyiwei. However, after Zhu Di ascended to the throne, the Jinyiwei was reinstated and, along with the notorious “Eastern Depot,” became one of the most feared organizations in the Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that the ministers would undoubtedly oppose the reinstatement of the Jinyiwei. They were weary and afraid of those dark and oppressive days. However, Zhu Yunwen also refused to be without obedient ears and eyes.
Relying solely on the Five Military Commandery, Grand Secretariat, and the Imperial Censor, it is highly likely that other voices may not be heard.
Zhu Yunwen doesn’t advocate violence, but he needs an institution similar to the Jinyiwei to gather information and provide more detailed intelligence for him.
In consideration of the significant resistance faced in directly restoring the Jin Yi Wei, Zhu Yunwen decided to establish a new department under his direct control, responsible for various intelligence investigations within the Ming Empire. This department will be named the “Great Ming Security Bureau(大明安全局).”
Zhu Yunwen establishes the Great Ming Security Bureau, It’s only a reorganization of the emperor’s personal guard and its application. This does not require approval from the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries. However, to prevent panic among the Grand Secretariat and court officials, Zhu Yunwen issues a decree with the following general idea:
The Great Ming Security Bureau is primarily responsible for Combatting actions that pose a threat to the security of the Ming Dynasty, Engaging in covert operations against enemies, Safeguarding national security, and Maintaining social and political stability.
As for gathering intelligence, investigating military situations, and gathering information, these activities are also carried out in the interest of the security of the Ming Dynasty.
To prevent the excessive power and arbitrary actions of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Zhu Yunwen issued an order stating that the bureau is not allowed to arrest, detain, or interrogate any government officials without his or the Grand Secretariat’s permission.
In other words, the Great Ming Security Bureau has the authority to conduct investigations and take action, but it does not have the power to arrest or interrogate individuals. If the need for interrogation arises, it must be done in collaboration with the Three Judicial Offices. The bureau cannot independently carry out interrogations
Compared to the Jinyiwei, the Great Ming Security Bureau has indeed had its fangs removed.
Even if the Grand Secretariat wanted to oppose, they couldn’t voice their opposition. Some officials in the court expressed concerns and were preparing to submit memorials to voice their opposition. However, before the memorials could be submitted, they were confiscated by the Grand Secretariat and they might even be destroyed tomorrow.
The Emperor has given face to the Grand Secretariat and the central government. The Grand Secretariat and the central government also need to take care of the Emperor’s dignity, don’t they?
Even Fang Xiaoru, who advocated civil governance, did not utter a word of dissent regarding the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
In essence, the Great Ming Security Bureau and Jinyiwei are not different; both are independent intelligence and security agencies responsible to the Emperor.
But in terms of characteristics, Jinyiwei was like a wild and untamed wolf that would pounce on anyone it saw, relentlessly biting and attacking. It would continue biting one person after another. On the other hand, the Great Ming Security Bureau is different. It is more like a horse held by a rein. While it can neigh and run freely, it ultimately will not bite anyone.
Fang Xiaoru does not oppose the existence of such an institution because he understands it is a means for the emperor to maintain his rule.
If the higher-ups do not speak up, the voices of those below will be futile.
On the tenth day of July in the thirty-first year of the Hongwu era, Zhu Yunwen issued a clear decree to establish the Great Ming Security Bureau.
The Great Ming Security Bureau stepped onto the stage of Ming history, becoming a blunt yet formidable sword in the hands of Zhu Yunwen. Though it may not appear sharp, it is unstoppable!
On July 16th, outside the city of Yangzhou.
Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi, who was approaching from a distance. With a smile on his face, he turned to Qiu Fu beside him and said, “These people still have their uses.”
Qiu Fu glanced at Li Zengzhi and smiled, saying, “Your Highness’s words are absolutely right.”
As they approached closer, Li Zengzhi dismounted from his horse and shouted loudly, “Li Zengzhi, the Left Commander of the Front Army, pays respects to the King of Yan.”
Zhu Di quickly dismounted and called out, “Commander Li, please rise quickly. After traveling for over a month, it is comforting to see family here in Yangzhou Prefecture.”
Li Zengzhi, seeing Zhu Di’s approachable demeanor and referring to him as family, couldn’t help but smile. He quickly extended his invitation, saying, “Uncle, I have made arrangements in the city. Please come with me and take some rest before continuing your journey to the capital.”

Chapter 15: Zhu Yunwen’s Transfer Order
Li Zengzhi is the second son of the King of Qiyang, Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong is also a nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang. From this family relationship, Li Wenzhong and Zhu Di can be considered first cousins.
Therefore, Li Jinglong and Li Zengzhi need to address Zhu Di as their paternal uncle.
In his youth, Zhu Di studied warfare under the guidance of Li Wenzhong, establishing a close relationship with both Li Jinglong and Li Zengzhi.
Now, Zhu Di is traveling from Beiping to the capital, Jinling[1]TL’s note: The Capital of the Ming dynasty in the early era is Nanjing or Jinling, and encountering “family” in the city of Yangzhou naturally brings him joy. In addition, Li Zengzhi, being competent and efficient, makes arrangements for Zhu Di and his entourage to enter Yangzhou, He directly rented an entire tavern and ordered soldiers to guard it, prohibiting anyone from approaching.
After three rounds of drinking, Li Zengzhi dismisses those around him, and Zhu Di remains calm, raising his hand to signal Qiu Fu and others to also leave the room.
Seeing that there were only themselves in the room, Li Zengzhi felt relieved. He raised his cup and toasted Zhu Di, saying, “Uncle, we are family, so there’s no need for formalities.”
Zhu Di nodded silently.
Li Zengzhi asked in a low voice, “Uncle, to be honest with you, the emperor’s intentions are hard to decipher, some time ago, he established Grand Secretariat, introduced a new military policy, and just recently established the Great Ming Security Bureau. Both the court and the people are filled with anxiety.”
“Oh? What happened?” Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi and asked.
Regarding Zhu Yunwen’s methods, Zhu Di has heard about them and supports them.
Even if he ascends to the throne, it is necessary to have a group of capable individuals to handle important tasks on his behalf. Otherwise, the emperor would have to directly manage the court, and review every matter, and it would be exhausting and burdensome.
Zhu Di considers the establishment of the Grand Secretariat to be a brilliant strategy.
As for the military reforms and the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Zhu Di finds them acceptable and does not believe that these measures would cause widespread anxiety among the people.
Li Zengzhi sighed and said, “Nowadays, the central power of the court is concentrated in the Six Ministries and the Grand Secretariat. Officials can only see the emperor twice a month, and even if they submit memorials or impeach someone, they may be detained by the Grand Secretariat. If this continues, the sovereignty of the Ming Dynasty will become the sovereignty of the Grand Secretariat.”
Zhu Di calmly sipped his wine.
Zhu Di was well aware of the extent of power held by the Grand Secretariat. He considered Li Zengzhi’s words to be exaggerated.
Li Zengzhi continued, “The implementation of the New Military Policy requires the reduction of 100,000 soldiers, and among these 100,000, many of them are from our noble ranks. Especially some of the commanding officers in the guards who have close ties with us, they have been stripped of their official positions and forced to leave the capital garrison along with their comrades.”
“These comrades have come to our doorstep. Should we intervene or not? If we intervene, we can’t manage all of them, and we can’t go against the emperor’s will. If we don’t intervene, how can we bear to see them wandering the streets as former comrades?”
“The emperor is only focused on implementing the New Military Policy, but it has shaken the foundation of the capital garrison. It is a sign of chaos. Moreover, this Great Ming Security Bureau is clearly just another name for the Jinyiwei. It hasn’t been long since the emperor took over the reins of power, yet he has already violated the intentions of the founding emperor by reinstating the Jinyiwei. It seems that the emperor hasn’t truly grasped the governing strategies of the founding emperor.”
Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi and the words “lack of understanding of the founding emperor’s governing strategies” flashed through his mind like a bolt of lightning.
This is a perfect reason!
The founding emperor abolished the position of Chancellor, and Zhu Yunwen established the Grand Secretariat as a replacement.
The founding emperor expanded the capital guards, and Zhu Yunwen downsized them.
The founding emperor abolished the Jinyiwei, and Zhu Yunwen established the Great Ming Security Bureau.
Based on Zhu Yunwen’s recent actions, his style of governance and methods are clearly contrary to those of the founding emperor!
If we use the pretext of “disrespecting the founding emperor and deviating from his governing strategies” to prove that Zhu Yunwen is not a qualified successor to the empire, then when the time comes to raise an army, we can proclaim the slogan of “upholding the founding principles and restoring ancestral systems.” We will let the world know that I, Zhu Di, am the true rightful heir who best understands and can grasp the founding emperor’s governing strategies!
Li Zengzhi noticed the gleam in Zhu Di’s eyes, the unspoken desire he held. He lightly tapped his finger on the table and said, “Uncle, we are family.”
Li Zengzhi deliberately emphasized the word “we,” speaking slowly and exchanging meaningful glances, conveying a hidden meaning.
Zhu Di, being an intelligent person, understands the underlying message in Li Zengzhi’s words.
Li Zengzhi was telling Zhu Di that if Zhu Di had the intention, they would be his strength to help him achieve greatness.
Zhu Di put down his wine cup and chuckled, “The recent days of traveling have indeed made me weary. Drinking too much now seems to overwhelm me.”
“Changing the wine is not difficult at all. It only requires…” Li Zengzhi raised an eyebrow, picked up a nearby wine jug, and casually poured it onto the ground. He looked at Zhu Di and slowly said, “Since the wine is spilled, we can only bring in new wine.”
Zhu Di narrowed his eyes, listening to the sound of the wine spilling onto the ground, which seemed to resemble the neighing of a thousand horses. He composed himself and said, “When the wine is spilled, there are always people who will set it right.”
Li Zengzhi stared at Zhu Di and softly asked, “Under the blade of the founding emperor, many souls perished, but the King of Yan stands unchallenged.”
Zhu Di took the wine jug from Li Zengzhi, poured himself a cup, and drank it in one gulp. He said, “I wonder if the wind is strong in the capital. If the weather is good, I’d like to take a walk on Purple Mountain[2]Purple Mountain or Zijin Shan (Chinese: 紫金山; pinyin: Zǐjīn Shān; lit. ‘Purple-Gold Mountain’) is located on the eastern side … Continue reading.”
Li Zengzhi nodded solemnly and said, “Your Highness, I’m sure everything will go as you wish.”
After this conversation, Li Zengzhi understood Zhu Di’s thoughts. Zhu Di wasn’t without thought of betrayal, but he had yet to make up his mind. On one hand, he worried about the imperial army besieging him, and on the other hand, he feared that Zhu Yunwen would suddenly act against him in the capital.
However, thanks to Zhu Yuanzhang, Most of the founding heroes of the Ming Dynasty, especially the military commanders, have been largely exterminated. Among the few remaining leaders capable of commanding the army in Ming, there were only a handful, including the King of Yan Zhu Di and the King of Ning Zhu Quan.
And the other, Li Zengzhi, around Ming Dynasty, was just mediocre.
Zhu Di understood Li Zengzhi’s words and recognized them as an opportunity. However, he was well aware that along with opportunities came great challenges.
Zhu Yunwen was the emperor, and he had the power to mobilize the entire nation’s forces to besiege Zhu Di. The military strength at his disposal was not limited to a mere million troops.
Also, Zhu Yunwen is in Nanjing, his own army is in Beiping, separated by over two thousand miles. Even if Zhu Yunwen doesn’t send a single soldier, it would still take him at least a month to travel there, and if we consider logistics and supplies, it could take several months.
Even if Zhu Yunwen lacks capable generals, his vast army is enough to make Zhu Di extremely cautious. He needs to carefully consider his options and think twice. If Zhu Yunwen becomes ruthless or if he makes a wrong decision, he could easily be eliminated.
Zhu Di doesn’t want to die.
Rebellion comes with great rewards, but they also come with great risks.
If successful, He could reign over the world.
If unsuccessful, He could meet his demise.
After seeing Zhu Di off to rest, Li Zengzhi bids farewell at the door with a smile, saying, “Uncle, we’ll meet again in the capital.”
Zhu Di in a somewhat drunken state, lies on his bed, contemplating his next move.
The distance between Yangzhou Prefecture and the capital is less than 200 miles. If traveling on horseback, one can reach the capital tomorrow evening. Zhu Di is curious about how Zhu Yunwen will act in this situation.
But the current Zhu Yunwen seems different from the Zhu Yunwen he used to know.
He no longer appears as the benevolent and hesitating person he once was. Instead, he possesses a decisive and ruthless determination, as well as a decisive power of strategic thinking.
What surprises Zhu Di, even more, is that his nephew, Zhu Yunwen, seems to have great insights and exhibits the qualities of a wise ruler when it comes to governing the country.
Unable to unravel his own confusion, Zhu Di can only fall into a drowsy sleep while contemplating.
In the magnificent palace illuminated by bright lights, Zhu Yunwen is listening to the report of Liu Changge, the first commander of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
Liu Changge rose from humble beginnings and experienced several major battles. He showed great bravery during the “Desert Expedition” led by Lan Yu and was later selected by Zhu Yuanzhang to join the Imperial Guards.
This obscure figure in history, whose name cannot be found, ascended to the historical stage because Zhu Yunwen and become head of the Great Ming Security Bureau—the Commanding Officer.
Zhu Yunwen chose Liu Changge not only for his unquestionable loyalty but also for his exceptional abilities. He had a keen understanding of written texts and was highly strategic in his thinking.
He had a remarkable perceptiveness, able to discern the smallest details and predict the outcome of events based on subtle indications.
This is Zhu Yunwen’s assessment of Liu Changge.
Since the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Liu Changge has devoted himself wholeheartedly. Within a short week, he has selected three thousand skilled individuals from the imperial guards and deployed them both inside and outside the capital to gather intelligence and investigate matters.
Liu Changge reported to Zhu Yunwen, saying, “Li Zengzhi had a secret conversation with the King of Yan for two hours. However, we were unable to ascertain the specific details.”
Zhu Yunwen pondered for a moment and said, “Even if you treat someone well if they harbor ulterior motives, they won’t appreciate it.”
Liu Changge dared not say another word.
Zhu Yunwen smiled lightly and said, “You may leave for now.”
Liu Changge bowed and withdrew.
After contemplating for a while, Zhu Yunwen turned to Shuangxi, who stood by with lowered hands and said, “Instruct the Grand Secretariat to draft an imperial decree appointing Zhang Bing as Beiping’s chief secretary. Ping’an and Sheng Yong as the Commanders of Beiping, with Ping’an in charge of defense affairs in Beiping. Transfer Qu Neng and Xu Kai, the Commanders of Sichuan, to station their troops at Shanhai Pass [3]Shanhai Pass or Shanhaiguan (simplified Chinese: 山海关; traditional Chinese: 山海關; pinyin: Shānhǎi Guān) is one of the major passes in … Continue reading, Kaiping[4]Kaiping (Chinese: 开平), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Hoiping,[a] is a county-level city in Guangdong Province, China.

“Tell Ping’an, Sheng Yong, Qu Neng, and others to treat the soldiers well and ensure that the army obeys the orders of the court. If anyone disobeys, they can enforce military law! Reassign the commanding officers as necessary, and I grant them the authority!”
Shuangxi solemnly remembered these instructions in his mind and hurried to the Grand Secretariat.
On that night, Xie Jin presided over the Grand Secretariat and heard the emperor’s orders, which, though unexpected, were within his expectations.
King of Yan Zhu Di had always been the emperor’s focal point.
Without a doubt!
Xie Jin couldn’t quite grasp Emperor Zhu Yunwen’s intentions. It seemed that the emperor was confident that the other princes wouldn’t pose a threat and focused his attention solely on Zhu Di. However, considering the current situation, it was indeed Zhu Di who posed the greatest threat among the kings.
Xie Jin drafted the edict, and Zhu Yunwen used the imperial seal to validate it. The General Secretariat promptly transmitted the orders throughout the night.
Zhu Yunwen decided to make a preemptive move and observe Zhu Di’s reaction.
Ping An, Sheng Yong, and Qu Neng are all outstanding military commanders who emerged during the Jingnan Rebellion. Zhu Yunwen dispatched all three of them to the north, specifically to keep an eye on Zhu Di, he believe Zhu Di understand what this military threat means.
On the evening of July 17th, Zhu Di arrived at the outskirts of the capital city, but instead of entering the city, he chose to rest outside for the night.
The next morning, Zhu Di’s carriage crossed the river and arrived at the Sanshanmen Wharf. Instead of appearing proud and arrogant, he was dressed in white and wept bitterly, calling out loudly, “Father, your son has come late.”

Chapter 16: The First Confrontation with Zhu Di
Zhu Yunwen sat in the Wuying Hall, accompanied by Grand Secretary Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, Xie Jin, and Fang Xiaoru. Liu Changge, the commander of the Great Ming Security Bureau, constantly reported to Zhu Yunwen about the activities of Zhu Di after his entry into the city.
Zhu Di did not return to his residence in the capital city. Instead, he moved through Jinling City, wailing as if in a funeral procession. Perhaps feeling that his own voice was too faint and easily broken, Zhu Di had his three sons join him in crying.
Zhu Di had previously embarked on expeditions to Mongolia, which had significantly raised his fame. Coupled with the big commotion of his arrival, as he made his way through the cities, people in the city, regardless of age, eagerly hoped to catch a glimpse of the King of Yan’s elegance.
What kind of elegance can a weeping King of Yan possess?
It merely evoked silent sympathy from the people in the city.
After all, a son arrives late to mourn his departed father.
Whose fault is it?
It is the fault of the Emperor!
Have you not heard that the King of Yan was intercepted at Huai’an on his way to mourn?
Otherwise, could the King of Yan have arrived so late?
It’s just that no one dares to directly say that the Emperor made a mistake.
In ancient times, it was believed that the Emperor could do no wrong.
Anyone who dared to criticize the Emperor would face consequences once it was known by the imperial court. They could be scolded or even killed.
Zhu Di indulged himself in acting to his heart’s content. His voice grew hoarse from shouting, his stomach became empty, and his mouth felt dry and parched. Unable to continue his performance, he led his entourage out of the city through the Jubao Gate[1]The Zhonghua Gate (traditional Chinese: 中華門; simplified Chinese: 中华门; pinyin: Zhōnghuámén), previously Jubao Gate (聚宝门)is a gate and defensive complex on … Continue reading and went to Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

Ming Xiaoling mausoleum is located at the southern foot of Purple Mountain, and … Continue reading
He wailed at Xiaoling throughout the afternoon until it grew dark before returning to the city.
It is said that Zhu Di cried until he fainted, but it is unclear whether it was due to exhaustion from acting or if he accidentally fell asleep.
Liu Changge reported Zhu Di’s activities, as well as the activities of people and vassal kings in the city to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen, however, remained calm and listened attentively. Zhu Yunwen even invited the three cabinet ministers and Fang Xiaoru to have lunch and dinner. However, their discussions were not about Zhu Di but rather focused on the issue of taxation in Jiangnan[3]Jiangnan, also romanized as Kiangnan, Chiang-nan, and Jiang Nan, is a geographic area in China referring to lands immediately to the south of lower reaches of … Continue reading.

Zhu Yuanzhang is known for his vengeful nature, after becoming the Emperor, he reduced and exempted taxes in many regions to revive production. However, only the Jiangzhe region had its taxes increased several-fold.
Not only that, but Zhu Yuanzhang also issued an edict prohibiting individuals from Jiangzhe regions from holding positions in the Ministry of Revenue. He even included this provision in the “Imperial Ming Ancestral Instructions” to ensure that future generations would abide by it.
“Excessive taxation in Jiangzhe” was indeed a pressing issue that Zhu Yunwen had to address.
In Zhu Yunwen’s view, the Jiangzhe regions had always been prosperous since the old times, with a history of wealth, prominent merchants, and thriving cultural and educational development. These regions were crucial for his vision of establishing a grand commercial empire in the future.
A Jiangzhe region stifled by oppressive taxation would lack the means and conditions to foster a prosperous business landscape. What’s more concerning is that excessive taxation can significantly dampen productivity and hinder economic growth.
If everyone refrains from productive activities, it can lead to social instability. Zhu Yunwen needs a stable and prosperous Jiangzhe region.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Jian Jin all support the reform of taxation in Jiangnan, even if it means breaking away from the principles outlined in the “Imperial Ming Ancestral Instructions.”
Similarly, Fang Xiaoru also supports the reform and emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the welfare of the people. He even quotes Zhu Yuanzhang’s words, “Rest the people and accumulate resources; this is how life and livelihood are sustained.” Fang Xiaoru advocates for lighter burdens and lower taxes.
Zhu Yunwen agrees with their opinions and is about to issue an edict. However, Fang Xiaoru adds, “Your Majesty, according to the ‘Rites of Zhou,’ the implementation of the well-field system in the Jiangzhe regions can enhance the national strength.”
“well-field system?”
Zhu Yunwen’s teeth began to ache slightly.
The well-field system is from the slave society period, implemented during the Shang Dynasty, prevalent during the Western Zhou Dynasty, disintegrated during the Spring and Autumn Period, and abolished during the Warring States Period.
A system that has already been abandoned by the times, and yet you still want to bring it back and use it?
Although the well-field system adopted a system of state ownership, where the emperor granted land to nobles and officials who would then have slaves work on the land, the land was not allowed to be bought, sold, or transferred. This system allowed the nobility to reap the benefits.
Such a system restricted productivity and has been discarded by the passage of time.
He didn’t expect that Fang Xiaoru would actually want to revive it?
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that all of Fang Xiaoru’s actions, thoughts, and methods stemmed from the “Rites of Zhou.” He found Fang Xiaoru to be overly idealistic.
“Mr. Fang, I presume you have read ‘Master Lu Spring and Autumn Annals: Examining the Present'[6]The Lüshi Chunqiu, also known in English as Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals,[1][2] is an encyclopedic Chinese classic text compiled around 239 BC under … Continue reading, haven’t you?”
Zhu Yunwen did not directly respond to Fang Xiaoru’s statement. Instead, he replied with a question of his own.
Fang Xiaoru quickly nodded and said, “I have read it.”
Zhu Yunwen earnestly spoke to Fang Xiaoru, “In the state of Chu, there was a person who accidentally dropped his sword into the river while crossing it. He immediately marked the spot on the boat and said, ‘This is where my sword fell.’ When the boat stopped, he entered the water to search for it. However, while the boat moved on, the sword did not move. Isn’t it perplexing to search for the sword in this way? Do you recall this passage, Mr. Fang?”
Fang Xiaoru nodded.
Zhu Yunwen continued, “You dropped the ‘Rites of Zhou’ into the water, and while the boat moved forward, the ‘Rites of Zhou’ followed along in the hidden currents. Carving the boat and searching for it, is the ‘Rites of Zhou’ still there?”
Fang Xiaoru looked at Zhu Yunwen in confusion.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin suddenly realized and understood that the Emperor was warning Fang Xiaoru not too rely heavily on “Rites of Zhou” as a guiding principle, that thing is too old, and not effective anymore.
Adaptation is necessary for smooth progress.
Fang Xiaoru, being astute, understood it and respectfully receive the teaching and stepped aside.
Zhu Yunwen ordered Xie Jin to draft a decree, proclaiming “Grant the world, next year land rent by half”[7]Tl’s note: it means reducing the farming land rent by half. reducing the tax burden in Jiangzhe regions and implementing the policy “land not exceeding one dou[8]TL’s note: although dou used in measuring weights, in ancient times it also used to measure size of land. One dou is around 267 square meters, please correct me if I’m wrong., the people of Suzhou, Songjiang allowed to become officials in ministry of revenue.”, breaking Zhu Yuanzhang’s ancestral teachings.
After resolving the issue of Jiangzhe region’s taxes, as the day grew late, Zhu Yunwen arranged for someone to escort the Grand Secretaries and Fang Xiaoru back home. Then he assigned Wang Yue of The Directorate of Imperial Accouterments to go and meet Zhu Di.
According to court regulations, when a king enters the capital, he is required to spend the night in the Eastern penthouse outside the Gate of Supreme Harmony and present himself to the emperor the next morning.
After settling Zhu Di in, Wang Yue had a conversation with him and expressed that the emperor and the empress dowager were pleased with his arrival. He advised Zhu Di not to be too saddened by the situation.
Zhu Di showed his eloquence and tact, saying that he had brought special products from Beiping. After meeting the emperor the next day, he planned to visit the Empress Dowager at the Cining Palace. He acknowledged his delayed arrival and hoped that Wang Yue could speak a few kind words on his behalf to avoid any blame from the emperor.
As Zhu Di saw Wang Yue off, he maintained a smiling face. However, once Wang Yue left, his smile disappeared.
Zhu Di has already heard the news, the emperor issued an order overnight to assign Zhang Bing, Ping An, Sheng Yong, Qu Neng, and others to take control of Beiping. Meanwhile, troops were stationed along the line from Shanhai Pass to Kaiping.
it is likely that these individuals are already on their way. Zhu Di’s mood is not high, and he is filled with worry and fear, which occasionally overwhelms him.
It is true that it is unlikely for Zhu Yunwen to take action against Zhu Di in the capital during the mourning period. However, he could take action against Beiping. Currently, He is in the capital, and Zhu Gaozhi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui are also present. In the King of Yan’s Mansion in Beiping, there are not any individuals who can handle the situation besides Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng.
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, are both military commanders, and they have little understanding of strategies. Once they become agitated and cause trouble out of shock, even before he returns, Beiping Prefecture will fall into the hands of Zhu Yunwen.
Taking a step back, if Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng don’t make any moves, Zhu Yunwen will not take any action against himself, when he returns after a period of time, considering the travel distance, it will take at least a month or more.
A period of over a month is enough for Zhu Yunwen to handle the entire defense of Beiping, as well as the surrounding defenses.
And moreover, the personnel appointed by Zhu Yunzhong have made Zhu Di filled with fear!
Sheng Yong?
Zhu Di doesn’t think this person will pose a threat to himself and can be ignored.
But Zhu Di cannot ignore the other two individuals!
The first person is Qu Neng!
Qu Neng, from an early age, accompanied his father in the military and gained extensive combat experience. He excelled in horsemanship, archery, and possessed strategic acumen, earning him a renowned reputation in the court and the public.
Later, he was appointed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan, responsible for overseeing military affairs in the western border regions and assisting the King of Shu, Zhu Chun, in governing the region of Ba and Shu. The region enjoyed two hundred years of peace and prosperity, largely attributed to Qu Neng’s contributions.
He is a formidable individual who is both skilled in martial arts and strategy, making him a formidable force to be reckoned with.
Compared to Qu Neng, the person Zhu Di is more wary of is the second person:
Ping An!
Zhu Di’s eyes revealed a sense of anger and unease.
Ping An, is not an ordinary person, let alone the fact that he was adopted son of Zhu Yuanzhang. Speaking of Ping An himself, he is extremely brave and skilled in battle. In his early years, he accompanied Zhu Di on expeditions beyond the borders and was well acquainted with Zhu Di’s military strategies.
This person knows his capabilities, and Zhu Di also knows his capabilities.
Zhu Di’s hands trembled slightly. Whether he returned or not, it would be extremely difficult to resolve this situation.
Zhu Yunwen, his own beloved nephew, had made such decisive moves! This night, Zhu Di couldn’t sleep peacefully.
The next morning.
Zhu Yunwen arrived at the Hall of Supreme Harmony, with officials standing in their respective positions on the left and right. Zhu Di, who had been waiting in the penthouse, changed into the attire of a King, with Zhu Gaochi and others standing beside him.
The ceremonial officials come out and welcomed the king of Yan into the palace.
Zhu Di followed the ceremonial official, he walked along the imperial path and ascended the dais, and sat on the throne. Zhu Gaozhi and others knelt beside him.
The ceremonial music began, and Zhu Gaozhi and the others turned to the north and prostrated themselves.
Zhu Di gazed toward the north, with fluctuating expression, but he did not kneel.
The officials on both sides of the dais were puzzled and also felt anxious for Zhu Di. If Zhu Di didn’t perform the proper ceremonial gesture, it would be a great disrespect to the Emperor, and the Emperor could use this incident to take action against Zhu Di and strip him of his position as the vassal king.
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze turned towards the outside of the hall, observing Zhu Di who is standing without bowing.
He is a renowned historical Ming emperor, a legendary figure who established the prosperous era of the Yongle, and a formidable warrior who brought great glory to the Ming dynasty.
But it seems that he does not want to pay respects to him!
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curled into a smile, a smile that carried a hint of coldness.
If he refuses to pay respects.
Then let him lie down, it wouldn’t be a bad thing to accompany Zhu Yuanzhang.
Zhu Yunwen is not the Jianwen Emperor in history, the Jianwen Emperor was lenient and hesitant towards Zhu Di, appearing timid like a woman. Zhu Yunwen knows about Zhu Di’s ambition and future, aware of his preparations and threats.
Kill one person to ensure peace in the world, Zhu Yunwen has no reason to hesitate.
At this moment, Zhu Di is hesitant.
Bowing to the north signifies acknowledging Zhu Yunwen’s position as the emperor, which will pose significant difficulties for Zhu Yunwen’s next actions. At the very least, he cannot use Zhu Yunwen’s “manipulating Imperial edicts” as an excuse to manipulate public opinion.
Because, he has submitted, and agreed to it.
If he doesn’t bow to Zhu Yunwen, and Zhu Yunwen uses it as an excuse to take action against him, how can he smooth things over?
The power in the hands of his nephew is no longer just a bunch of bookworms and civil officials, but a force that sends shivers down his spine!
To bow or not to bow!
To submit or not to submit!
Zhu Di was caught in a dilemma, his gaze piercing through space, looking towards Zhu Yunwen sat on the throne in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and the throne beneath Zhu Yunwen!

Chapter 17: Zhu Di, Bowed!
Standing without bowing!
With a proud demeanor, Zhu Di gazed resolutely toward the direction of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. His upright posture resembled an unwavering spear as he boldly questioned the heavens above.
The officials outside the hall were stunned, exchanging astonished glances with one another. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.
The commotion among those people reached inside the grand hall.
However, the officials in the grand hall, refraining from being disrespectful, did not turn around to look back and remained unaware of what was happening outside.
The first round of salutations is concluded.
The inner praising official trembled as he invited Zhu Di to step forward and led him to the Royal seat in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. He then retreated with cold sweat covering his body.
At this moment, the ceremonial music resumed.
According to the ceremonial protocol, Zhu Di needs to bring his three sons to kneel and pay respects to the Emperor.
Zhu Gaozhi and his two brothers obediently knelt down following the ceremonial music, but Zhu Di remained standing. Not only that, he wore a proud expression and stared directly at Zhu Yunwen.
The officials in the hall who had not witnessed Zhu Di’s refusal to kneel before, now after they saw this scene, the hall erupted in chaos instantaneously, The hall was filled with buzzing voices of discussion.
Fang Xiaoru stepped forward and sternly accused, “Your Majesty, the King of Yan entered the hall without bowing, showing disrespect to the ritual etiquette and lacking the proper loyalty of a subject. I beseech Your Majesty to punish the King of Yan for his grave disrespect!”
“I concur!”
Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, stepped forward and voiced his agreement.
The head of the Ministry of Rites has spoken, and naturally, the deputy ministers and other officials from the ministry need to express their stance as well.
Seeing this situation, other officials also followed suit in voicing their agreement.
Zhu Yunwen scrutinized Zhu Di, as the distance was too far before, making it difficult to see clearly. Now, being closer, he could observe more distinctly.
Zhu Di had thick, arched eyebrows, a straight nose, deep and bright eyes, and a large beard. Along with his imposing presence, there was an air of arrogance about him.
Zhu Yunwen stared at Zhu Di and suddenly burst into laughter.
A burst of laughter echoed through the hall.
Zhu Di’s heart trembled for a moment!
The Zhu Yunwen in front of him, instead of being angry or furious as Zhu Di would have expected, was laughing?
Based on Zhu Di’s understanding of Zhu Yunwen, he should have been infuriated, pointing at him in a state of disarray, unable to utter a single word!
But now, he was laughing!
This laughter carried with it confidence, strength, and an indescribable pressure that made Zhu Di tremble.
The ministers remained silent, unsure why Zhu Yunwen was laughing.
Zhu Yunwen suppressed his laughter and looked at Zhu Di, slowly saying, “This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, not a casual hall. If the King of Yan is tired and not yet awake, you can go to the casual hall and rest for a few hours. We will wait for you to wake up!”
Zhu Di was instantly at a loss for words, his face filled with anxiety.
Zhu Yunwen’s meaning was clear: this place was where the Emperor and ministers discussed important state matters, and regardless of whether Zhu Di was the King of Yan or anyone else, he must adhere to the protocol of the Emperor and ministers.
If Zhu Di felt indignant and wanted to cause trouble because of being “prevented from mourning,” it didn’t matter!
But you must understand, the matter of mourning is a family affair of the Zhu family. If you want to discuss family matters, go to the side hall.
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony!
There is only Emperor and his subjects!
Only discuss state affairs here!
With a single sentence from Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Di found himself blocked from all possible retreats.
In fact, Zhu Di intended to use the excuse of being hindered in mourning for Zhu Yuanzhang’s death to confront Zhu Yunwen. If Zhu Yunwen claimed to be following a posthumous decree, another problem would arise: Zhu Di could question why Zhu Yunwen allowed other vassal kings to enter the capital while denying his own entry.
In summary, Zhu Di can seize the initiative, and even if he behaves impolitely, there might be understandable reasons behind it.
But now, Zhu Di has lost this way. It is inappropriate to bring up family matters in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.
If Zhu Di forcefully uses this as an excuse, it is unlikely that Zhu Yunwen will listen, and the officials in the court will not easily accept it either.
Zhu Di, For the first time, discovered that his nephew seemed different from before.
The court officials, including some nobles and aristocrats such as Xu Huizu, Li Jinglong, and Geng Bingwen, were all looking at disrespectful Zhu Di. Their expressions were filled with anger, but their eyes were shifting, indicating that they were contemplating something.
Xie Jin withdrew his foot that was about to step forward. The silence in this situation had a more powerful effect than any words spoken.
Indeed, the hall fell into silence.
No one spoke another word.
They all stood there, staring at Zhu Di.
The wordless silence made the entire space feel oppressive, and this pressure continued to erode Zhu Di’s resolve.
Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui were already trembling.
If their father refuses to bow to the emperor today, the best outcome for the three of them would be to hold hands with Zhu Di and find a place to farm.
As for the worst outcome, the three of them dare not even imagine.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di, and Zhu Di looked at Zhu Yunwen.
They engaged in a silent showdown.
Zhu Di could clearly see the constant smile at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth, but there was a coldness, a ruthless coldness, in his eyes. He couldn’t help but recall that not long ago, Zhu Yunwen had appointed Ping An, Qu Neng, and others to enter Beiping and its surroundings.
The situation has changed, and Zhu Di finds himself with no way out.
Zhu Di lowers his head, takes a deep breath, slowly kneels down, and prostrates himself on the ground. He exclaims, “Your subject Zhu Di, pay his respects to Your Majesty.”
Reclutant!
But he cannot refuse to bow!
Zhu Di endured it!
He carefully concealed his desire for imperial power.
He knelt today so that he wouldn’t have to kneel in the future!
As Zhu Di knelt, the whole court breathed a sigh of relief, and the atmosphere gradually eased.
The smile at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth disappeared, and his expression turned serious.
Zhu Di is a great man, capable of bending and stretching, and skilled in deception and performance.
He may kneel with his legs, but his heart remains unyielding.
“You may rise.”
Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and spoke in a cold tone, looking at Zhu Di and the others as they stood up. He said, “At the time of Taizu’s passing, I was solely focused on following the imperial edict, neglecting the familial bond within the royal family, which resulted in the delayed return of the King of Yan for mourning in the capital. This was my fault.”
“Your Majesty, the instruction from Taizu for the kings to stay in their respective fiefdoms and not come to the capital is unrelated to you. It is inappropriate to solely attribute the fault to you. I implore Your Majesty to retract your statement.”
Fang Xiaoru quickly exclaimed.
Upon seeing Zhu Yunwen taking the initiative and assuming the blame for the oversight, thereby preempting any further inquiries regarding the obstruction of mourning, Zhu Di realized that pressing the matter further would make him appear petty. Thus, he was forced to change his stance and said, “Academician Fang’s words are correct. Although I have grievances, I dare not defy the intentions of Emperor Taizu. Since it is Emperor Taizu’s decree, I shall abide by it.”
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “Wrong is wrong, a ruler who dares not admit their mistakes and confront them cannot effectively govern the world. I reflect on myself three times a day and understand a principle: for minor mistakes, they can be corrected; for moderate mistakes, they can be rectified; but for major mistakes, they cannot be easily forgiven…”
The four words “cannot be easily forgiven” resonated in Zhu Di’s ears, causing him to tremble. He looked up and saw Zhu Yunwen staring at him.
Is this a warning to him, telling him to turn back?
“I hope everyone will reflect diligently, and encourage open discussions, and if I have made any mistakes, you may submit written reports for me to review. However, I require one thing: I do not need hearsay and baseless accusations. I need solid evidence and valid arguments. Let us put an end to such matters that lack substance and are driven by personal agendas.”
The words of Zhu Yunwen energized the court.
Especially for the officials who had survived the Hongwu reign, they finally breathed a sigh of relief. This meant that the Emperor would no longer resort to punishing officials without reason, nor would he allow anyone’s malicious schemes to result in indiscriminate punishment.
Zhu Di silently nodded upon hearing Zhu Yunwen’s words.
This nephew indeed possesses some tactics when it comes to governance.
The meetings in court gradually shifted away from focusing on Zhu Di and turned to trivial matters of little significance. After the court session, Zhu Di entered the Qianqing Palace to pay respects to Empress Dowager Lu.
The Hall of Great Accomplishment, King of Zhongshan’s Mansion.
Zhu Di arrived slowly in his carriage, and outside the King of Zhongshan’s Mansion, Duke Wei, Xu Huizu, Deputy Commander of Central Army, Xu Yingxu, Left commander of Right Army, Xu Zengshou, The three individuals had been waiting for a long time to welcome him.
Xu Da was the foremost military general of the Hongwu era. To consolidate his relationship with Xu Da, Zhu Yuanzhang arranged for Zhu Di to marry Xu Da’s eldest daughter, Xu Yihua.
As the son-in-law of Xu Da, it was necessary for the King of Yan to pay a visit to the King of Zhongshan’s Mansion and meet his brother-in-law, Xu Huizu. After all, At this time, Xu Huizu held the highest military rank and was considered the most distinguished military general.
Although Zhu Di enjoyed a prominent position in Beiping Prefecture, he was still far from the central government. If he didn’t establish strong connections, In the event that the emperor wanted to take action against him one day, without even having someone to deliver a message, that would be disastrous.
Whether it is for the sake of family relations or for his own future considerations, Zhu Di needs to come.
The carriage came to a stop, and Zhu Di stepped out from it.
Xu Huizu and others approached and bowed in salute.
Zhu Di quickly stopped them and said, “No need for so many formalities, my little brothers-in-law.”
Xu Huizu maintained a cold expression and persisted in performing the formalities. He then said, “Your Highness, upon your return to the capital, it is proper to observe the proper protocols. If the Xu family does not perform the appropriate greetings, wouldn’t it be a breach of etiquette?”
The pupils of Zhu Di’s eyes slightly constricted. Xu Huizu’s words seemed to praise Zhu Di for being courteous, but in reality, they were reproachful words. Xu Huizu was admonishing him for not kneeling and paying respects during the morning court for a prolonged period, indicating a lack of proper etiquette.
Unexpectedly, after not seeing each other for over three years, his little brother-in-law didn’t give him any face upon their meeting.
It seems that his heart has already been given to Zhu Yunchen.
Unable to compete!
Zhu Di made an internal judgment.
“Big Brother, it’s not easy for Brother-in-law to come to the capital. Now that he’s visiting our family, there’s no need to be so serious. Brother-in-law, please come in quickly.”
Xu Zengshou, seeing that the atmosphere is a bit awkward, quickly spoke up.
Xu Huizu glared fiercely at his younger brother, his face slightly darkened. However, Zhu Di paid no attention and smiled faintly as he entered the residence. After paying respects at the family’s ancestral temple, he proceeded to the main hall.
Zhu Di arranged for people to bring the gifts intended for Xu Family from Xu Yihua into residence, in place of Xu Yihua, he inquired about their well-being and gave them warm greetings. reminding them to take care of their health and other such concerns.
“By the way, why isn’t the fourth sister present?” Zhu Di inquired.
The corner of Xu Huizu’s mouth twitched slightly, but he ultimately didn’t say anything.
Xu Zengshou, on the other hand, was more proactive and said, “Brother-in-law, Miaojin is currently at the Imperial Academy and has been quite busy lately. She might not be able to take time off.”
“Imperial Academy?”
Zhu Di was taken aback.
Zhu Di was not aware of such a minor matter.
“Suddenly hearing that Xu Miaojin has entered the Imperial Academy, Zhu Di couldn’t help but feel astonished. After all, how could Zhu Di doesn’t knows what kind of place the Imperial Academy is, how could a mere young woman be allowed to mess around!”
“His Majesty entrust Miaojin to enter the Imperial Academy as Chief of Education to look for talents….”
Xu Zengshou chuckled and his gaze was full of mockery regarding this appointment.
Although Xu Zengshou cares for his younger sister, but Xu Miaojin is still young at the age of eighteen. As a young girl, how could she possibly understand the meaning of talent?
This appointment by the Emperor is simply absurd.
There was a hint of unusual brilliance in Zhu Di’s eyes. this nephew of his was bold and audacious, repeatedly defying the will of the founding emperor and going against the ancestral teachings. Perhaps this matter could be manipulated to his advantage…

Chapter 18: Zhu Di understands Marketing and Public Relations
Zhu Di did not stay long in the Xu family, as he hastily left without even having a meal due to Xu Huizu’s indifferent attitude. This incident left Xu Zengshou somewhat dissatisfied with Xu Huizu
After Zhu Di left, Xu Zengshou returned to his room and looked directly at Xu Huizu, asking, “Elder brother, brother-in-law is our family, can’t you treat him well?”
Xu Huizu coldly stared at Xu Zengshou and said, “Remember this, you must not get too close to the King of Yan!”
“Why? Are we not even allowed to interact with our own family members?” Xu Zengshou asked discontentedly.
Xu Huizu shook his head and sternly warned, “Don’t you know that he refused to bow at the court today? If it wasn’t for the pressure from the emperor, do you think he would have bowed? If it wasn’t for the emperor’s rearrangement of the defense in Beiping Prefecture, do you think he would have bowed? Remember this, his ambition is enough to bring disaster upon the Xu family!”
Xu Zengshou, seeing Xu Huizu becoming more agitated as he spoke, quickly lowered his head and listened to the admonition. He then said, “Elder brother is right, I will follow your arrangements.”
Xu Huizu, knowing that Xu Zengshou had always been close to Zhu Di, saw that he had taken the warning seriously and didn’t say anything further.
Nowadays, Xu Huizu no longer has much energy to manage the Xu family because the new military policy is steadily progressing. This is the most crucial matter for Xu Huizu to establish himself in the court and gain the recognition of Zhu Yunwen.
As long as the new military policy is successfully implemented, Xu Huizu believes that even if Zhu Di or the nine border kings join forces, they would not be a match for the Capital army.
From ancient times to the Ming Dynasty, soldiers only served for the sake of receiving pay and rations from the emperor. In other words, they were merely fighting to survive.
But things are different now!
These soldiers will possess unwavering beliefs and a noble faith in protecting and defending the Great Ming Empire.
They are the most formidable soldiers in the hands of Zhu Yunwen. They will burn themselves for the future of the empire, even if it means turning into bricks and tiles!
“The Art of War” by Sun Tzu highlights the six aspects: “as swift as the wind, as gentle as the forest, as fierce as fire, as immovable as a mountain, as elusive as a shadow, and as sudden as thunder.” However, it primarily emphasizes the soldiers’ physical qualities such as speed, bravery, loyalty, and uniformity, rather than placing a significant emphasis on their thoughts and mindset.
Zhu Yunwen creatively incorporated ideological development and introduced a series of innovative methods for training new soldiers, which surprised Xu Huizu. After undergoing the training, everyone was dripping with sweat, indicating that although the training content was simple, it was extremely physically demanding.
Not only that, but Zhu Yunwen also ordered the improvement of the food for the Capital Garrison and established a department called “Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau,” specifically responsible for managing the affairs of the families of capital garrison soldiers.
If a soldier or their family member fell seriously ill, the emperor would provide fifty percent of the medical expenses.
If a soldier’s family member is assaulted by a landlord, or if their land is occupied, or if they get involved in a lawsuit, there’s no need to panic. They can directly find the Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau, and the bureau will take responsibility for handling the matter.
If the Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau is unable to resolve the issue, it can be escalated to Five Army Commandery.
If even the Five Army Commandery cannot handle the situation, it can be reported to the emperor through a formal report.
In summary, soldiers are the soldiers of the emperor, the soldiers of the Ming Empire. The families of the soldiers should enjoy the benefits and honor that come with their connection to the army.
Even if a soldier dies on the battlefield, the empire will provide generous compensation. In addition to a one-time payment of twenty taels of silver or twenty stones of rice, a continuous subsidy will be given for a period of ten years. Every year, the soldier’s family will receive a subsidy of five taels of silver or five stones of rice.
Such a system naturally encountered resistance from the Ministry of Revenue. After all, compared to the previous system where the family of a deceased soldier received a one-time payment of thirty-six taels of silver or thirty-six stone of rice, the subsequent expenses were essentially negligible.
It is unknown what methods the emperor used to convince Huang Zicheng and others to accept this new system.
Nowadays, almost every soldier in the Capital garrison is willing to risk their lives for Zhu Yunwen. If Zhu Di lacks foresight and truly harbors ulterior motives, his fate will be extremely tragic.
Xu Hui understands the power’s new military policy, which is why he is more concerned about Zhu Di. His coldness towards Zhu Di is not only a warning to him but also a display of loyalty to Zhu Yunwen.
Currently, Zhu Yunwen has clearly changed his initial attitude and trusts Xu Huizu more. In the past month alone, Xu Huizu has been summoned to the palace more than ten times, while the Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, hasn’t been summoned once.
Even the new military policy did not involve Li Jinglong.
The implications behind this are something Xu Hui can still comprehend.
Just as Xu Hui was lost in thought, the door was pushed open and Xu Miaojin hurriedly entered the room. She called out to Xu Huizu, “Elder brother, where is my big brother-in-law?”
Xu Huizu frowned as he looked at his younger sister and said, “Why did you come back home instead of searching for talents at the Imperial Academy?”
Xu Miaojin rubbed her temples and replied, “Finding talented individuals is extremely difficult. Up until now, I haven’t found a single person. When I heard that my big brother-in-law had returned, I wanted to seek his advice and ask him what kind of scholar is considered talented. Where is he?”
“He has gone back,” replied Xu Hui.
Xu Hui responded casually.
Xu Miaojin glanced at the sun. It was lunchtime, so why did her big brother-in-law go back already? Could it be that we are short of food? That couldn’t be right. After all, elder brother was Duke of Wei and received a substantial income every year…
“The King of Yan has been feeling a bit weary lately, so he went back early to rest. Didn’t you want someone to give you advice, I can give you advice.”
Xu Huizu felt somewhat frustrated. His sister had gone to the Imperial Academy, but despite not causing any trouble, she hadn’t fulfilled the task assigned to her by Zhu Yunwen. Not only could she not find ten talented individuals, she couldn’t even find one.
There was no one willing to accept Xu Miaojin’s test.
The scholars at the Imperial Academy carried arrogance and prejudice deep in their bones. When they saw that the person assessing them was a female official, they either avoided her or pretended to be ignorant when questioned. No matter how she tried to test them, they simply ignored her.
This made it extremely difficult for Xu Miaojin to make any progress. In desperation, she sought help from Xu Huizu for some advice, but Xu Huizu always said that she had to rely on her own wisdom.
Xu Miaojin rolled her eyes in frustration. If she had the wisdom, why would she need to seek his help?
During this challenging time, when Xu Miaojin heard that her brother-in-law Zhu Di had returned, she hurried back to seek his advice, only to be disappointed.
Xu Hui had no solution and could only ask Xu Miaojin, “What kind of person did the Emperor ask you to find?”
“Talented individuals,” Xu Miaojin replied without hesitation.
“Then what is considered talented?” Xu Hui asked.
Xu Miaojin suddenly felt bewildered.
Indeed, what is considered talented?
Xu Hui sighed and said, “In the book ‘Discussive Weighing: Annoyances and Vexations[1]Lunheng 論衡 “Discussive Weighing” is a philosophical treatise written by the Later Han period 後漢 (25-220) scholar Wang Chong 王充.,’ it is mentioned that ‘the superiority or inferiority of talents cannot be judged equally.’ In ‘Baopuzi[2]The Baopuzi 抱朴子 “Master embracing simplicity”, occasionally written 抱樸子, is a Daoist treatise written by the Jin period 晉 (265-420) … Continue reading: The Rusticating People,’ it states ‘praise the virtuous and value morality, delight in nurturing talented individuals.’ And in ‘Shitong[3]Shitong 史通 “All about historiography” is one of China’s oldest books containing a systematic critique to historiography. It was written by … Continue reading: Narrative,’ it says, ‘Hence, we know that talents differ, their distances like this, how can we compare their merits, can they be of the same generation?’ From this, it can be seen that talented individuals refer to those who possess abilities and knowledge.”
“Those who can enter the Imperial Academy for study do have some knowledge. But if we look at the court as a whole, who doesn’t possess knowledge? The question is, having knowledge, do they also have abilities and the capability to accomplish things?”
“When faced with a problem, a talented individual is someone who can identify the root cause, find solutions, and prevent similar issues from occurring again. On the other hand, those who can only talk about the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, benevolence, righteousness, and morality without offering any practical solutions are mediocre talents!”
“Since you’re looking for talented individuals, I’ll give you two suggestions. The first one is…”
Upon hearing Xu Huizu’s words, Xu Miaojin’s eyes widened, nodding repeatedly, rubbing her hands together in excitement. She exclaimed, “I knew it, brother, you’re always the best to me!”
Xu Huizu smiled and sent Xu Miaojin back to the Imperial Academy. He himself went to the vital military area of the Capital garrison, cooperating with Tie Xuan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, to implement various policies and promote new training methods for the soldiers.
Meanwhile, Zhu Di, after leaving the King of Zhongshan’s residence, didn’t return to the King of Yan’s mansion. Instead, he visited other vassal king’s mansions, and he spend more than ten days either reconnecting with the kings or visiting nobles and ministers, such as Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, and Marquis of Wu Ding, Guo Ying.
Some people received him earnestly, treating him with great respect and giving him ample face.
Some people, on the other hand, dealt with him in a perfunctory manner, being cautious and merely going through the motions.
Nevertheless, Zhu Di treated everyone with courtesy.
What Zhu Di wanted was not just to be a guest, but rather, public opinion!
Prior to this, the people in Nanjing had heard rumors that Zhu Di “refused to pay respects to the Emperor” and “violated the rites of a vassal,” but it was only hearsay. Now, they saw Zhu Di walking through the streets, visiting old friends, receiving lavish hospitality, and displaying great affability. The previous rumors were completely shattered.
“If the King of Yan shows such courtesy to his guests, how can he possibly refuse to pay respects to the Emperor?”
“There must be malicious individuals spreading false accusations against the King of Yan.”
“The King of Yan is a man of loyalty and filial piety. He would never do such a thing.”
As a result, public opinion shifted, and the voices praising Zhu Di grew louder.
Zhu Yunwen sitting in the Wuying Hall, listened to Liu Changge’s report and couldn’t help but smile with delight.
He didn’t expect that Zhu Di was someone who understood self-promotion, self-marketing, and the creation of public opinion to expand his influence.
It must be said that Zhu Di’s public relations and marketing skills were quite effective.
Zhu Yunwen even received numerous memorial letters praising Zhu Di. Whether explicitly or implicitly, they all conveyed a message to Zhu Yunwen:
Zhu Di is the King of Yan. Although he didn’t give you a face during court sessions, don’t be angry. After all, the King of Yan is the leader of all the Kings, the supreme commander in the north. You must take action against him, for any disturbance caused by such an action would be catastrophic…
Among these memorials, some are from distinguished military generals, while others are from officials of lower ranks.
With intricate connections and intertwined roots, upon closer examination, without exception, they are all related to Zhu Di and share an extraordinary relationship.
“Has the Prince of Yan visited the King of Qiyang’s residence again?” 
Emperor Zhu Yuncheng squinted his eyes and asked.
Liu Changge nodded slightly and reported, “Yes.”
Zhu Yunwen lightly tapped the table and suddenly remembered something. He pulled out a memorial from the table and said softly, “The Governor of Guangdong has reported that the sea pirates are rampant and have repeatedly attacked various places in Guangzhou. This is indeed a major issue.”
Liu Changge remained silent.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the memorials praising Zhu Di and said to Liu Changge, “Compile a list of names for me. I have use for it.”
Liu Changge took the memorial and left.
August 1st.
Zhu Yunwen presided over the court and presented this seemingly insignificant memorial from Guangzhou. He addressed the ministers, saying, “Guangzhou has reported that there are numerous sea pirates in Yangjiang, Guanghai, Xinning, Wuchuan, Suixi, and other places. They are disturbing our territory and killing our people. Guangzhou has petitioned for assistance. I would like to hear the opinions of the ministers. Whom should we send to quell the unrest?”

Chapter 19: Deploying Great Duke to Suppress Sea Pirates.
The words of Zhu Yunwen left the members of the Grand Secretariat momentarily dumbfounded, They stared at each other with wide eyes and puzzled expressions.
Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin had all seen the report, and the content seemed, probably, should be, not as serious as the Emperor said.
They clearly stated:
“In the coastal areas, there are frequent activities of pirates, ranging from a few individuals to several hundred, causing constant disturbances. The Guangzhou Garrison, commanding three thousand soldiers, has conducted operations in Yangjiang, Guanghai, Xinning, Wuchuan, Suixi, and other areas. With a sacrifice of thirty lives and fifty injuries, they have successfully eliminated five hundred pirates.”
This seems to be a report of their achievements. How did it become a plea for assistance in the Emperor’s words?
Could it be that there’s some hidden motive?
With his quick thinking, Xie Jin understood the Emperor’s intention. He loudly exclaimed, “Your Majesty, Guangzhou is a crucial gateway in the southern part of the empire. It must not be lost. In my opinion, only a senior minister can handle this task.”
“Oh?”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin with satisfaction. This one of the Three Great Talents was indeed living up to his reputation.
“Minister Xie, who do you think is capable of shouldering this important responsibility?”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen asked with a smile.
Xie Jin was about to speak up, but suddenly realized that mentioning a particular name could potentially cause trouble. After all, although he had entered the Grand Secretariat, his foundation was still shallow compared to the powerful nobles.
Xie Jin bowed and said, “Your Majesty, this matter can be inquired with the Ministry of Personnel.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly, he understand that Xie Jin had seen through his intentions and was trying to be cunning. However, he didn’t mind and turned his gaze to Qi Tai, asking, “Minister Qi, who do you think is capable of shouldering this important responsibility?”
The Ministry of Personnel was responsible for recommending talented individuals.
Minister of Personnel, Qi Tai stepped forward and exclaimed, “I believe Marquis of An Lu, Wu Jie is capable of assuming this position.”
Zhu Yunwen frowned and said, “Marquis of An Lu is currently in charge of military training in Zhejiang and is also responsible for coastal defense. It may be difficult for him to spare his time.”
“How about Marquis of Jiang Yin, Wu Gao…”
“Wu Gao’s health has been poor recently…”
“What about Commander Gu Cheng…”
“I have other arrangements for Gu Cheng, it’s not suitable…”
Qi Tai successively recommended several individuals, but Zhu Yunwen rejected them all.
Qi Tai was not a fool either, at this time if he couldn’t figure it out, it’d be a waste of his officialdom.
Clearly, the emperor already had someone in mind, but due to his status, he couldn’t openly declare it himself. That’s why he sought recommendations from his subordinates, and when Xie Jin declined to suggest a candidate, he passed the ball to Qi Tai.
However, Qi Tai was bewildered. He had no idea whom the emperor intended to trap. Surely, it couldn’t be the King of Yan.
Nervously, Qi Tai glanced at Zhu Yunwen and saw that the emperor slightly turned his head toward the side of the military elite. Qi Tai followed his gaze and realized that the emperor seemed to be looking at the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu.
Wait!
Xu Huizu is currently busy training the new army in the capital and cannot be available for this task.
In that case, who else could it be?
Qi Tai widened his eyes, swallowed nervously, and steadied himself. Then he shouted loudly, “I believe that this matter is crucial for the peace and prosperity of our nation. It requires a formidable force to completely eradicate the sea pirates. The one who can handle such a momentous task and lead our Ming Dynasty’s expedition in the south is none other than Duke of Cao.”
Upon hearing his name being called, Li Jinglong, who was dozing off, suddenly trembled.
He had drunk too much last night and didn’t sleep well.
Could it be that he was experiencing auditory hallucinations?
Just as Li Jinglong was feeling a bit disoriented, Zhu Yunwen nodded in satisfaction and said, “Minister Qi’s words are correct. This will be the first battle since my ascension to the throne, and it must be ensured with utmost caution. It will showcase the might of our Ming army, protect our territories, and ensure the safety of our people. We must dispatch a senior minister for this task! In that case, Duke Cao!”
“Here I am!”
Li Jinglong quickly stepped forward and paid his respects.
“I appoint you as the Great General of pacifying the south, Li Zengzhi as the Commander-in-Chief, Xu Zengshou as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Li You, Xu Hong, Chen Yue… eight individuals as participating generals. Starting tomorrow, you will march to Guangzhou and join forces with the Guangzhou Commandery to eradicate the sea pirates and protect our Ming Dynasty!”
Zhu Yunwen stood up and shouted with authority.
No room for discussion!
No room for questioning!
The command of Zhu Yunwen left Li Jinglong feeling as if he had been struck by lightning. He numbly expressed his gratitude and accepted the order.
Inside the grand hall, officials whispered and discussed among themselves.
Using a Great Duke to suppress small pirates?
How serious is the situation with the Guangzhou pirates?
Isn’t this deployment giving too much face to those pirates?
Could it be that Guangzhou has already completely fallen?
They haven’t heard anything about it!
“Your Majesty, I believe that the Duke of Cao is a pillar of the empire and should not be easily deployed. Although Guangzhou is troubled by pirates, it is sufficient to mobilize a regional commander or a marquis to suppress the chaos.”
The Commander of the Capital Guard, Wang Zuo, stepped forward to voice his opposition.
“We concur,” several inconspicuous officials spoke up.
Zhu Yunwen coldly stared at the officials who opposed him and spoke sternly, “While the people of Guangzhou are trapped in turmoil, all of you are still deliberating over who should be deployed? Wang Zuo, if I send you, can you guarantee victory? I am well aware that without eliminating the pirates, Guangzhou and the stability of the empire will be at risk! As the Commander, don’t you understand this simple fact?”
“The Duke of Cao is someone I trust and he is also the heir of the King of Qiyang. With his military expertise, once he takes action, remarkable results will be achieved! He will thoroughly eradicate the pirates and secure a peaceful southern gateway for me. How dare you oppose, What are your ulterior motives?”
Wang Zuo, startled by Zhu Yunwen’s outburst, quickly knelt down and kowtowed.
If they continue to oppose, they are unsure of whether the pirates will be eradicated, but their own heads will surely be taken off.
Zhu Yunwen spoke sternly, “By appointing the Duke of Cao, I am sending a message to the world that I, for the safety of the empire and its people, am willing to use the Duke of Cao without hesitation! Even if the need arises, I myself can take the lead, don armor, and go into battle to kill the enemy! Duke of Cao, do you have the courage to thoroughly eradicate the pirates and share the burden with me?!”
Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, quickly knelt and shouted, “I have the courage and I am willing to share the burden for Your Majesty!”
At this point, if they don’t lower their heads, they will be finished.
The emperor has spoken, declaring that if no one else goes, he will personally lead the troops.
What choice does Li Jinglong have but to comply?
Who would dare let the new emperor from going to battle himself?
As a loyal subject, if he cannot share the emperor’s burdens, how can he continue to hold his position in the court?
Moreover, Zhu Yunwen expressed his trust and willingness to utilize the Duke and delivered a fervent speech filled with determination and a thirst for action. It was enough to make Li Jinglong willingly embark on the mission.
Zhu Yunwen after settling the matter with Li Jinglong, glanced at the officials who had opposed him and said, “Wang Zuo and others, follow the army in the expedition. Use your eyes and hearts to witness the suffering of the people affected by the disasters. Then come back and tell me whether my decision was right or wrong!”
The entire court was shocked.
Did opposition result in immediate conscription?
Isn’t that too harsh?
Although they weren’t going as frontline soldiers, following the army in the expedition still carried risks. The battlefield does not discriminate, and if the pirates were to attack, they might end up sacrificing themselves heroically.
In reality, Wang Zuo was more concerned about meeting a heroic fate on the way there.
From Nanjing to Guangzhou, there are approximately three thousand miles, and it would take at least two to three months to travel southward. What if he can’t adapt to the local environment? He could end up losing his life in the unfamiliar lands of the Great Ming.
Unfortunately, Wang Zuo’s plea had no effect.
Zhu Yunwen did not give him a chance.
After the court meeting ended, Zhu Yunwen left, and the officials smiled and looked at Li Jinglong.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin, with bowed hands, congratulated, “Upon the new emperor’s ascension, Duke of Cao has been entrusted in the first battle, showing that he has received great blessings from the heavens.”
Li Jinglong’s smile at the corners of his mouth appeared very unnatural.
Received great blessings from the heavens?
Why don’t I feel that at all?
Looking back now, why does it feel like being exiled to Guangzhou?
After accepting sincere or insincere congratulations from the ministers, Li Jinglong returned to King Qiyang’s residence in a state of confusion. He looked at his younger brother, Li Zengzhi, and suddenly asked, “It seems that all the arrangements made by the emperor are our people, right?”
Li Zengzhi frowned and thought for a moment before saying, “Except for Xu Zengshou, most of them are our people! Elder Brother, the arrangements this time, could it be that the Emperor has noticed something?”
Li Jinglong sighed and said, “That’s right. The Emperor has never taken action and remained oblivious to our interactions with the king of Yan. Hehe, I thought he was weak, but it turns out he has been concealing his strength! Our Emperor is not simple!”
Li Zengzhi felt somewhat frustrated and asked, “What should we do? Should we go to Guangzhou?”
Li Jinglong fell into contemplation.
During this period, the Li family had been building relationships with the King of Yan and the King of Ning. They were about to conclude the mourning period, and these vassal kings would soon depart. Li Jinglong had planned to bid them farewell with a heartfelt parting, hoping to meet again in the future.
Unexpectedly, before they could leave, he himself was now being sent away.
If he were to go to Guangzhou, it would mean that the Li family could not serve as support for the King of Yan, the King of Ning, and others.
Li Jinglong understood the principle of being unable to reach faraway goals.
Li Zengzhi didn’t think that far ahead and instead said, “Big brother, we have always wanted to become the foremost noble family, surpassing Xu Huizu. Now, perhaps this is an opportunity.”
“An opportunity? Don’t you think this is a trap?” Li Jinglong’s face turned cold.
Going to Guangzhou, such a distant place, would take at least half a year-round trip, or even up to a year.
If he doesn’t perform well, he might end up staying there for a long time, living his days at sea.
If he does a good job, and Zhu Yunwen is pleased, he might appoint him as the commander of the anti-piracy forces and have him stationed in Guangzhou to fight against the pirates for a long term. That would be the end of his life.
This is simply a massive trap, a treacherous trap that can cost us his lives.
Li Zengzhi smiled and said, “Big brother, don’t worry. The Emperor will never let us stay in Guangzhou for long, and even if we stay, it won’t be for long.”
“Why is that?” Li Jinglong looked at his younger brother in surprise.
Li Zengzhi chuckled, “Firstly if we successfully eliminate the pirates, it’s only natural to return triumphantly. Secondly, if the Emperor doesn’t allow us to return, we can always seek Empress Dowager’s intervention. And besides, isn’t there still the third son of the Xu family? If we don’t come back, can the third son of the Xu family come back? If he returns, then we have to return too, right?”
“The most important thing is that we just need to employ a little strategy. The Emperor will surely need us to go and return early. And when we return, the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, will be beneath you, big brother.”
Li Jinglong looked at Li Zengzhi curiously and asked, “What kind of strategy?”
Li Zengzhi leaned in close to Li Jinglong’s ear and whispered, “Confidentially report to the Emperor, claiming that the King of Ning and the King of Yan have ulterior motives.”
Li Jinglong stood up abruptly, pointing at Li Zengzhi, and angrily exclaimed, “How can we do such actions!”
“Brother, please calm down. The key point of what we will inform the emperor is not about the loyalty of the two kings, but rather the close relationship between Xu Huizu and the King of Yan. You must understand that they are relatives by marriage. If the King of Yan rebels, can the emperor trust Xu Huizu, who is the King of Yan’s brother-in-law? Can he entrust the imperial army to his command? Absolutely not!”
Li Zengzhi confidently looked at the contemplative Li Jinglong and added, “Brother, you must know that in the royal court, loyalty is of utmost importance, followed by abilities. Although we may not be as capable as Xu Huizu, if we can excel in loyalty, hehe…”
