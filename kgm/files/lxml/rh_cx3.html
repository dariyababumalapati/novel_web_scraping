   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    The city of Emden is a commercial port at the mouth of the Ems River. Although it is not a Hanseatic commercial city, it is still very prosperous because of its important location.
   </font>
  </font>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because the Ems River is a "long river" with a length of 371 kilometers (in European terms), even in later generations, its navigable distance was only 116 kilometers.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You know, that was in later generations, and shipping ships generally had a displacement of several thousand tons.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the Middle Ages, small boats of dozens of tons could be said to be shipping... Therefore, in this era, the navigable distance of the Ems River was almost 200 kilometers long...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     What is the concept of 200 kilometers?
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In this era of numerous vassals, 200 kilometers may pass through the borders of several vassal states...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Emden is located at the mouth of the Ems River and can be regarded as an important entrepot for German trade with overseas countries.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For example, Emden is also an important entrepot for British salt imports and an important import port for British woolen goods.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although it is far inferior to Hanseatic cities such as Bremen and Hamburg, compared with other cities, Emden is relatively prosperous.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The prosperous port also brought a lot of tax revenue to Emden.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     With taxes, there will naturally be money to strengthen the city walls...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the walls of Emden are tall and strong and difficult to conquer.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This was also one of the important reasons why the Saxon coalition was unable to capture the city later.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, in the 14th century, Emden belonged to the Abdena family, one of the 13 tribes of East Friesland.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, because Emden is so prosperous, it has attracted covetous attention.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, after the Ukena family usurped the throne, they also took it over.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The original home base of the Uckener family was in Lier County, which was the most agriculturally developed area in East Friesland.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the Ukena family has always been relatively powerful.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Relying on its developed agriculture, the Ukena family had the strength to overthrow the Bullock family and seize the wealthy Emden as the new capital.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, then the Serxner family, which was originally nestled in the small town of Norden on the North Sea, suddenly emerged and replaced the Uckener family and became the new controller of East Friesland.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Sekesner family also covets the prosperity of Emden, and still sets its capital here to enjoy the finance, taxation and prosperity here...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, the Sekesner family is quite prestigious in East Friesland.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At least, they are much better than the Ukena family, which is a rebellious family.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the beginning, they were able to seize East Friesland precisely because they took advantage of other tribes' dissatisfaction with the rebellious Ukena family and seized power.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After decades in business, Emden is now impregnable and difficult to conquer.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Among other things, in the war of 1516, the Duke of Saxony struggled with tens of thousands of troops and failed to capture Emden.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin didn't think he had horns on his head. In the wild, he was very confident that his Spanish phalanx could defeat the East Frisian army.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But Marin had no confidence at all when besieging the fortified city wall.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For this reason, he could only think of strange moves, otherwise it would be difficult to quickly conquer Emden...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At this time, Marin remembered the fall of Groningen. It seemed that a businessman named Mayer led 260 guards and wore armor to storm the gate of Groningen...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "The fortress is easiest to break into from the inside? It's really a good idea!"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, it is very difficult to replicate Mayer's miracle.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because Groningen is much more prosperous than Emden, and there are so many businessmen that it is possible to gather so many bodyguards to protect them.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In Emden, it&#8217;s hard to do that.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, with the lessons of Groningen, Edsad I will definitely take targeted precautions.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, if you want to copy the original version and use this method, it will definitely not work.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, Marin decided to modify the specific details...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin has watched war movies such as "Mine Warfare" and "Tunnel Warfare" since he was a child, and he likes the plots of them very much.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Most of the city walls in Europe are made of stone, which are extremely strong and cannot be blasted open by ordinary artillery.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is also difficult to imitate the Taiping Rebellion army's "carrying coffins" to blow up the city wall.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because the city walls blown up by the Taiping Army were basically made of bricks and not as strong as those made of stone.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, digging tunnels is a very good choice...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, Europe&#8217;s walls are tall and its foundations are deep.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, digging tunnels is also a very troublesome and laborious task.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because the tunnel needs to be dug very deep and the amount of work is too large.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, Marin is not in a hurry to attack Emden now.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, he did not need to dig a tunnel under the city wall in a short time.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     According to Marin's estimation, he has at least half a year to prepare.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And this period of time can be used to secretly dig tunnels...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, Marin decided to send a group of people to rent a courtyard outside Emden City, and then arrange for people to secretly dig tunnels into the city every day.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When the tunnel is almost completed, people will be sent to buy a house in the city and the tunnel entrance will be opened inside the house.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When Marin officially leads troops to attack the city, he can directly send an army. While the East Frisian army is not paying attention,  Reading
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     uuk&#65358;nshu Seize the city gate from the inside and enlarge the army into the city...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, this sneak attack must have happened at night.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, Marin's main army will definitely not attack the city blatantly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Under such circumstances, the East Frisians would certainly not go out of their way to block the city gate with stones or other objects.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because they didn't expect anyone to attack them.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, a small force that enters the city from the tunnel can simply seize the city gate, then unbolt the door from the inside and open the city gate, and then a large army can enter the city.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, before entering the city, Marin also planned to send spies to obtain the distribution map of the army's garrison and defense in the city, so that Marin's army could focus on interception and ensure that the count's family could be captured quickly...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     To this end, Marin specially sent two teams of spies to Emden.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     A team of professional spies were in the city, responsible for gathering information and purchasing a house inside the city walls to serve as the entrance to the tunnel.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The other team, except for the leader, is mainly composed of well diggers.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Under the leadership of the leader, they were responsible for digging tunnels into the interior of the city wall in the yard purchased outside the city wall.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It doesn&#8217;t need to be dug very fast, as long as it can be dug out within half a year.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, confidentiality is the top priority when it comes to digging tunnels.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, they needed to quietly transport the excavated soil out in batches in the middle of the night to avoid being discovered by the East Frisian army.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Otherwise, it will be in vain...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As long as this tunnel is opened, then Marin's army can attack the city as quickly as possible.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then, with superior strength and tactics, the defenders were eliminated and the entire family of Edsad I was captured...
    </font>
