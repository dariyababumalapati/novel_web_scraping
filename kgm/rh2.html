   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    Under Marin's arrangement, Prince Philip entertained the Teutonic knights in the city in Königsberg for many days.
   </font>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    In addition to the Teutonic Knights belonging to the Westphalia-Rhineland Alliance, knights from other regions were also invited.
   </font>
  </font>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For example, Teutonic knights from Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Bohemia, Silesia, Pomerania, and Prussia were also invited.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although, the number and scale of the Teutonic Knights in these areas cannot keep up with the three major forces of Franconia-Swabia League, Westphalia-Rhineland League and Saxony.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, a little adds up.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The total number of these scattered Teutonic Knights is still considerable.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For several days, Marin invited the Teutonic knights from the Westphalia-Rhineland region in Königsberg many times and in batches. At the same time, he also entertained knights from other neutral regions.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In short, Marin tried his best to invite them as long as they were not the Teutonic Knights of the archrival Franconian-Swabian Alliance and the Teutonic Knights of the direct competitor Saxony.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After inviting all the Teutonic Knights in Königsberg, Marin and Prince Philip rushed to other cities in the Teutonic Knights Kingdom.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Especially the Hanseatic cities - Elbing (Elblag), Torn (Torun) and Mermel (Klaipeda) - entertained and wooed the local Teutonic knights.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, in name, the Teutonic Knights are more than just these four Hanseatic cities.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, the other three Hanseatic cities originally directly under the Teutonic Knights - Danzig, Marienburg and Kulm - were annexed by Poland after the Battle of Tannenberg and the "Thirteen Years' War".
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the Teutonic Knights Kingdom, which originally had 7 directly subordinate Hanseatic cities, only had 4 Hanseatic cities left.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The Livonian Knights, which nominally belongs to the Teutonic Knights, actually controls Dorpat (Tartu), Filin (Viljandi), Reval (Tallinn), and Pernau (Parnu). , Riga, a total of 5 Hanseatic cities.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, since the Battle of Tannenberg, the Teutonic Knights began to decline, and the Livonian Knights began to be less obedient.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although it still belongs to the Teutonic Knights in name, it is actually semi-independent.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even the Grand Master of the Livonian Knights was elected by the local Livonian Knights and had nothing to do with the Teutonic Knights.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, the Livonian Knights do not need to pay taxes to the Teutonic Knights. Only when the Teutonic Knights are attacked by the Polish-Lithuanian Alliance can they send troops to help.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the current economic lifeline of the Teutonic Knights country is actually mainly the four remaining Hanseatic cities - Königsberg, Elbing, Thon and Mermel.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The main formal knights of the Teutonic Knights, the knights are mainly distributed in these four Hanseatic cities and nearby.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because these four Hanseatic cities are the main source of tax revenue for the Teutonic Knights and are also the economic lifeline.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the more than 800 official Teutonic Knights are basically distributed in these four cities and surrounding areas.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin continued to launch a food and drink offensive, conquering a large number of Teutonic knights with Chinese food that far exceeded the dark medieval cuisine.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     They first went to Elbing and Torn in the southwest, and finally, Marin and Prince Philip came to the Hanseatic port city of Memel on the Baltic Sea coast in the north of the Teutonic Knights...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The management of the Teutonic Knights is different from that of other countries. They do not appoint local officials, but adopt a regimental leader system.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Generally, branches of the Teutonic Knights will be established in each region.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The one who controls the local area is also the branch leader of the local Teutonic Knights.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And these branch leaders are all official Teutonic Knights, sent down by Königsberg.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For example, the sub-head of the Teutonic Knights in Mermel is a Teutonic Knight of Swiss origin, Amsau, who was arranged by the previous grand head.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Elbing's branch leader is a Saxon, and Thorn's branch leader is a Rhinelander...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, this is not important.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because, at the Grand Master Election Conference, no matter if they are branch leaders or ordinary formal Teutonic Knights, each person only has one vote of suffrage.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, when Marin wins over those formal Teutonic Knights, he doesn't care much about the specific position. He only cares about whether you are an official Teutonic Knight.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, Marin will not offend the branch leaders, lest they secretly cause harm.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In Memel, Marin walked through the streets and visited the official Teutonic Knights. Not only did he treat them to a feast, he also secretly gave them gold coins.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Gold coins are usually carried in small bags, and there are only a few dozen gold coins in one generation.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, it is not too little.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You know, since the decline of the Teutonic Knights, life has not been easy for the Teutonic Knights.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, within the country of the Teutonic Knights, there was also the Prussian Alliance formed by local Prussian nobles and citizens, which colluded with Poland.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the economy of the Teutonic Knights country began to decline, and the life of the knights was not easy.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, although a small bag of gold coins cannot make them rich, it can make them live a lot better.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Just like in later generations, someone gives you tens of thousands of dollars. Although it is not enough for you to buy a house or a car, it is enough to make you live a longer life...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     One day, Marin and Prince Philip were riding horses on the streets of Mermel, preparing to visit a Teutonic knight of Austrian origin who was very influential in the area. When they passed by a pharmacy, they saw a man walking out of it. , a middle-aged man dressed as a knight, holding a bag of medicine in his hand...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At first, Marin just glanced at it casually, but he was quickly attracted to the middle-aged man...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because, Marin always felt that this face was familiar.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     So, he couldn't help but ride his horse to follow...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After following for a while, the middle-aged man who looked a little decadent seemed to be irritated. He turned around suddenly, pulled out part of his sword, and said angrily:
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Who are you? Why are you following me?"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Uh...well...this gentleman, I just think you look familiar..." Marin scratched his head, but he didn't know how to explain it.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, if you have a big girl behind you, you can still say that your hormones are excessive, but if you have an uncle behind you, how do you explain it to Marin?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The middle-aged man was also stunned for a moment. He looked at Prince Philip carefully and found that he was not impressed.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then, he looked at Marin carefully...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As a result, the middle-aged man was also a little stunned.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because he also felt vaguely familiar with Marin, as if he had seen him somewhere...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Excuse me, are you a knight from Westphalia?" The middle-aged man thought for a moment and thought that Marin might be a knight from his hometown, or a descendant of an acquaintance.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You know, the country of the Teutonic Knights is the longing place for many wandering knights in the German region.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     So it's not surprising that there are some wandering knights from the home region.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although Marin was well dressed, he did not wear the long-distance running silk that symbolized his aristocratic status. Instead, he dressed more like a knight.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Similarly, in order to get close to the Teutonic Knights, Prince Philip did not wear silk for long-distance running. Instead, like Marin, he wore a knight's attire, which made it impossible for middle-aged people to judge the origin.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Yes, we are indeed knights from the Westphalia area. Where are you from, sir?" Marin was a little surprised. Could it be that he met a fellow countryman?
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But why does Mao have a very familiar feeling?
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Well, I am a wandering knight from the Mark Country. I have been here for many years..." The middle-aged man nodded and replied.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Uncle Mark? It can't be such a coincidence, right?" Prince Philip and Marin looked at each other, what a coincidence...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "What a coincidence, we are both from Count Mark..." Prince Philip's father and brother are both Earl Mark...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "May I ask your surname?" Marin felt that he had forgotten something, but there was only a layer of veil between them.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "My name is Jules Hofmann, from Bochum, Counties of Mark..."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Boom-" Marin's head suddenly exploded...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "His name is Yule... His name is Yule... Nima, is he the uncle that my father asked me to find?"
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin was stunned for a moment, not knowing how to deal with it...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Hoffmann? Your surname is Hoffmann too? And you are from Bochum? What a coincidence. This friend of mine also has the surname of Hoffmann and is also from Bochum..." Prince Philip suddenly became interested...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Really?" At this time, the middle-aged knight also became interested.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     He thought about it and suddenly his expression changed...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Could it be...that you are little Marin? Have you also wandered to the Teutonic Knights country?" Julle Hoffman suddenly thought of this possibility.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because he left home 18 years ago.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When he left home, Marin had been born and was already 1 year old.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Now, counting the time, Marin is over 18 years old.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     According to the tradition of the Hoffman family, it's time to be kicked out of the house...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Uh...Uncle Yule, I'm Marin...but I didn't wander to the Teutonic Knights, I came here to do business..."
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Doing business? Could it be that...little Marin, you have taken refuge in this gentleman? Have you become his follower?" Jüle Hoffman obviously didn't know what was happening in Germany, let alone Marin's prestigious reputation.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At first, he thought that Marin, like him, came to the country of the Teutonic Knights to pursue his dreams.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, Marin said that he was not a wandering knight.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then, in Yule's eyes, there was only one possibility left - that is, Marin had taken refuge with a certain nobleman and became a guard knight.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As it happened, Prince Philip had the aura of a superior person, and he was followed by a group of guards.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     So Yule guessed that Marin was following Prince Philip...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for Marin himself, because he was born in Diaosi in his previous life, even though his identity has changed dramatically after time travel.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, many habits from the past life are difficult to change, and the temperament is also very unreliable.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, Marin lacks the arrogance that ordinary nobles have.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even though he was middle-aged and had met many people, Yule didn't see any aura of superiority in Marin.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, Marin was sadly treated as a little follower by his uncle...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Follower... How the hell do I look like a follower?" Marin also choked at his uncle's words.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     So much so, that the excitement of discovering a long-lost relative was so overwhelming...
