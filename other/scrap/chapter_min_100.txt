Chapter 51: Autumn White Dew, Merchants Who Value Coins over Banknotes
Jiangdong Gate, connecting to Shuixi Gate in the east and Shangxin River in the west, served as the southwest commercial center of the capital.
Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, and Zhu Geng, the King of Min, along with a few attendants, strolled into the South Street of the west gate of Jiangdong Gate, looking at the bustling scene. They exchanged a smile and extended their hands in agreement, saying, “After you,” before walking together into the hustle and bustle.
Among the sixteen towers in Jinling, there were five located in Jiangdong Gate: Qingyan Tower, Cuiliu Tower, Meijian Tower, Danfen Tower, and Jiangdong Tower. These grand and spacious buildings with high eaves attracted elegant scholars and distinguished guests, creating a lively atmosphere.
Many literati and poets gathered here to enjoy drinking, revelry, and express their creativity, leaving behind excellent works.
Leisurely observing the towers, adorned screens and unfolding elegance,
Jade wrists sweeping red sleeves, jade cups brimming with green wine.
Varied scenes intertwine, vanishing amidst ethereal dust.
Today’s boisterous singing guests, fine-tuning new poetry.
(郡楼闲纵目，风度锦屏开。
玉腕揎红袖，琼卮泛绿醅。
参差凌倒景，迢遁绝浮埃。
今日狂歌客，新诗且细裁。)
This is a poetic description of the Qingyan Tower and Danfen Tower.
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng stood on the street, with Qingyan Tower on their left and Danfen Tower on their right.
“Fifteenth Brother, which one shall we go to?”
Zhu Geng hesitated.
Zhu Zhi assessed the two tall towers and said, “Zhao girl, intoxicated by wine, flips her song and dampens her fan, while Yan Ji’s fragrance permeates her delicate dance skirt. Let’s first take a look at this Qingyan Tower.”
Inside the Qingyan Tower, a group of graceful women accompany the two kings. They delicately persuade them to drink from time to time. Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng ordered more than a dozen types of alcoholic beverages and tasted them one by one. The innkeeper stood by, wearing a smile, serving them attentively.
During the Ming Dynasty, wine reached its peak, surpassing the Han, Tang, and Song Dynasties.
Although commerce was not well-developed during the early Ming Dynasty, the business of taverns and wine shops was quite active.
The most favored wine among the people of the capital during the early Ming Dynasty was Zhejiang yellow wine. Although there were some instances of distilled spirits emerging in certain regions, they had not yet become mainstream. The wine varieties of the Ming Dynasty were numerous, including Jinhua wine, Autumn White Dew, Wuxiang distilled spirit, Junxun wine, Jingzhi high-proof liquor, ginger wine, fennel wine, mung bean wine, bamboo leaf wine, and more.
Jingzhi high-proof liquor and Autumn White Dew were relatively strong distilled spirits, and they had a whitish color.
On the other hand, Wuxiang distilled spirit was brewed using ingredients such as sandalwood, camphor, benzoin, cloves, and glutinous rice. Looking at these ingredients, people from later generations might lose their interest and even question whether it was drinking wine or cooking wine.
However, at that time, Wuxiang distilled spirit was hailed as the “number one wine in Jiangnan” and was associated with the “delight of a gentle spring breeze.”
Zhu Zhi held a glass of Wuxiang distilled spirit, which had a somewhat turbid color. After drinking it, he felt a mild warmth inside his body. He let out a breath and slowly exhaled, praising, “Good wine!”
Zhu Geng nudged the Autumn White Dew next to him and said to Zhu Zhi, “This wine should be good.”
After tasting a few sips, Zhu Zhi felt a slight warmth in his body. He nodded earnestly and asked the owner, “How is this Autumn White Dew sold?”
“Dear guests, Autumn White Dew is available in three grades: upper, middle, and lower. For the lower grade, it would be five mace of silver. However, for the middle grade, it would be two taels of silver. As you are esteemed guests and tasting the finest Autumn Dew White, the cost would be five taels of silver.” The owner replied with a smile.[1]Tl’s note: 1 Guan is 1000 mace, 1 tael is 10 maces.
Zhu Zhi nodded slightly, considering the price to be reasonable at Qingyan Tower. However, five taels of silver would be manageable for personal consumption, but if they were to make a large purchase, they would have to tighten their belts and live frugally.
“You go and bring out the middle and lower-grade Autumn Dew White for us to taste,” Zhu Geng suddenly said.
Zhu Zhi was taken aback, feeling a bit embarrassed. He looked at Zhu Geng with a frustrated expression, thinking to himself, “Little brother, we are vassal kings. Should we be bargaining over the price? It’s fine if you embarrass yourself, but why are you dragging me along?”
The owner of the establishment was also bewildered by this peculiar request. Those who frequented Qingyan Tower were either wealthy merchants or noble children, talented scholars who always sought better things. They had never encountered anyone who wanted something of lower quality.
These two were quite unique.
Nevertheless, the owner maintained their composure and forced a smile, arranging for the requested wines to be brought out.
Zhu Zhi looked at the poured middle and lower-grade Autumn White Dew and shook his head, resolutely refusing to drink it.
Zhu Geng lifted his wine cup, looked at Zhu Zhi, and said casually, “If we can’t fulfill the tasks assigned to us, the two of us will have to answer for it right here.”
Zhu Zhi’s teeth felt sour, and he reluctantly raised his wine cup to taste it. His eyes brightened and he looked at Zhu Geng, nodding and saying, “This one is good, haha.”
The owner stood by with a forced smile, a hint of disdain in his eyes.
These two individuals had no discernment, unable to differentiate between good and bad wine. It was truly baffling how they could wear luxurious garments and jade belts.
Jade belts?
The owner’s pupils slightly narrowed, and a respectful smile appeared on his face.
The belt was an important part of ceremonial attire, and there were specific regulations on which belt should be worn by officials according to their rank.
Emperor Taizu attached great importance to ceremonial attire. In the third, fourteenth, and twenty-sixth years of the Hongwu reign, he made three revisions to the regulations, requiring officials of civil and military ranks to wear specific belts: first-grade officials wore jade or patterned belts, second-grade officials wore rhinoceros belts, third and fourth-grade officials wore golden lychee belts, and those below the fifth grade wore black horn belts.
If anyone wore the wrong belt or violated the rules, a third-grade official daring to wear a jade belt, for example, would likely lose not only their belt but also their head.
Seeing that both individuals were wearing jade belts despite being in casual attire, it indicated that they were either first-grade officials or Kings.
The owner trembled slightly, wondering why these two distinguished gentlemen had come here.
If something went wrong, Qingyan Tower would likely cease to exist.
“This lower-grade Autumn Dew White is good. However, one jar of wine costing five maces of silver is still a bit expensive.”
Zhu Zhi calculated in his mind.
If they were to make a large purchase, one jar of wine would cost five maces of silver. It would amount to one thousand five hundred taels for three thousand jars. If they wanted ten thousand jars, it would reach five thousand taels. The expenditure would be substantial.
“Hehe, if you both like it, our shop can offer a discount. One jar for two maces of silver. We really can’t go any lower,” the owner replied with a smile.
The owner was in a dilemma. Two maces of silver were already the cost price, and any lower would mean they would have to bear the cost themselves.
“Haha, we’re not taking much advantage of you either. How about this: three maces, and I want ten thousand jars. What do you think?” Zhu Zhi said with a smile.
The owner widened their eyes. This was a significant deal. Although the profit margin would be lower, the quantity made up for it. If that’s the case, they could still make a decent profit. However…
“Our humble shop cannot provide ten thousand jars at the moment. How about three thousand jars for now? After three months, no, two months, we will deliver another three thousand jars to your residence. How does that sound?” the owner quickly suggested.
Zhu Zhi nodded slightly and took out a stack of banknotes from his sleeve, saying, “Here is three hundred guan as a down payment. You only need to deliver these three thousand jars of wine outside the Xi’an Gate.”
Upon hearing the mention of the Xi’an Gate, the owner was taken aback. Could it be that this batch of goods was procured by the imperial palace?
As the owner looked at the banknotes placed on the table by Zhu Zhi, their brows slightly furrowed. They respectfully bowed and said, “I apologize, but our shop primarily deals in silver coins. As for banknotes, one guan note is only equivalent to half tael of silver.”
“Why is that?” Zhu Geng stood up after hearing this, his face displeased. He spoke in a stern tone, “According to the court regulations, one guan note is equivalent to one tael of silver. How can you give more weight to silver coins and undermine the court’s regulations?”
The owner immediately knelt down, their face filled with sorrow, and said, “Esteemed gentlemen, it’s not just our shop that acts this way. All the merchants and traders do the same.”
Zhu Zhi waved his hand, stopping Zhu Geng who was about to speak out. He said, “If that’s the case, then let these three hundred guan notes be equivalent to one hundred and fifty taels. Once the goods are delivered to the Xi’an Gate, someone will pay you with silver coins. How about that?”
The owner expressed his gratitude repeatedly.
After Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng left Qingyan Tower, Zhu Geng said gloomily, “Fifteenth brother, why did you stop me?”
Zhu Zhi chuckled and said to Zhu Geng, “During the time you’ve been indulging in pleasure, haven’t you noticed that even those red-sleeved maidens no longer appreciate banknotes?”
Zhu Geng furrowed his brow. When one is in the embrace of beauty, who would pay attention to such details? Shouldn’t one focus their attention where it matters?
“Let’s go. It’s time for us to enter the palace. We still need to report this matter to the Emperor,” Zhu Zhi sighed.

Chapter 52: Depreciation of the Ming Dynasty’s Banknotes
During the Ming Dynasty, there were two departments in the palace: the Palace Condiments Service and the Imperial Winery.
The Palace Condiment Service was responsible for managing the supply of wine, vinegar, soybean paste, and other food items for the palace, including the consumption of wine by the palaces. The Imperial Winery, on the other hand, produced liquor specifically for the emperor and his family. The focus was on nourishing and health-preserving drinks such as Bamboo Leaf Green, Five-Flavor Soup, Pearl Red, Changchun Liquor, and Man Dian Xiang.
Zhu Yunwen had plans to produce alcohol, but he couldn’t use the health-preserving liquor for distillation. There had to be a limit to wastage. He couldn’t bear to use the limited supply of wine from the Palace Condiment Service, so he entrusted Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng to purchase wine from outside the palace.
Since it was still a period of rest, Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng went directly to the inner palace to pay respects to Empress Dowager before proceeding to the Kunning Palace to report to Zhu Yunwen about the Autumn Dew White wine. They brought a small jar of the wine for Zhu Yunwen to taste.
Zhu Yunwen took a sip and estimated that the alcohol content should be around 25 degrees. Autumn Dew White was already close to Chinese white liquor, although the “white” here only referred to its transparent appearance with a slight yellowish tint.
In ancient times, people often didn’t say drink wine, they say eat wine.
Prior to the Tang and Song dynasties, most alcoholic beverages were simple fermented wines or wine lees, with low alcohol content, insufficient refinement, and often containing sediments that needed to be consumed along with the drink.
Hence, the term “eating” wine.
The poet Lu You’s line, “Don’t laugh at the muddy farmhouse liquor, during the good harvest, guests are satisfied with chicken and pork,” indicated that guests should not mock the turbidity of the liquor but focus on the abundance of food accompanying it.
During the Song and Yuan dynasties, alcohol mainly consisted of low-alcohol rice wine.
In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, distillation and the production of distilled liquor gradually developed. By the Ming Dynasty, the production of distilled liquor had become more established, and the alcohol content had increased to some extent. However, during the reign of Emperor Jianwen, the alcohol content of distilled liquor was still relatively low.
To obtain alcohol with a 70-degree proof from a beverage with an alcohol content of just over 20 degrees required some effort.
Zhu Yunwen valued the Autumn Dew White wine. Since it was available outside the palace at an acceptable cost, he approved of it.
With the task completed, Zhu Zhi relaxed and reported, “Your Majesty, there is another matter that I’m not sure if I should bring up or not.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “Uncle, you and Uncle Geng have worked hard. Whatever matter it is, feel free to speak.”
Zhu Zhi took out two guan banknotes and one tael of silver, placing them together, and said, “Your Majesty, I have investigated and found that currently, merchants exchange two guan banknotes for one tael of silver, while some merchants only accept one guan banknote in exchange for three hundred wen. This matter should not be overlooked.”
Zhu Yunwen lowered his head and looked at the Ming Dynasty banknotes, his lips showing a hint of bitterness.
Paper currency was not an invention of Zhu Yuanzhang.
The earliest attempt at paper money can be traced back to the Western Han Dynasty with the issuance of White Deer Skin Currency.
In the late Tang Dynasty, there were flying money that functioned like bills of exchange.
However, true paper currency emerged during the Northern Song Dynasty with the introduction of “jiaozhi”, which later changed its name to “qianyin” and “xingzai huizi” during the Southern Song Dynasty.
In the first year of the Zhongtong era in the Yuan Dynasty, the Zhongtong Yuanbao notes was issued. The government’s income and expenditures, as well as commercial transactions, were conducted using the Zhongtong notes as the standard. At this time, money was “based on silver” and functioned as a form of credit exchange.
Later on, the Yuan Dynasty implemented a pure paper currency circulation system, prohibiting the circulation of gold, silver, and copper coins. Credit currency became non-convertible paper money.
From the perspective of studying historical currency, the Yuan Dynasty is undoubtedly a dynasty worthy of high attention and was the earliest country in the world to fully use paper money.
In Marco Polo’s “The Travels of Marco Polo,” it is recorded: “Wherever the merchants go in the Great Khan’s country, they pay expenses, purchase goods, and obtain prices for their goods with this paper money. And indeed, this is as good as if it were pure gold.” To some extent, this provided support for the development of the Western capitalist market.
The paper currency policy of the Yuan Dynasty can be considered quite successful, but it couldn’t withstand the greed of the court. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, when the court saw that there was no money, they simply decided to print more.
They engaged in reckless issuance, which led to rapid devaluation of the paper currency. As the paper money became useless, people turned back to using gold, silver, and copper coins. However, the merchants who were accustomed to using paper money were not accustomed to using these stupid bulky copper coins. Coupled with the poor quality of copper coins produced at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, after a couple of bumps, ah, it broke…
In the end, the market regressed to the ancient practice of barter.
Zhu Yuanzhang expelled the Mongols to the north, he himself established the Coinage service in Nanjing, intending to mint coins. However, in the process, he discovered a shortage of copper. He had no choice but to confiscate household utensils from the people and melt them down to make money, which led to public resentment.
Old Zhu observed the situation and realized something was not right. After careful consideration, he realized that paper currency had worked well before the Yuan Dynasty. “Existence is reasonable,” it must be possible if he can use it for himself. Therefore, he decided to change the currency system from coinage to paper money. The Supervisorate of Paper Money was established, and thus the circulation of paper money was born in the Ming Dynasty.
The material used for the Ming Dynasty’s Banknotes was mulberry bark, which was easily preserved and resulted in a bluish-gray colored paper.
The paper money was “one foot tall and six inches wide.” If you’re unfamiliar with this measurement, you can take a look at an A4 paper. Yes, the Ming Dynasty’s banknotes were that size. If Zhu Yuanzhang were still around, he could have applied for the Guinness World Record for the largest banknote, and it would have undoubtedly been in first place.
The banknote features intricate patterns on its surface, with dragon motifs printed around the edges. At the top, it reads “Da Ming Tong Xing Bao Chao(大明通行宝钞)”, while in the center, the denomination “Yi Guan(壹贯)”(one guan) is written. Below that, there is an official declaration from the Ministry of Revenue, stating: “Those who counterfeit will be executed, and those who report and capture them will be rewarded with 250 taels of silver.”
It’s worth mentioning that the Ming Dynasty’s banknotes had only six denominations: 100 wen, 200 wen, 300 wen, 400 wen, 500 wen, and one guan. One guan was the highest denomination.
If anyone frequently presented banknotes of several thousand or tens of thousands of taels, they would be caught and handed over to the authorities, and the captor would receive the reward.
Throughout the Ming Dynasty, there were no banknotes exceeding one guan. The use of large denominations of banknotes only occurred during the later Qing Dynasty and would never have appeared in the Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yunwen understood the importance of currency and the irrationality old Zhu paper currency policy. At present, the value of one guan had depreciated by one-third to one-half. If no reforms were made, the value of one guan banknotes would continue to decline. Eventually, the original value of one guan, equivalent to one thousand wen, would only be worth one wen or even one-tenth of a wen!
“The issue of banknotes will be set aside for now. To address this problem, we need a substantial amount of funds as support. Your current task is to study the knowledge of business. Merchants pursue profit, but they should not act rashly. Take today’s matter, for example. The shopkeepers have already given you two maces per jar. Why would you add it to three maces yourselves?”
“Do you know that because of your vanity, for ten thousand jars of wine, it would require an additional one thousand taels of silver? And for one hundred thousand jars, it would be ten thousand taels of silver. Moreover, this silver is not only have your share in it but also the empress’s share. Even if you are wealthy, you should not harm the empress’s interests.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng with a frustrated expression.
Zhu Zhi opened his mouth but didn’t know how to explain. He nudged Zhu Geng with his elbow, and Zhu Geng, with a pained expression, said something that made Zhu Zhi furious, “Then let’s make up for the ten thousand taels ourselves…”
Zhu Zhi really wanted to beat Zhu Geng. How could you be so clueless? In business, there is no concept of bearing the cost yourself.
Moreover, it was ten thousand taels!
Even the salary of a prince was only ten thousand stone, and at the highest conversion, it was still ten thousand taels. If we calculate it conservatively, it would be only five to six thousand taels. If you give away so much at once, my whole family will be left with nothing!
Zhu Yunwen laughed and said, “Let’s consider the first batch of ten thousand jars as three maces per jar. But for the subsequent batches, you need to renegotiate with the merchants. Additionally, inform the merchants that half of the wine jars will be returned, which can be offset against part of the money. Then, discuss a new price and sign a contract. Remember, you must not use your advantage to deceive others. Conduct business according to the principles of commerce.”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng were somewhat embarrassed. After leaving the palace, they were still uncertain about what to do. If they were to negotiate the price with the merchants, wouldn’t it be embarrassing?
“Smack!”
“What are you doing?”
“Fifteenth brother, my face hurts…”
Zhu Geng felt like crying without tears. Doing business was not an easy task.

Chapter 53: Success of Medical Gauze, Luo Yan’er Becomes a Noble Lady
Are all merchants shameless? Zhu Yunwen is not sure, but he knows that if Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng cannot change, they cannot be of use to him. The overall situation of imperial commercial affairs can only be entrusted to others.
Opportunities often come only once. If missed, it becomes a lifelong regret.
Although Ma Enhui feels regret for spending more money, she still hopes that Zhu Yunwen can be more tolerant towards Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng. She advises, “Your Majesty, the transformation from feudal lords to merchants takes time. They have already made good progress.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “They have done well in setting aside their noble status and engaging in lowly pursuits. However, commerce involves many considerations. It would be strange not to encounter difficulties and setbacks. If they brought experienced managers instead of servants, believe it or not, they could negotiate a deal for not just two maces, but even one and half maces.”
Ma Enhui furrowed her brows and skeptically said, “How is that possible? Businesses also have costs. Isn’t one and half maces too low?”
Zhu Yunwen stood up, picked up a jar of Autumn Dew White wine, poured a cup, and said, “Empress, this Autumn Dew White wine is primarily made from sorghum. One stone of sorghum, approximately 140 catties, is worth no more than five maces. Ten catties of sorghum can produce six catties of Autumn Dew White wine. One stone can yield 84 catties. Calculating the cost per catty of Autumn Dew White wine, it is only six wen.”
“This jar of wine weighs only three catties, so it amounts to twenty wen. Taking into account various labor, transportation, and other expenses, the total cost of one jar of wine is still one mace. Anything above that is profit. If they sell it for three mace, one jar of wine can yield a profit of two maces. Moreover, they usually sell it for five maces, earning a profit of four maces.”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen in astonishment and asked, “Such a significant profit? How did you calculate it so precisely?”
Zhu Yunwen laughed and said, “Empress, everything can be measured.”
Before Ma Enhui could ask further questions, there was a commotion outside the door.
Consort Ning and Consort Xian hurriedly entered the Kunning Palace. After exchanging greetings, they excitedly presented a piece of fabric.
Ma Enhui stood up in delight, quickly received it, examined it carefully, and then handed it to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen touched the soft gauze, exerted a slight force, but it didn’t tear. There was no lint falling, and it was loose and breathable, almost indistinguishable from the medical gauze of future.
“We did it!” Zhu Yunwen exclaimed in excitement.
“We did it!” Ma Enhui held the hands of Consort Ning and Consort Xian, looking at their somewhat gaunt faces, and emotionally said, “You’ve worked hard.”
Tears welled up in the eyes of Consort Ning and Consort Xian.
Since National Day, the Chengqian Palace has been working day and night, and finally made a breakthrough, weaving this medical gauze!
Zhu Yunwen tightly held the gauze and looked up, asking, “How was it resolved?”
Consort Ning quickly said, “Your Majesty, it was Murong Jing’er from the Arts Troupe and Luo Yan’er from the Palace Laundry service. They twisted two strands of cotton yarn together to obtain coarse cotton yarn as the warp, and used single cotton yarn as the weft to weave in plain weave, thus solving the problem.”
“Murong Jing’er, Luo Yan’er?”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curved into a smile.
He was familiar with Murong Jing’er, the pitiful girl from the Music office. But Luo Yan’er, he had never heard of before.
“Let’s go, we’ll go to the Chengqian Palace.”
Zhu Yunwen said with a smile.
In the Chengqian Palace, after everyone paid their respects, Zhu Yunwen saw Murong Jing’er again.
Murong Jing’er had a radiant smile and pulled Luo Yan’er from the side, saying to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, it was her idea. Jing’er was only responsible for weaving.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Yunwen looked closely at Luo Yan’er.
Her clear and unadorned face was devoid of makeup, with shiny black hair partially tied behind her neck, secured by a cheap wooden hairpin. In her soft autumn-like eyes, there was a trace of unyielding strength, refusing to accept her fate.
It was her hands that caught his attention—rough and weathered like aged tree bark, with two deep cracks revealing the crimson flesh beneath.
The toil of the Palace Laundry Service was not something an ordinary person could endure, especially in the cold winter days when clothes still needed washing. The freezing water combined with the harsh weather made it a painful experience.
“How did you come up with this method?” Zhu Yunwen softened his tone and asked.
Luo Yan’er dared not look at Zhu Yuncheng and whispered, “When mending clothes at the Palace Laundry service, we often use single strands or multiple strands. I have tried many times, but using only single strands doesn’t guarantee the necessary strength while relying solely on multiple strands results in inadequate density. That’s why I proposed to use both.”
Zhu Yuncheng nodded slightly and said to Ma Enhui, “This woman possesses great talent and has endured some hardships at the Laundry Bureau.”
Ma Enhui smiled and stepped forward, looking at Luo Yan’er’s hands that didn’t resemble those of a woman, and sighed, “These hands have done a great service for the country. Your Majesty, I suggest promoting Luo Yan’er to the rank of a cairen [1]Tl’s note: Cairen is an official title for a female official during ming dynasty but can also mean ‘ladies-in-waiting’ and bringing her into the Chengqian Palace to assist Consort Ning and Consort Xian in managing the palace. What do you think?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Luo Yan’er and said, “That’s a good idea.”
Luo Yan’er expressed her gratitude and politely declined, saying, “I would like to stay at the Palace Laundry service.”
“Sister!”
Qiao Hui rushed out anxiously from behind and quickly knelt down, saying, “Your Majesty, what older sister Luo just said is nonsense. She’s too sentimental. Older sister, please speak up!”
How could they miss such a rare opportunity?
They couldn’t tire themselves out at that wretched place, just for the sake of sisterly affection!
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, and Zhu Yunwen walked towards the spinning machine, saying, “Come to the Chengqian Palace and choose ten palace maids to accompany you. Since this method has proven to be effective, you need to promote it and teach everyone. If this succeeds, you will be in charge of the Chengqian Palace.”
Qiao Hui looked at Zhu Yunwen in astonishment. This meant that Luo Yan’er’s future could reach the status of a consort. She eagerly pulled Luo Yan’er, who knelt down to express her gratitude.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Murong Jing’er and said, “You have also contributed. What reward would you like?”
Murong Jing’er pondered for a moment and approached Zhu Yuncheng, saying naturally, “If we talk about rewards, I hope Your Majesty can provide more opportunities for the Arts Troupe. The current troupe has a large number of personnel but has achieved little. If this continues, it won’t last long.”
Zhu Yuncheng flicked the cotton string and listened to the buzzing sound, agreeing, “I have been considering this matter. You can organize the Arts Troupe and arrange a program. The format is flexible, but it should be diverse and able to delight the people of the capital. The entire program should last for four hours.”
“Shuangxi! Post a proclamation: On the Lantern Festival, the Imperial Arts Troupe will perform songs and dances at Mo Chou Lake at dusk. The Emperor and Empress will personally attend and celebrate the Lantern Festival with the people.”
Murong Jing’er was overjoyed and quickly expressed her gratitude, saying, “The Arts Troupe will live up to the mission! I will take my leave now and entrust these matters to the talented lady Luo. It will surely succeed.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, and Murong Jing’er bowed and left.
Looking at the palace maids, Zhu Yunwen’s eyes were filled with gratitude. It was their silent dedication that led to the final breakthrough. He surveyed the group and solemnly said, “You have all made great sacrifices for this medical gauze. On behalf of the people and the Ming Dynasty, I thank you. Each of you will receive triple the monthly stipend. Today, the Imperial Kitchen will prepare some food and drinks. I want to host a banquet for all of you.”
The Emperor hosting a banquet for palace maids?
There had never been such a precedent in the history of all kingdoms.
But Ma Enhui had no objections, and Consort Ning and Consort Xian also had no objections.
Some people choked up and tears flowed uncontrollably.
Compared to money, they were more moved by this respect, this care.
The Emperor was a good person.

Chapter 54: The Capitalist Seedling in the Harem…
The successful production of medical gauze did not mean it could be used directly.
Producing it was only the first step.
Zhu Yunwen was unable to produce pressure cookers, so high-pressure and high-temperature sterilization was not possible. Instead, they had to resort to boiling and high-temperature steaming for disinfection. Afterwards, the gauze was soaked in a jar containing vaseline emulsion to ensure thorough and even distribution. Then it was dried, cut, folded, sealed, and packaged, completing all the processes for medical gauze production.
Among these procedures, the most challenging one was the preparation of vaseline emulsion.
Vaseline can be divided into two types: natural and artificial, both of which are closely related to petroleum.
Natural vaseline is derived from the concentrated residue of petroleum, such as heavy oil of aliphatic hydrocarbons.
Artificial vaseline is made from pure ozokerite, paraffin wax, and mineral wax obtained through petroleum distillation.
There are many records of petroleum in ancient China, such as in the Book of Changes, where it states “Like the sun, there is fire in the marsh.” The “Geography” section of the Book of Han also mentions “Gaonu has ignitable water.” The “Brush Talk from Dream Book” describes it as “burning like hemp, but with dense smoke… because there is a lot of petroleum.”
During the Northern Song Dynasty, the Zhuotong well, known as the “Father of World Oil Drilling,” emerged. Initially, this type of well was used for salt extraction. However, after being introduced to the West, it became the foundation for petroleum drilling technology.
The term “petroleum” was coined by Shen Kuo during the Song Dynasty. In that era, the percussive drilling technique for wells was also developed.
In external warfare, especially during sieges, petroleum was a valuable weapon.
During the Northern Song Dynasty, Shen Gongliang listed petroleum as an essential military supply in his book “Complete Essentials for the Military Classics.”
During Wang Anshi’s reforms saw the establishment of specialized workshops for producing petroleum weapons, such as the “Menghuo Oil Cabinet.” This oil cabinet played a “decisive” role in the wars between the Song Dynasty and the Western Xia.
In the Yuan Dynasty, breakthroughs were made in petroleum extraction technology.
According to the records in the “Annals of the Yuan Dynasty” it is recorded that in Yan Gong County, there was a drilled oil well near the Nanying River. The oil from this well was used for lighting purposes and also as a treatment for skin diseases in livestock. It yielded an annual production of 110 catties. Furthermore, 80 miles to the northwest of Yan Chuan County, there was a well in Yongping Village. It produced 400 catties annually, which were stored in the Yanfeng Warehouse along the transportation route.
Although more than 500 catties a year may seem small, it was considered terrifying given the technology of the time.
The uses of petroleum in ancient times were mainly for lighting, lubrication, medicine, military supplies, and ink production.
Perhaps some people may find it strange, petroleum used for military purposes and ink production is understandable, but what about medicine?
But it is documented in Li Shizhen’s “Compendium of Materia Medica”. It states, “Petroleum has a similar odor to sulfur and is used to treat wounds. It is penetrating in nature, permeating through all the meridians and organs. It can treat convulsions, chest congestion, vomiting, and phlegm… It is used to resolve phlegm and can penetrate and open up the meridians and body cavities.”
Even before Li Shizhen, there were already mentions of the medicinal use of petroleum.
The conversation at that time might have been like this:
“This brother, your son has a fever. Don’t worry, let me get some petroleum from the pharmacy…”
The question is, did Zhu Yunwen in Nanjing have petroleum?
Surprisingly, he did!
According to the Ming Dynasty’s “Records of the Eastern Dynasty”, during the siege of Nanjing when Zhu Di broke into the city, Emperor Jianwen had gathered pearl garments, precious tents, treasury items, and various rare objects in the Lanxiang Hall of the Imperial Palace. They were soaked in highly flammable oil and mixed with asphalt.
Although the authenticity of the “Record of Eastern Dynasty” is subject to further investigation, there was indeed petroleum in the imperial palace in the capital at that time.
Zhu Yunwen personally checked and found that the quantity was not large, less than 600 catties, sealed in a pile of iron cans and stored in a separate warehouse.
By fractionating petroleum, they obtained paraffin, which eventually became vaseline emulsion.
This technology existed during the Song Dynasty, so there was no reason why it couldn’t be reproduced in the Ming Dynasty.
Combining medical gauze with vaseline allows the gauze to maintain a certain level of moisture when covering wounds, preventing the gauze from sticking to the wound’s blood or pus and aiding in wound healing.
Before the Lantern Festival, the first batch of gauze was successfully completed and packaged in wooden boxes that had been disinfected with alcohol. Each wooden box contained fifty small packs of medical gauze, a pair of small scissors, and a small glass bottle of alcohol.
Zhu Yunwen summoned Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng into the palace, tapped on the wooden boxes, and smiled, saying, “There’s no problem with the medical gauze. The current issue is how you will sell it to the Ministry of War.”
Zhu Zhi assuredly replied, patting his chest, “Your Majesty, this matter is easy. Leave it to us. However, when the Ministry of War makes the purchase, how should we set the price?”
Ma Enhui also approached, her eyes shining with anticipation.
This was a matter concerning the treasury of the harem, and as the head of the harem, how could Ma Enhui not be concerned?
Zhu Yunwen took out an account book and handed it to Zhu Zhi, saying, “Cotton and alcohol are the largest costs. Currently, the cost of one box is forty wen. However, considering the need for external procurement of petroleum in the future, as well as the investment of manpower in the harem and monthly expenses, the cost of one box should be at least one hundred wen, equivalent to one mace. Besides covering these expenses, we also need to make a profit. The minimum price should be three maces.”
“Of course, three maces is the bottom line. I suggest a price of five maces per box. If you can sell it for six maces, or even eight maces, that would be your ability, and you can have a larger share of the profit. But remember, business is a long-term endeavor, and mutual benefit is necessary for long-term success. If the Ministry of War makes a large purchase, you can give them a discount.”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng were overjoyed and had thirty wooden boxes moved away, preparing to embark on their sales venture.
Ma Enhui held the abacus in her hand, made some calculations, and looked at Zhu Yunwen, saying, “The monthly expenses in the palace are usually taken from the internal treasury, right? Why are they also included in the cost of one box? Besides, Your Majesty only mentioned the current costs but didn’t consider how many boxes can be produced daily.”
“At present, we only have twelve sets of weaving machines and a limited number of workers, but we can produce twenty boxes per day. Given time, we can expand the scale and produce a hundred boxes per day without any problem. If one box is sold for five maces and we produce a hundred boxes per day, that would be fifty taels of silver, resulting in a monthly income of one thousand five hundred taels! And in a year, it would be eighteen thousand taels… My goodness, Your Majesty, I feel a bit dizzy.”
Zhu Yunwen supported Ma Enhui and smiled, saying, “Empress, that’s not how the accounts work. Besides the costs, we also need to allocate a portion to Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng…”
“Why not hand over this excellent opportunity entirely to the harem?! The two kings are benefiting for nothing!” Ma Enhui petulantly remarked, snorted, and then said, “Since there’s a profit to be made, I hereby command Luo Yan’er to prepare for expanding production.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the money-oriented Ma Enhui and reminded her, “Empress, there aren’t many weaving machines in the palace that can be spared for Chengqian Palace…”
Ma Enhui widened her eyes and asked Zhu Yunwen, “Are you suggesting that I haven’t received a single coin yet and still need to buy weaving machines?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “We agreed not to request it in the name of the harem, heh heh. If the Empress wants to expand the scale, she will have to invest some money.”
Ma Enhui’s eyes flickered, and she smiled, saying, “I have a solution.”
The Empress wanted to personally spin cotton as an example for the people, urging officials and scholars throughout the country not to forget the hardships of agriculture and to cherish the labor of the people. However, she lamented day and night over the old and insufficient number of weaving machines in the palace.
Upon hearing this, Zheng Ci, the Minister of Works, made a decisive move and directly allocated twenty weaving machines to the palace.
The Empress praised the Ministry of Works but expressed her desire to start from the de-seeding process, stating that it is essential to “experience the entire process and understand the hardships faced by the people.”
Touched by the Empress’s determination, the officials and workers of the Ministry of Works were moved to tears. They not only provided the necessary equipment such as cotton gins, spinning wheels, and weaving looms for the processes of de-seeding, carding, spinning, and weaving in the imperial palace but also kindly offered to provide technical training if needed.
The request was mercilessly rejected by the empress…

Chapter 55: Declaration of a Properous Era
The ones sent by the Ministry of Work cannot be considered as solicitation,
Ma Enhui proudly looked at Zhu Yunwen. Without spending a penny, they had resolved the initial production setup and expanded the production scale…
However, this blatant act of “bribery and corruption” left Zhu Yunwen dumbfounded. The officials from the Ministry of Works were too skilled at what they did, catering to their preferences without leaving any room for refusal. Shouldn’t they be sent for reform through labor?
However, the bribe taker was his own wife. If he angered the ringleader, he would probably have nowhere to sleep. After some thought, he decided to turn a blind eye and pretend as if nothing had happened.
On the morning of the Lantern Festival, Mo Chou Lake was already bustling with people, crowded from all sides.
The Emperor and Empress were going to celebrate the Lantern Festival here with the people. In such a flourishing era, it naturally attracted countless scholars, merchants, and even some officials who didn’t want to miss out. They had arrived early at Mo Chou Lake.
A high platform was set up by the lake, surrounded by translucent curtains. Figures moved about inside, occasionally accompanied by the sound of bamboo instruments.
Underneath the platform, soldiers were arranging tables and chairs.
The Emperor and Empress were coming. They couldn’t possibly sit on cold stools. A small stove was placed nearby for warmth at least.
What? The Grand Secretaries were also coming?
Then they should be seated in the front row.
The Five Army Commandery wanted in the front row?
On what grounds? A group of rough men, except for Xu Huizu, all of them sit in the second row.
The Minister of Rites, Chen Di, who was in charge of seating arrangements, was not afraid of offending people. He decisively made the decisions.
In addition to the Jinwu Guard, the Great Ming Security Bureau was also responsible for maintaining order.
Liu Changge stood beside Chen Di, his sharp gaze scanning the crowd. He said with some difficulty, “Official Chen, why did the Emperor make such a grand gesture? What if something unexpected happens?”
Chen Di wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at the enthusiastic crowd. He smiled and said, “Commander Liu, this is beneficial for the people’s hearts. In past dynasties, the Emperor always sat high within the court, and the common people, although aware of the Emperor’s existence, only had a superficial understanding. The Emperor celebrates National Day and Lantern Festival with the people, so not only do the people know about the Emperor exist, they also know that the Emperor is here.”
Liu Changge pointed to his heart, understanding the meaning behind Chen Di’s words. He nodded slightly and said, “It seems that I, understand the Emperor less than Official Chen does.”
Chen Di straightened an untidy chair and said to Liu Changge, “Commander Liu also has merits, and the court historians will not forget you.”
Chen Di admired Liu Changge, the commander of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
The present Great Ming Security Bureau did not follow the path of the Jinyiwei. After operating for nearly half a year, they hadn’t wrongfully arrested anyone or fabricated any cases, completely dispelling the court officials’ concerns about the Security Bureau.
Liu Changge stood tall, a faint smile of indifference appearing on his sharp face.
Leaving a mark in the annals of history, living up to a lifetime!
Chen Di approached closer and asked in a low voice, “Commander Liu, is there any news from Beiping?”
Liu Changge glanced at Chen Di and said cautiously, “If Official Chen wants to know the news, you can check the confidential documents in the Grand Secretariat regarding Beiping. Asking me, you might be asking the wrong person.”
Chen Di burst into laughter and bowed, saying, “Yes, I shouldn’t have asked you. Ah, I have also seen the confidential documents in the Grand Secretariat. King of Yan is not feeling well, and the command of the Three Guards has been transferred to Zhu Gaochi. However, Zhu Gaochi handed over the seal and other items of the Three Guards to Commander Ping’an.”
“With this, the worries in Beiping are finally resolved. However, this document is from the third day of the first lunar month, and it has been more than ten days since then. I wonder when the new reports will arrive,” Chen Di remarked.
Liu Changge smiled at the corner of his mouth and said to Chen Di, “It’s coming soon. Please wait a little longer.”
Seeing the relaxed and contented expression on Liu Changge’s face, Chen Di felt extremely relieved. Needless to say, there must be positive progress in Beiping’s affairs.
If King of Yan genuinely pledges allegiance, the Great Ming will be as stable as Mount Tai.
A few months ago, Chen Di opposed the proposals of Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng to reduce the powers of the vassal kings. Now, the Emperor had acted calmly without making any noise, resolving the crisis from thousands of miles away. This deeply impressed Chen Di.
Inside the high platform, Murong Jing’er was rehearsing the performances. This was the first performance of the Cultural Troupe in the capital. Murong Jing’er did not allow any mistakes. The performances were all individual talents, and she had made some adjustments based on Zhu Yunwen’s suggestions.
As dusk approached, Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui rode in a dragon boat along the Qinhuai River to Sanshan Bridge, entering the main street outside Sanshan Gate and heading to the West Garden of Mo Chou Lake.
Along the way, the people cheered and shouted with joy.
Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui, riding together in the imperial carriage, waved their hands frequently, signaling to the people and showing their goodwill.
“Long live the Emperor, long live the Empress!”
Someone shouted, and the whole street echoed with thunderous voices, one after another, until Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui, along with their entourage, entered the inner area of the West Garden performance stage. The cheering and excitement continued without ceasing.
Consort Ning, Consort Xian, and the cairen Luo Yan’er also accompanied them out of the palace. As they witnessed the scene of the people’s adoration and the reverence of the masses, they couldn’t help but be deeply moved and astonished.
“We pay our respects to the Emperor and Empress!”
Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, Chen Di, and other officials bowed and saluted. Zhu Yunwen raised his right hand and said, “Rise, everyone. Today is the Lantern Festival, a time for family reunions. Let us enjoy the festivities with the people.”
Zhu Yunwen looked back and saw a three-zhang gap between the inner and outer areas. Standing in those positions were hundreds of soldiers, all holding shields and wearing long swords, on high alert. He furrowed his brow and looked at Liu Changge, asking, “Didn’t I say not to obstruct the people? Why is it like this?”
Liu Changge hurriedly bowed and said, “Your Majesty, it is for safety. We can only proceed in this manner!”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said sternly, “These are my subjects. Will the people of the Great Ming harm me? If that’s the case, I might as well stay in the palace. Remove all the guards. I want to see who dares to harm me in front of the people of the world!”
Liu Changge was in a dilemma. If the crowd got too close without a buffer zone, and someone made a rush, it would be an offense to the imperial dignity. He looked at Xu Huizu and Xie Jin, gesturing for them to say something.
Xie Jin stepped forward and said, “Your Majesty, please don’t be angry. Commander Liu is only considering the safety of Your Majesty and the Empress. How about this? Let the guards remain in the inner area, and we can remove them from the outer area.”
Zhu Yunwen didn’t say anything. Seeing that he had tacitly agreed, Xie Jin signaled Liu Changge to make the arrangements.
As night fell, a bright moon rose in the east, casting its light into countless households.
Countless people looked at the full moon behind the high platform. At this moment, the moon appeared exceptionally round and complete.
The sound of bronze gongs rang out, and the bustling atmosphere at the shores of Mo Chou Lake suddenly subsided.
A strong man stepped onto the stage, gathered his breath, and he shouted loudly, “On this Lantern Festival, with the presence of the Emperor and Empress, it is truly a grand occasion. Now, I invite the Emperor and Empress of the Great Ming to ascend the stage and deliver a speech.”
As Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui climbed onto the stage, the lights on the stage became even brighter. Before they could speak, the crowd below erupted:
“Long live the Emperor, long live the Empress!”
The sound surged like a tide, echoing in the distance.
The sound of the bronze gongs subsided, and the people gradually quieted down.
Zhu Yunwen signaled for Ma Enhui to speak first. Ma Enhui, who was in charge of managing the imperial harem on a daily basis, had witnessed many grand occasions. However, compared to the scene today, it was like a small fish in a big pond.
“On this Lantern Festival, I would like to express my wishes. I hope that in the Great Ming, scholars can realize their ambitions, the people will no longer suffer from hunger and cold, craftsmen will excel in their work, merchants will contribute to their families and the country, and there will be numerous acts of righteousness. Let us wish for eternal prosperity for the Great Ming!”
Ma Enhui shouted loudly.
The people erupted in excitement, their voices chanting “May the Great Ming prosper” reaching the heavens.
After three waves of cheers, Zhu Yunwen raised his hand to silence the crowd. In the moment of silence, he shouted, “You are the subjects of the Great Ming, you are my subjects. Let us work together in unity, overcome obstacles, and build a glorious era for the Great Ming!”
His voice reverberated and struck the surface of Mo Chou Lake, spreading even farther along the water. The sound reached into the distance.
A prosperous era!
This was the declaration of a prosperous era!
The people in the capital heard the voice of a prosperous era for the first time!
The people cheered wildly!
In an instant, numerous fireworks soared into the sky, bursting into colorful displays.
At this moment, the bright moon was merely a backdrop.
The Emperor and Empress of the Great Ming were the real stars of the show!

Chapter 56: The Single Whip Method, the Final Glory of Grain Administrator
The first performance of the Art Troupe was deemed perfect.
Especially the grand chorus of one hundred singers and dancers under the moonlight, spreading the prayer of “May we all live long and share the beauty of the moonlight” among the people.
The emergence of the grand chorus art form astonished everyone in the capital. This refreshing style deeply impressed everyone, even including Ma Enhui who couldn’t help but praise it.
Since the Lantern Festival, the Art Troupe became renowned in the capital.
Not satisfied yet, Xie Jin, in front of the emperor, requested the Art Troupe to perform at his home to entertain his elderly father.
Emperor Zhu Yunxuan looked at Murong Jing’er, then said to Jie Jin, “Performing is not a problem, but the members of the Art Troupe need to eat…”
Xie Jin was a little puzzled. Did he have to provide wages to the palace’s Art Troupe?
Before Xie Jin could comprehend, Xu Huizu was already discussing the performance price with Murong Jing’er.
“One hundred taels of silver!” Xu Huizu straightforwardly made an offer.
Murong Jing’er was stunned. Could she earn one hundred taels of silver just by performing at the Xu family’s place? Wasn’t the money coming too easily?
Seeing that Murong Jing’er didn’t agree, Xu Huizu increased the offer, “Miss Jing’er, how about two hundred taels?”
Liu Changge leaned in, his face cold, and said, “Five hundred taels.”
Xu Huizu gritted his teeth and questioned Liu Changge, “Your parents are no longer here. Why do you need five hundred taels to go back? Go cool off somewhere else!”
Liu Changge felt frustrated. It was as if Xu Huizu’s parents were still alive. But he didn’t dare to say it out loud. After all, Xu Huizu was a duke, and he couldn’t afford to offend him. But he had to fulfill the task assigned by the emperor.
“Five hundred taels,” Liu Changge said with a stern face.
Xu Huizu, realizing the awkwardness on Liu Changge’s face, quickly understood the reason behind it.
Needless to say, this Liu Changge was raising the price as a “middleman.”
Normally, Xu Huizu would kick out such a middleman and solve all the problems. But this middleman was appointed by the emperor…
“Fine, five hundred taels!” Xu Huizu reluctantly exclaimed.
Murong Jing’er expressed her gratitude to Duke Wei on behalf of the Art Troupe.
When Xie Jin came over, it was already too late. Upon hearing the price of five hundred taels, he almost fainted. His annual salary was only five hundred taels…
Xie Jin gave up and decided not to spend this unjust money.
Zhu Yunwen approached and noticed that Xie Jin seemed eager to escape. He sighed and said, “Minister Xie, your father seems unhappy and troubled… As a Grand Secretariat of the current court, filial piety should be your priority, taking good care of your elderly parents…”
Xie Jin felt like crying, Your Majesty, is this how you conduct a robbery?
On the 16th day of the first month, during the morning court assembly
Zhu Yunwen officially issued a decree to proclaim to the world the implementation of the “Single Whip Method,” a taxation system for agriculture. It unified all land taxes, labor services, and various miscellaneous taxes and levies into one, collecting silver based on acreage or grain.
The Grain Administration system was abolished, and official collections were handled by officials.
Taking into consideration the varying fertility of the land and grain production, Zhu Yunwen adopted the recommendation of the Grand Secretariat and implemented a policy of collecting silver based on acreage or grain.
If the local land was fertile, silver would be collected based on acreage, while if the land was infertile, silver would be collected based on grain.
Under the Ministry of Revenue, two departments were established: the Agriculture Tax Department, responsible to the Ministry of Revenue, and the Inspection and Supervision Department, accountable to the emperor and the Grand Secretariat.
The Agriculture Tax Department would oversee national agricultural tax affairs, replacing the Commercial Tax offices, with the Provincial Agricultural tax department, Prefectural Agricultural Tax department, and County Agricultural Tax department.
Thirteen Provincial Administration Commissioner work together with the Provincial Agricultural Tax department to complete agricultural tax work within the province. The role of the Provincial Administration Commissioner has changed from being primarily responsible for tax administration to one of coordination, supervision, and distribution.
Coordination involves providing assistance to various levels of agricultural tax departments in solving problems they encounter.
Supervision entails overseeing the implementation of a Single Whip method by various levels of agricultural tax departments.
Distribution refers to the Provincial Administration Commissioner’s authority to allocate tax revenues among the different levels of agricultural tax departments based on the standard set by the imperial court: Three parts for the local government and seven parts for the central government.
In his edict, Zhu Yunwen clearly stated that three parts of the tax revenues should be allocated to the local government after deducting the expenses of the provincial, prefectural, and county administrations. If there is any surplus, it should be distributed according to the officials’ rank, decreasing progressively to benefit officials in their daily lives.
At the same time, a new provision was added: if the annual surplus exceeds one million taels of silver, the officials would receive a negative evaluation.
Zhu Yunwen’s intentions were clear. The central government allowed the local government to take three parts of the tax revenues, which would serve as the operational funds for the local administration. If there is still a surplus, it should be shared among officials at various levels to improve their living standards.
However, the central government strictly prohibited local governments from accumulating an annual surplus exceeding one million taels of silver.
Otherwise, during the evaluation by the Ministry of Personnel, they would receive a negative assessment.
This limitation imposed by Zhu Yunwen considered three points:
First, local governments could reserve a portion of their finances but should avoid amassing excessive financial power that could threaten the central government.
Second, if there is a surplus in the local finances, it can be shared among officials. When officials have money, they would not hoard it but spend it, which would contribute to promoting trade and laying the foundation for future commercial development.
If officials have no money and lack basic purchasing power, how can commerce thrive?
Third, it aims to motivate local governments at all levels.
The larger the financial resources available to local governments, the more income they receive. Directly linking the finances with the living standards of officials helps drive local agricultural and rural development.
To address issues such as duplicated taxation and fluctuating grain and silver prices, dedicated grain-silver exchange points were established by the agricultural tax departments, with personnel from the Agricultural Tax department, Inspection department, and Provincial Administration office jointly overseeing them.
The agricultural tax departments have the responsibility to explain and publicize to taxpayers that taxes are only collected twice a year and that there will be no duplicate taxation. If anyone forcibly demands additional taxes, taxpayers can seek help from any of the agricultural tax departments, inspection departments, or provincial administration office and someone will assist them.
The implementation of a Single Whip method protected the interests of middle and lower-class self-cultivating farmers but affected the interests of wealthy farmers and landlords. The middle and lower-class self-cultivating farmers only have a limited amount of land, usually just a few dozen mu (Chinese unit of area), and they cannot pay much in terms of land or grain for tax purposes.
However, for wealthy farmers and large landowners, they own a significant amount of land!
A few hundred mu can only be considered as wealthy farmers!
True landlords and wealthy gentry would have several thousand mu of land, and it would be embarrassing for them to admit to having anything less. Some large landowners might even possess tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of mu of land!
If taxes were assessed based on per mu or per unit of grain, the landlords would have to pay a much larger amount of tax.
In Changxing County, Huzhou Prefecture,
the Grain Administrator Zhou Bunong, accompanied by seven or eight attendants, arrogantly walked down the street, confiscating goods from the villagers’ stalls without hesitation, whether it was steamed buns or bamboo baskets. At the end, he would scold and curse, and the villagers dared not resist.
A familiar figure on the street caught Zhou Bunong’s attention, and he shouted, “Wang Erniu, stop!”
Upon hearing the voice, Wang Erniu turned around and immediately paled in fear. He started running away.
Zhou Bunong and his men chased after him until they reached Wang Erniu’s dilapidated courtyard. Wang Erniu rushed inside and barricaded himself behind the door, pleading, “Grain Administrator Zhou, please have mercy! I have already paid my autumn taxes. Why won’t you leave me alone?”
“Nonsense! You only paid five dou of brown rice. How is that enough? Do you think you can escape punishment by hiding? If you don’t pay in full today, I will confiscate your ten mu of land!” Zhou Bunong shouted loudly.
Wang Erniu stood by the window and cried out in pain, “I clearly paid three dan of brown rice!”
“There’s still a portion of that three dan that belongs to me! According to the imperial regulations, you are still short by two shi and five dou of autumn taxes. As a Grain Administrator, i bear the responsibility of collecting and transporting grain. If you don’t pay, I will go to Nanjing, meet the emperor, and make sure your entire family is killed!” Zhou Bunong threatened.
Wang Erniu had a mournful expression on his face. He opened the door and was met with a beating from Zhou Bunong’s attendants. Wang Erniu’s wife and children also ran over, but how could they withstand the blows from these thugs? Within moments, they fell to the ground, crying in pain.
“Search the place!”
Zhou Bunong commanded his subordinates, and they thoroughly searched the room, carrying out sacks of rice and rice jars.
“Lord Grain Administrator, there’s only about one dan three dou here, not enough!”
“Not enough? Heh, not enough, you say.”
Zhou Bunong leaned over, looking at the heavily injured Wang Erniu, and coldly said, “Either you’ll be executed by the court, or you sell me your ten mu of land for five dan of rice, or perhaps, heh, your daughter can be used to settle the debt.”
PS:
The data regarding the land owned by landlords in the text is not exaggerated.
During the mid-Ming Dynasty, some fields owned by kings encompassed millions of mu. However, it should be noted that the kings, as major landlords, were exempt from taxation.

Chapter 57: The Decline of the Grain Administrator System
A prosperous era, ants weep; a chaotic era, ants perish.
This is the tragedy of feudal dynasties and a true portrayal of the lower class for thousands of years.
When looking at any prosperous era in history, most of it is the portrayal of wealth and beauty through the eyes of scholars. It depicts the accumulation of wealth in one or several regions, often achieved through methods similar to the Yuan Dynasty’s “Extreme poverty in the south, extravagance in the north,” where they plundered the wealth of the entire country to showcase the prosperity of the era.
As for the lower class, whether it’s five people sharing one old pair of pants or an old ox tilling dozens of acres of land, it has nothing to do with others.
Officials enjoy fine wine with their eyes closed, businessmen pursue profits far away, and scholars ponder over what kind of poem to write for tomorrow’s spring outing, seeking applause from a packed audience.
It seems that everyone’s eyes are rolling back, looking upward but not downward.
This is an eye disease that needs to be treated.
What Zhu Yuanzhang pursued for the prosperous era was not the indulgence and revelry of a few landowners but the worry-free livelihood of the majority of the lower class!
Yes, just a worry-free livelihood!
As for the main contradiction between material and cultural conflicts in later generations, it has absolutely nothing to do with the current Ming Dynasty!
If they can’t have enough to eat and wear, why would you export culture?
The level of moderate prosperity is something Zhu Yuanzhang didn’t dare to hope for. It took 70 years for the People’s Republic of China, relying on large-scale industry, major policies, commerce, transportation, and poverty alleviation efforts, to basically achieve a moderately prosperous society.
The Ming Dynasty currently has nothing. What makes you think you can strive for moderate prosperity?
The only feasible approach is to first relieve the burden on the farmers and allow them to produce and retain some surplus.
Those in good situations can exchange surplus grain for money to improve their lives, while those in unfavorable situations won’t have to resort to begging for food during times of famine and can rely on government relief.
The implementation of the “Single Whip Method” is the most suitable means for the current Ming Dynasty.
The highest official of the Agricultural Tax department is the Left Vice Minister, held by Xia Yuanji, while the Right Vice Minister is held by Yan Qiliang. Xia Yuanji oversees the agricultural taxes nationwide and is responsible for addressing issues at all levels and in all regions. Yan Qiliang, on the other hand, travels outside the capital to implement the “Single Whip Method,” focusing mainly on the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas.
Upon arriving in Huzhou Prefecture, Yan Qiliang arranges for accompanying interns to be led by officials from the Provincial Administration office to various counties to implement the “Single Whip Method.” If they encounter any resistance, the officials from the Provincial Administration office must fully cooperate. If they encounter obstacles from local officials, the interns should report to the prefecture’s Agricultural Tax department, which will then contact the provincial administration office to replace the officials.
Hu Jun, a student of the Imperial Academy, galloped on his horse, leading twelve men into Changxing County. Before they reached the County Office, they heard cries of despair and misery, echoing through the air.
“Team leader, we should go to the County Office.” Yang Chengxuan, an official from the Administration office, frowned as Hu Jun came to a halt.
Hu Jun turned his horse around and said, “As a member of the investigation team, it is our duty to understand the grievances of the people. How can we turn a blind eye? Let’s go and take a look.”
It was a dilapidated alley, with some slightly better houses having low earthen walls as fences. Most of the houses were simple wooden structures. Walking down the alley, one could easily see what was inside the courtyards.
What saddened Hu Jun was that in all the courtyards, he did not see a single grain storage bin. Not even a single grain of food was visible outside. Looking at the rundown, low houses, it seemed unlikely that more than a few people could live there. Even if someone did live there, they wouldn’t be able to store more than a few dan of grain.
“Release my daughter, release my daughter!”
“Zhou bastard, I’ll fight you to the end!”
“I’m contributing grain for the Emperor. If you dare to resist, it’s tantamount to opposing the Emperor. Are you trying to rebel? Beat him, even if he’s beaten to death, it’s still relieving the court of its worries!”
Amidst the clamor, accompanied by the sound of heavy beatings and cries, Hu Jun’s heart was pierced with despair.
“Stop right there!”
Sitting on his horse, Hu Jun shouted loudly, waving his hand as the students and officials from the Administration office dismounted behind him.
Hu Jun got off his horse and grimaced in discomfort. Riding for a long time was truly a torture. Awkwardly stretching his legs, Hu Jun led the group into the courtyard.
Upon hearing the commotion, Zhou Bunong came out of his house and was taken aback by the large number of people. Upon closer inspection, he noticed that the leader was dressed as a student, which filled him with disdain. He shouted, “Just passing through? If you know what’s good for you, mind your own business and don’t disturb me!”
Fearlessly, Hu Jun walked towards Zhou Bunong and looked at the thugs blocking the entrance. He said in a deep voice, “Step aside!”
The thugs glanced at Zhou Bunong, who sneered and said, “This household is a rebel. If you’re smart, you should leave immediately and not jeopardize your own future.”
Hu Jun chuckled and turned to Zhou Bunong, coldly asking, “May I ask who you are?”
Zhou Bunong puffed out his chest and shouted, “I am Zhou Bunong, the grain administrator of Changxing. It is my duty to collect and transport taxes and grain. This household has failed to pay taxes and grain. As a grain administrator, I must act on behalf of the court, share the Emperor’s concerns, and ensure that not a single grain of grain is missing on its way to the capital!”
“Grain administrator?”
Hu Jun nodded slightly and clasped his hands together.
Zhou Bunong felt even more powerful.
Indeed, the grain administrator of this era had some authority.
Grain administrator were not officials, but they wielded power.
The grain administrator system was established by Zhu Yuanzhang to facilitate the collection of taxes and grain. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, most of the previous generations of landlords had died, and the new generation of landlords was not numerous enough. The land was still widely scattered, making it difficult for the government to collect grain.
Zhu Yuanzhang then had an idea, if there was no one in charge for it, he simply found people to take charge of it. It wasn’t difficult at all. He appointed several grain administrators to take charge and manage the affairs, isn’t it solved?
Grain administrators were responsible for a designated area, usually with a grain yield of ten thousand dan or a few thousand dan. One to four grain administrators were appointed in each area to oversee the collection, storage, and transportation of grain.
When the grain administrators arrived in the capital, old Zhu would host a banquet to meet everyone and have a drink. Old Zhu took a look, young man you look decent, had an acceptable physical condition, and lacked intelligence, could serve as an obedient official. With a decisive stroke of his brush, Don’t go back to being a grain administrators, stay here and serve as a secretary in the Ministry of Revenue.”
But how were the grain administrators selected?
Old Zhu’s criteria was simple: whoever contributed the most grain would become a grain administrator. The reason was straightforward, these people had made contributions to my old Zhu’s family.
Who contributed the most grain?
The landlords, of course.
A group of small and medium-sized landlords became the grassroots pillars of Zhu Yuanzhang, governing the lower class alongside village head and militia leader. Some influential grain administrators even had the power to hear lawsuits and administer justice. Even the county magistrate had to consider their opinions.
Watching Hu Jun turn and walk towards his horse, Zhou Bunong sneered and said, “Young man, take care of yourself.”
From the baggage on his horse, Hu Jun pulled out a document and turned to Zhou Bunong with a smile. “Grain Administrator Zhou, listen carefully. The court has abolished the position of grain administrator. There will be no more grain administrators in Great Ming!”
“What? That’s impossible!”
Zhou Bunong’s face filled with fear and panic.
“The court document is right here. How can it be impossible?”
Hu Jun threw down the document and looked at the group of thugs, shouting sternly, “I am Hu Jun, the team leader of the Department of Agricultural Tax Department of the Great Ming. Anyone who dares to obstruct my entry into the households will be punished for insubordination. Step aside now!”



---


Chapter 58: Poverty is Not a Prosperous Era, the Ambitious Hu Jun
The thugs immediately panicked and no longer dared to obstruct them.
Hu Jun entered the house and looked at the scattered brown rice on the ground, as well as the injured family. Even the young girl had a clear palm print on her face.
“Official, we pay taxes, we pay taxes. Even if we sell the ten mu of land, we will gather enough three dan of grain. Please, don’t take our Ying’er away. She’s only twelve years old!”
Wang Erniu crawled to Hu Jun’s front and kowtowed repeatedly.
Hu Jun was moved, looking at the family kneeling before him, pleading with tears in his eyes!
Land!
It was their means of survival, the foundation of their lives!
Once they sold their land, they would no longer be self-sufficient farmers but become tenants of the landlords. At that time, all the harvested grain would be taken by the landlords as they pleased. They would never be able to rise up in their lifetime!
Ten mu of land, three dan of grain?!
One mu of land for three dou of grain?!
Damn it!
Currently, the average yield per mu of ordinary land was only around one to two dan of wheat, and fertile land yielded around three dan.
In the case of Changxing, where they were, the paddy yield per mu was roughly between two to three dan.
Last year, Changxing experienced little rainfall and a poor harvest. It was heard that the yield per mu was only slightly over one dan.
Based on one dan being equal to ten dou, paying three dou of tax would be nearly three-quarters of the yield!
With such heavy taxes, it was the tax system from the time of Emperor Taizu, which had been abolished by Zhu Yunwen in the thirty-first year of Hongwu!
These despicable grain administrators dared to deceive the villagers, continuing to enforce heavy taxes while paying according to Zhu Yunwen’s new tax system to the court!
What went in and what came out all ended up in the pockets of these people!
In the astonished gazes of the Office manager Yang Chengxuan and others, Hu Jun knelt down, supported Wang Erniu with both hands, and shouted, “No need to sell the land, and no one will take your daughter! It’s the fault of the court, the court has let you down! I, Hu Jun, tell you here that from now on, no one will take your land, and you no longer need to pay heavy taxes!”
After Hu Jun finished speaking, he kneeled down.
Boom!
A muffled sound that touched the hearts of everyone present!
Wang Erniu looked at the official before him in astonishment. He actually knelt down to him this poor and ragged farmer?
What was going on?
It seemed like he was even shedding tears.
Hu Jun helped Wang Erniu up and pulled up the entire Wang family. He turned to the people outside and said, “Office manager, Zhou Bunong has violated the national law, arrogantly exploiting and abusing the villagers, forcing them to sell their land and seizing their daughters. Such wicked criminals, if you don’t take action, I will report to the court and inform the Emperor. This is the truth of our Great Ming! This is the prosperous era in the eyes of His Majesty!”
Yang Chengxuan gritted his teeth, waved his hand, and shouted, “Arrest Zhou Bunong and bring him to the county office of Changxing. Let the magistrate interrogate and convict him personally!”
“Heh, I don’t trust the magistrate of Changxing! Office manager, I suggest you go there in person!”
Hu Jun suppressed his anger and said.
Yang Chengxuan nodded slightly and said, “In that case, I will go there in person, and you should come early too! It seems that Changxing is about to face a storm.”
Hu Jun solemnly said, “I will petition the court and stay here. If things are not settled in the local area, I will not return to the Imperial Academy or the capital!”
“Brother Hu?!”
Yang Chengxuan looked at Hu Jun in shock.
Hu Jun was an outstanding student of the Imperial Academy, and he was even one of the main participants in the design of the three national symbols “national flag, national emblem, national anthem” at the Imperial Academy. If he abandoned the national symbols and actively participated in the law enforcement of Single whip method, it was enough to earn Yang Chengxuan’s admiration.
If he further gave up returning to the Imperial Academy and stayed in the local area, it would mean that it would be difficult for him to enter the Grand Secretariat! At most, he would spend decades enduring hardships and trials in the local area, and he might only become a magistrate!
This sacrifice was too great!
Hu Jun waved his hand and said to Yang Chengxuan, “The Emperor wants a prosperous era, right? But you should know that poverty is not a prosperous era! I, Hu Jun, will stay here and show the Emperor when the real prosperous era comes and the people can eat their fill. It won’t be too late to go back then!”
Yang Chengxuan solemnly respected Hu Jun, deeply bowed to him, and stood up, saying, “Since Brother Hu has such great ambition, then count me in!”
“Brother Yang!”
Hu Jun approached excitedly.
Yang Chengxuan laughed and said, “Only when external things are in order can knowledge be attained.
Only when knowledge is attained can intentions be sincere.
Only when intentions are sincere can the mind be righteous.
Only when the mind is righteous can the self be cultivated.
Only when the self is cultivated can the family be harmonious.
Only when the family is harmonious can the country be well governed.
Only when the country is well governed can there be peace in the world.”
“We study to acquire knowledge, cultivate our minds and refine ourselves. Now that our family is harmonious, it is our duty to serve the country. This place is impoverished and cannot bear the label of a prosperous era. Therefore, let us stay here as the Emperor suggested, working together in unity, overcoming challenges, and transforming it into a prosperous era. What do you think?”
Hu Jun tightly grasped Yang Chengxuan’s hand and nodded, saying, “I understand, and we are not alone! We are not alone in this endeavor!”
Capital, Wuying Hall.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the memorial from Hu Jun and Yang Chengxuan, his eyes showing a mixture of admiration and boundless anger.
The officials beneath him really disregard his orders! It has been several months since the heavy taxes were abolished, yet there are still people openly collecting them! Forcing people to sell their land and daughters!
Even in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are close to the capital, if it were further away, wont they treat themselves as local emperor?
“Inform the Grand Secretariat, hold the court tomorrow!” Zhu Yunwen said angrily.
Shuangxi was somewhat surprised and hurriedly went to convey the message to the Grand Secretariat.
The three members of the Grand Secretariat, Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin, exchanged glances and felt the Emperor’s anger.
Since Zhu Yunwen changed the court meeting time, he had never convened an impromptu court session. This was the first time!
“It seems that the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has angered His Majesty,” Yu Xin sighed.
Zhang Dan picked up a teacup, took a sip of hot tea, and said, “Little did we know, the local officials and gentry at the prefectural and county levels had so many issues. If even one of them is mishandled, the disasters of the Hongwu era may reoccur. The two of you should consider how to appease the thunderous wrath of His Majesty.”
The disasters of the Hongwu reign referred to Zhu Yuanzhang’s brutal methods.
When it came to corrupt officials, Zhu Yuanzhang had only one method: execution.
You’re corrupt? Off with your head. Let’s see how you can be corrupt without a head.
Violence couldn’t solve the problem, but can’t it solve you?
Kill one, replace with another, continue to be corrupt, kill again!
The Hongwu era was filled with bloodshed, and surviving officials were like those whose ancestral graves were on fire, praying for their safety every day.
Although Emperor Jianwen, Zhu Yunwen, possesses benevolence and virtue. Following the footsteps of one’s grandfather is not an impossible task.
Xie Jin picked up a copy of Hu Jun’s memorial and carefully read it, saying, “Let me speak. It is inevitable for the Emperor to wield the butcher’s knife, but this butcher’s knife may not necessarily be aimed at the grain administrators, village heads, militia leaders, or county officials.”
Zhang Dan furrowed his brows and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”
Xie Jin pointed to the memorial and said, “This Hu Jun is quite insightful. Although he comes from the Imperial Academy, he is not rigid and is adaptable. Look at this sentence, ‘The root cause of corruption lies in the local gentry, who greedily monopolize the land, with millions of acres unable to satisfy their desires.’ And then this sentence, ‘The rich have vast fields while the poor have no place to stand.'”
“It is evident that the farmers in the prefectures and counties are not living easy lives. His Majesty has always advocated for problem-solving, not people-solving, as the case of the King of Yan demonstrated. In my opinion, this knife may very well fall on the land.”

Chapter 59: They’re All Landlords…
“In the regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is common to see peasants being forced to sell their land at low prices and become tenant farmers. In order to avoid heavy taxes and to survive, many resorted to entrusting their land under the name of the officials and wealthy gentry, this has become prevalent…”
“If we do not find a way to restrain this phenomenon, the land of the entire country will become the land of officials and gentry, and the farmers of the entire country will become the farmers of officials and gentry!”
During the court assembly, Fang Xiaoru read aloud Hu Jun’s memorial titled “A Petition on Behalf of the Million People in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.”
Zhu Yunwen’s face darkened as he scanned the courtiers and shouted sternly, “On the Lantern Festival, We promised prosperity for the people! Yet, within ten days, We receive such a memorial. Haha, is this the true state of Great Ming? How can We face the world with such shame? Huang Zicheng, as the Minister of Revenue, what is your view on this matter?”
Huang Zicheng stepped forward and bowed, saying, “Your Majesty, every word in Hu Jun’s memorial is deeply alarming. I believe that if the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is true as described by Hu Jun and others, with land consolidation and the trend of entrusting the land under another name, the court should implement strict measures and investigate the lands of the gentry to impose restrictions.”
Zhou De, the left assistant censor-in-chief from the Censorate, stood up and opposed, “Investigation? Officials are exempt from land taxes on their official salaries, while wealthy farmers and gentry enjoy partial tax exemptions on their land. This is the system established by Emperor Taizu! Your Majesty, I believe that poor agricultural management or crop failures leading to financial ruin is a common occurrence among farmers. By relying on the support of the gentry, they can sustain their production and livelihood. The words of Hu Jun are excessive and intended to intimidate the court. He should be punished accordingly!”
Huang Zicheng turned abruptly, his anger rising. I, a Minister of Revenue, haven’t finished speaking yet, and now you, a mere assistant censor, dare to interrupt?
“Assistant Censor Zhou’s words are reasonable, Your Majesty. Throughout history, farmers have depended on land, and land depends on the wealthy landlords and the government. Even if some self-cultivating farmers become tenant farmers, it may not necessarily be a bad thing. After all, they still have land to cultivate, and the court only needs to collect the corresponding taxes and silver. Taxes and silver are not in short supply, and everything can be resolved.”
Fan Jun, the right assistant censor-in-chief from the Censorate, stepped forward to support Zhou De.
Huang Zicheng grew furious, retorting sharply, “If the common people have no self-cultivated land and completely depend on the gentry, then whom they belong to, are they the court’s, Great Ming’s, or the gentry’s? Assistant Censors Zhou and Fan, you should know that even if tenant farmers produce two dan of grain per mu, they still have to submit one dan, or even one dan and five dou!”
“Aren’t there still five dou left? They won’t starve!” Zhou De said coldly.
Huang Zicheng clenched his fists and shouted, “According to the Single Whip Method, if they cultivate the land themselves, they only need to submit one dou and three sheng of grain as agricultural tax for two dan of grain! “
“Just one dou and three sheng? Haha, Minister Huang, according to the system established by the founder, the agricultural tax is only 1/30, so for two dan of grain, it should be six sheng at most. Why has it increased to one dou and three sheng?” Zhou De counter-questioned.
Huang Zicheng exclaimed, “With the Single Whip Method, the agricultural tax has been reduced from 1/30 to 1/15. This matter has already been decided by the court! Why do you bring it up again? The Grand Secretariat has explained it clearly and even provided investigations from North and South Zhili. Although the agricultural tax seems low at thirty percent, the various corvées imposed on the people each year have long exceeded 1/10, even reaching 1/7 or 1/5!”
“With the Single Whip Method, although the agricultural tax appears to increase, it actually reduces the burden on the farmers, eliminating various corvées and disturbances. Zhou De, you should know that tenant farmers pay 1/2 ratio! Yet, you still support such outrageous actions and even utter the phrase ‘they won’t starve.’ Are you truly serving the people as an official?!”
Huang Zicheng was furious. He had seen reports from South and North Zhili, as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The number of self-cultivating farmers in the lower class had sharply decreased by at least thirty percent compared to ten years ago. In other words, out of one million self-cultivating farmers, at least three hundred thousand had lost their land!
These lost lands were not the result of their poor management but the result of collusion among the gentry. Under the guise of adhering to the old system, they repeatedly levied taxes and imposed corvées. Using various means, the self-cultivating farmers had already lost their means of sustenance. At this point, what else could they do?
They sold their own land at extremely low prices, and in turn, they sold themselves and their families!
Selling their lives was only the first step; in the years to come, they would no longer be humans but cattle, horses, and donkeys!
Subject to beatings and humiliation, tirelessly working on the land, devoid of freedom!
Huang Zicheng was enraged by the methods used against the lower class, but as the Minister of Revenue, he cared more about tax revenue. The conversion of three hundred thousand self-cultivating farmers into tenant farmers meant a significant loss of tax revenue for the court!
Calculating at ten mu per person, it amounted to three million mu of land. According to the old system of 1/30 tax, collecting six sheng of grain tax per mu would yield nearly eighteen thousand dan of grain, and this was the lowest estimate. The actual figure was likely several times higher.
After all, the officials have their official fields, which are exempt from taxation. And during the time of Zhu Yuanzhang, the court even granted partial tax exemptions to the wealthy gentry.
All the land of the common people has fallen into their hands, yet they either pay no taxes or pay minimal taxes. How can the Ministry of Revenue collect taxes under such circumstances?
In this situation, don’t talk about single whip method, even if you break the whip, you still can’t strike the gentry!
Although the Single Whip Method has protected self-cultivating farmers and prevented the gentry from forcefully seizing and plundering. the lower class has its own methods. The madness over land among these people cannot be suppressed!
Unless the court implements strict policies!
These officials from the Censorate, one after another, talk nonsense and believe that the conversion of self-cultivating farmers into tenant farmers is a good thing. They even think that the gentry has done good deeds!
In the end, it’s all about interests!
Behind these officials, there must be a large amount of land.
They are speaking out to protect their own interests!
Not to mention, during the implementation of the Single Whip Method, although it hasn’t yet affected their interests, it has already raised their vigilance. They are opposing it now to hold back the court and avoid further investigations!
The court is in a state of turmoil, with no definite conclusion.
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze is cold. When he thinks about it, these people are officials, but once they take off their official robes, they are all landlords…
Those who came from humble backgrounds and entered the court have also become landlords by buying and occupying land. As landlords, it is only natural for them to protect their own interests.
But these landlords are too greedy. They want to eat the meat, gnaw the bones, and take away even the dregs of the fertile land, without giving a single bit to the court!
These people, who study the teachings of the sages, have become no different from ruffians when it comes to taking action.
They have double standards.
Well, very well!
Since these new landlords disregard martial virtue, then let them bear the consequences.
“Enough!”
Zhu Yunwen shouts loudly.
The court falls silent, and the ministers who were standing in the wrong positions also return to their places.
Zhu Yunwen solemnly says, “Hu Jun’s memorial will be copied five times by the Grand Secretariat and ten times by the six ministries! The remaining will copy twenty times! Let it be transcribed here! This matter will be further discussed tomorrow.”
The eunuchs, unsure of whether to announce “the end of the court session,” look at Zhu Yunwen and hesitate.
Seeing this, the ministers kneel and shout their salutations.
Xie Jin instructed the palace attendants to prepare writing brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones, wearing a smile on his face. Yu Xin and Zhang Dan also relaxed, at least the Emperor didn’t mention anything about executing someone. That made things easier to handle.
Yu Xin holds Hu Jun’s memorial and says, “What Hu Jun said is correct. If the issue of land in the prefectures and counties is not addressed, there may not be any immediate chaos, but a hundred years later, it will become a great problem.”
“Heh, it’s not easy to solve this problem.”
Zhang Dan furrows his brow and sighs.
Xie Jin looks at Zhang Dan’s worried expression, leans closer, and whispers, “Official Zhang, are you implying that the royal family occupies the most land? Hehe, believe it or not, the officials in the Six Ministries will make this matter clear tomorrow.”

Chapter 60: The Two Kings Practicing Medicine at the Training Ground
In the capital city, at the small training ground.
Ru Chang, the Minister of War, watched the soldiers of the imperial army as they trained. His usually gloomy face showed a slight improvement.
The soldiers were fierce and courageous, with a strong determination to expand the borders and defend the nation.
The cavalry was formidable, aspiring to achieve victories and be rewarded with noble titles.
The new military policies not only emphasized individual combat skills and improved daily training but also focused on improving the formation of the army, constantly researching how to use infantry to counter cavalry and even cavalry to counter cavalry.
Some previously inconspicuous veteran soldiers displayed exceptional abilities within these new strategies and were promoted through continuous assessments.
Ru Chang held two individuals in high regard: Li De and Liu Qixia, who had risen from ordinary soldiers to the rank of battalion commander.
Li De excelled in defensive warfare and, while studying military formations, created a method of coordinated combat using multiple weapons. His strategy involved a large formation consisting of musketeers, archers, spear-wielders, shield-bearers, and infantry.
When faced with enemy cavalry, the musketeers would take the forefront, unleashing a volley of shots. Then the archers would cover the area with arrows, while the spear-wielders would confront and repel the enemy’s horses. The shield-bearers would guard the formation, and the infantry would launch attacks.
The infantry formation, which has repeatedly proven effective against cavalry, has been practiced hundreds of times and is considered fundamentally mature. The plan has been submitted to the Ministry of War and the Five Army Commandery, awaiting full-scale implementation across the entire army.
On the other hand, Liu Qixia excelled in cavalry tactics and was known for his swift assaults and fierce battles.
Recognizing the strength of the Jurchen’s Jin Dynasty “Iron Pagoda Cavalry” and “Guaizi ma[1]The Guaizi Ma (simplified Chinese: 拐子马; traditional Chinese: 拐子馬; pinyin: guǎizi mǎ) is a military formation that was allegedly used by … Continue reading,” he devoted his efforts to creating a hundred heavily armored cavalry units modeled after the “Iron Pagoda Cavalry.” Their helmets were incredibly sturdy, revealing only their eyes, and instead of connecting with leather thongs, the heavy armor was paired with longswords for steady advancement.
The remaining nine hundred cavalry units were light cavalry, mainly focused on rapid flanking attacks and rear assaults.
Whether it was Li De’s strategy or Liu Qixia’s cavalry formations, both had their merits. However, in Ru Chang’s view, heavy armored cavalry was not suitable for defending against the northern Mongol enemies.
The reason was simple: heavy armored cavalry had slow movement speed. While it could be effective in siege breaking, but the northern Mongol enemies didn’t have well-fortified camps. If they couldn’t keep up with the speed during battles or retreat, they would be at a disadvantage.
However, after discussing the matter with Xu Huizu, Ru Chang did not give up on Liu Qixia’s strategy.
Xu Huizu believed that having a heavy cavalry unit would be advantageous. They could serve as a personal guard and spearhead in charging formations. Most importantly, if the vassal kings ever posed a threat to the capital, this military force could also play a role.
The most significant change brought by the new military policies was revitalizing the capital garrison, allowing soldiers to voice their opinions and encouraging them to study and experiment with new tactics. With the incentive of assessments and rewards for excellence, the entire Capital garrison worked diligently day and night, constantly honing their skills. Their combat prowess had become quite formidable!
Ru Chang stood on the high platform, watching the training of the new army, his eyes filled with satisfaction.
Suddenly, several soldiers let out a cry of pain. Ru Chang quickly turned to look and saw five soldiers trapped under a fallen barbed wire fence, unable to move. He hurriedly walked over and discovered that the wooden stakes supporting the barbed wire had snapped, causing it to fall and injure the soldiers.
“Why aren’t you rescuing them?”
Ru Chang approached and saw the soldiers who had come over but were not lifting the barbed wire. He couldn’t help but become furious.
Before the soldiers could respond, voices could be heard from a distance.
“Don’t move, don’t move.”
The familiar voice caught Ru Chang’s attention, and when he turned his head, he saw King of Liao Zhu Zhi and King of Min Zhu Geng approaching. They were accompanied by twenty attendants carrying wooden boxes and sticks, hurrying over.
Ru Chang’s eyes widened, feeling somewhat dazed.
These two kings didn’t go to the Qinhuai River. Instead, they came to the small training ground?
Ru Chang looked up at the sun and muttered in frustration, “The sun is still up. What’s going on?”
“Haha, someone got hurt again!”
Zhu Geng shouted with a smug expression, filled with excitement.
Ru Chang’s beard seemed to bristle on its own as he glared at Zhu Geng. This guy had no conscience at all. He was actually so happy when soldiers got injured?
Zhu Zhi, being a bit more mature, greeted Ru Chang and said, “official Ru, please don’t blame the soldiers. It was my order. If a soldier gets injured, they must not act rashly and should inform us immediately so that we can quickly provide medical treatment.”
Ru Chang’s eyes were about to pop out of his head.
Provide medical treatment?
You, Zhu Zhi?
And your brother, Zhu Geng?
The only thing you two can treat is the emptiness of Ladies at Qinhuai River, um, their money pouch.
Do you think I don’t know what kind of people you are?
A person who can visit the Qingyan Tower three times in ten days claims to understand medical skills?
Is three times too little?
No, these are just the number of times of entering. Once inside, they do not leave but instead stay overnight at the Qingyan Tower.
The court has received numerous memorials impeaching the improper conduct of the two kings, with many ministers strongly urging Zhu Yunwen to send them away from the capital and assign them to their fiefdoms.
But those memorials have never had any effect.
It is said that the Emperor gave an order to the Grand Secretariat, stating that any memorials regarding the two kings should not be presented to him.
Many of those memorials probably ended up being thrown into the brazier by Xie Jin for warmth.
Ignorant and lacking in virtue, indulging in worldly pleasures, these have become the unanimous view of courtiers towards the two kings.
Ru Chang didn’t have much of an opinion about Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng. Although it was a problem that they were staying in the capital instead of being assigned to fiefdoms, ultimately it was the Emperor’s private matter.
Besides, these two guys…
Apart from staying overnight in brothels and inviting art troupes to their homes for several days, they hadn’t done anything particularly outrageous. There were no rumors of them stealing someone’s wife, beating someone’s child, or owing money to any brothels.
Zhu Zhi, seeing Ru Chang’s silence, directed his attendants to check the soldiers’ injuries. Fortunately, it was still the first month of the year and the soldiers were wearing wooden armor, so their vital areas were not injured. Two soldiers had grazes on their heads, and three soldiers had cuts on their hands. The most severe case had a wire almost piercing through the palm of his hand.
“You lift this side, you go to that side, you stay here. Be gentle with your movements, apply pressure along the direction of the wound. In this soldier’s case, the wire is diagonally inserted into the wound, so you need to exert force in that direction. Understand?” Zhu Zhi instructed his attendants.
After the attendants understood, Zhu Zhi told the soldiers to lift the barbed wire and the soldiers gritted their teeth holding.
“Hurry, drag them out. Prepare clean water, alcohol, and gauze.”
Zhu Zhi quickly called out.
Other attendants stepped forward and pulled out five soldiers. The attendant on the side had already opened a wooden box, and two person formed a team, surrounding each soldier. They first cleaned the wounds with clean water and then brought out alcohol.
“Wait!”
Ru Chang couldn’t take it anymore and shouted loudly, looking at those glass bottles of alcohol. He exclaimed, “What is this? How can you use it on the soldiers’ bodies?”
Zhu Zhi took the alcohol bottle from the attendant’s hand, opened it, and shook it in front of Ru Chang, saying, “This is called alcohol. It has the effect of reducing swelling and preventing pus. Just pouring a little on the wound, even in the scorching summer, the wound is less likely to get infected.”
“How can we use an unknown substance? What if it harms the soldiers? What will we do then?” Ru Chang was unwilling to try it and looked at the two kings with a cold face. He said, “Your Highnesses, I think it would be better to send the soldiers to the medical officer.”
“Medical officer?”
Zhu Zhi chuckled and without backing down, he said, “Minister, there are 50,000 soldiers in this small training ground, but we only have five medical officers! Five! And just during the drill, over a dozen soldiers fell off their horses and were already sent there. There are also several with fractures who were also sent there. When do you think these few soldiers will have their wounds attended to after being sent there?”
Ru Chang’s face turned red.
The number of medical officers in the Ming Dynasty’s capital army was truly pitiful. One medical officer for every 10,000 soldiers.
Not only in the capital garrison, but also throughout the Ming Dynasty, there were not many excellent medical officers.
In some places, it might take several days and nights to walk in search of a doctor for one’s wife and children, and by the time they found one, the person might have already died.
Even if the wife and children were still alive and a doctor was successfully found, they might die by the doctor’s treatment.
There’s nothing that can be done. Although it’s difficult to produce talents in this profession, the entry barrier is very low. You have suffered…

Chapter 61: Learning the ways of merchants and traders from Qingyan Tower…
During the Ming Dynasty, there were too many quack doctors. Even cats and dogs who held ancient medical books dared to prescribe medicine and treat patients, whether the patient lived or died, it’s all matter of luck.
If you’re cured, you must thank the doctor and their entire family.
If you died, you still have to thank the doctor and their entire family.
There is no way around it. This is fate, the fate of the people of the Ming Dynasty, and the fate of the Ming soldiers!
Ru Chang didn’t want his soldiers to thank the two kings and their entire families, it’s because these two king are too unreliable. These two kings, who had been idling around, suddenly became knowledgeable in medicine?
Could it be that their frequent visit to Qingyan Tower was for the purpose of discussing medical skills?
“Let them give it a try!”
A calm voice resonated in Ru Chang’s ears.
Ru Chang turned his head and saw Xu Huizu standing next to the injured soldier, holding a bottle of alcohol in his hand and sniffing its scent.
“Duke of Wei, isn’t this inappropriate?” Ru Chang expressed his concerns.
Xu Huizu turned to Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, and asked seriously, “Are you sure this substance is not poisonous?”
Zhu Zhi replied confidently, “Absolutely non-toxic.”
“But do you have any evidence?” Xu Huizu asked.
Zhu Zhi felt frustrated and asked, “Duke of Wei, this is just alcohol. How can it be poisonous? It’s just a secret method to make the alcohol purer.”
Xu Huizu pondered for a moment.
“I have evidence!”
Zhu Geng picked up a bottle of alcohol, opened it, and took a sip, letting out a satisfied exhale of alcohol fumes. He chuckled and said, “How about now? Can you trust us?”
Watching Zhu Geng, who seemed to still want more, Xu Huizu and Ruyan exchanged a glance and remained silent.
Zhu Zhi secretly extended his hand and praised Zhu Geng, then personally took the alcohol and said to the injured soldier, “As a member of the Great Ming’s Iron Army, you must endure the pain.”
The soldier thanked the king for his concern and assured him that it would be fine.
The alcohol was poured into the wound, and the soldier’s eyes widened momentarily. His hand trembled violently, and he let out a cry of pain, startling Ru Chang and Xu Huizu. Fortunately, it was only for a moment, and the soldier quickly regained composure, looking at Zhu Zhi with a mix of gratitude and lingering fear.
“Haha, don’t worry, it’s okay. Come, bring the gauze!”
Zhu Zhi personally took out the gauze and wrapped it around the wound, then said, “During this time, you must not let the wound come into contact with water, understood? In a few days, I will come to change the gauze and examine the wound.”
Xu Huizu held the gauze carefully and examined it, then turned to Ru Chang and said, “I’ve never seen anything like this before, neither gauze nor cloth. What is this, King of Liao?”
Ru Chang also held the gauze, looking towards the two kings.
Zhu Zhi smiled and said, “This is a new item called medical gauze, combined with alcohol. As long as it is used to cover the wound, it can reduce the risk of infection and promote faster healing. Moreover, when the gauze is removed, it does not adhere to the wound like coarse cloth. It is simple and practical.”
Xu Huizu took a deep breath and looked at Ru Chang.
Ru Chang also looked at Xu Huizu, his eyes filled with anticipation and longing.
If what Zhu Zhi said was true, then this alcohol and medical gauze could effectively address the issue of soldier’s injuries.
In future battles, if the soldiers were wounded, they would no longer be at risk of infection and the resulting complications. If they could solve the high mortality rate among wounded soldiers, then Ming Dynasty would have a larger number of veterans soldiers!
The value of veteran soldiers was immeasurable!
Even if Xu Huizu were given ten new recruits, he wouldn’t trade them for a single veteran soldier!
“Come, take them away,” said Zhu Zhi, The attendants brought out two folded wooden poles and separated them, revealing strips of thick cloth and ropes in between. They placed the injured soldiers on the makeshift stretcher, making them lie down. With one attendant in front and one behind, they lifted the stretcher and walked away, leaving casually.
Ru Chang rubbed his eyes and asked Xu Huizu, “Those soldiers seemed to have injuries on their hands, why couldn’t they use their legs?”
Xu Huizu ignored Ru Chang and carefully examined the two wooden poles from Zhu Zhi’s attendants. He asked Zhu Zhi, “What is this?”
Zhu Zhi wiped his hands and replied, “This is called a stretcher. It can be used to carry wounded soldiers. You know, in all the thousands of years of warfare, why do they always carry soldiers on their shoulders or back? Do you know that some wounded soldiers who could have been saved ended up dying because of the jostling? Tragic… So, after a deep and intimate discussion with King of Min, we have come up with this solution…”
Zhu Geng nearly jumped up, deep and intimate discussion, my dear brother, what did you just say?
Didn’t you see that Xu Huizu and Ru Chang had taken two steps back?
You don’t want your dignity but I still need it!
Xu Huizu, in deep thought, looked at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng and smiled. He didn’t say anything further and walked with Ru Chang toward a nearby pavilion. Turning back, he glanced at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng, who seemed to be waiting like predators, ready to tend to their soldiers once someone got injured.
“What are these two kings up to?” Ru Chang couldn’t shake off the feeling that these two kings had ulterior motives.
Xu Huizu pondered for a moment and said, “Ru Chang, you may not know this, but these two kings have been coming in and out of the capital garrison for some time now. Just a few days ago, they even went to the large training ground outside the city. I’ve heard that the Jinwu Guard and Imperial Guard in the city have also been visited by them.”
“Oh, why?” Ru Chang asked curiously.
Xu Huizu chuckled and replied, “We don’t know yet, but I’ve been to the training ground. The wounds of those injured soldiers were treated by them and didn’t show any signs of infection or even inflammation.”
Ru Chang stroked his beard, squinting his eyes as he looked at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng running off into the distance. He spoke in a deep voice, “These two kings seem different from what the rumors say.”
Xu Huizu nodded slightly, indicating his agreement.
As vassal kings, their status was highly esteemed. Coming to the capital garrison personally, running around, and caring for the soldiers, their motives were indeed difficult to discern.
“Ru Chang, if alcohol and medical gauze prove to be effective in healing the wounded, then these items should be included in military supplies, equipped in the capital guards, and even spread throughout the entire army, especially in the border regions!” Xu Huizu said earnestly.
Ru Chang understood their value and said, “Let’s arrange for medical officers to investigate. If they prove to be effective, these items should become essential in the military.”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng sat under a large tree, smiling at each other.
Zhu Geng unfastened his water flask from his waist and handed it to Zhu Zhi, saying, “So many days have passed, shouldn’t they have realized something by now? Why hasn’t anyone come to us to buy? is our approach wrong? Should we be more proactive?”
Zhu Zhi accepted the flask without hesitation and took a few sips of water. With a smile on his lips, he replied, “Proactive? Have you ever seen salt sellers who go door-to-door? What we have here is a treasure, just like salt. If we go to them, they might think we are begging them. It’s better to let them come to us.”
Zhu Geng admired him and remarked, “Fifteenth Brother, when did you become so knowledgeable in the ways of merchants?”
Zhu Zhi took another sip of water, his gaze deep and thoughtful. “The ladies with the red signboards in Qingyan tower, don’t they all do the same? The more we actively pursue, the less we’ll obtain…”.
Zhu Geng blinked his eyes, realizing that his elder brother had indeed learned a lot from those ladies.
No, as his brother, how could he lag behind?
He had to have ambition and strive forward!
Determined, Zhu Geng made up his mind to stay at Qingyan tower tonight and learn the ways of merchants!

Chapter 62: Asking the Emperor to persuade the Emperor……
The court meeting lasted for five consecutive days, but there was still no consensus on the issues of land consolidation and the trend of land donation. Instead, two distinct factions emerged.
One faction, led by Minister of Justice Hou Tai, and The Censorate left censor in chief Jing Qing, opposed the Single Whip Method and even brought the issue of land occupation to the royal family. They were essentially telling Zhu Yunwen that even the royal family occupied land, what was wrong with the gentry buying land?
They argued that the self-sustaining farmers had nothing to eat or drink, while the gentry used their money to buy land. The land deeds are clear and transparent, and use the land they bought to support their entire family.  The court wanted to restrict land purchase?
On what basis?
As officials, weren’t they all after these few acres of land? If they were restricted, wouldn’t everyone be left hanging?
Moreover, this was an ancestral system. Even when your grandfather was alive he didn’t say anything about it. But now, as soon as you came to power, you caused trouble. What did you mean by that?
The other faction, led by Minister of Revenue Huang Zicheng, and Minister of Personnel Qi Tai, supported the court’s adoption of restrictive measures to limit the malicious occupation of land by the gentry. They aimed to protect the interests of self-sustaining farmers and called for increased efforts in clearing and redistributing land.
Anyone who opposes will have their official land holdings investigated – how many mu of land they have, how they acquired it. If there are any fraudulent or illegal means involved, they should be dismissed from their positions and the land returned to the self-sustaining farmers. If the land was acquired through proper channels, they should still pay agricultural taxes. Why? Because these purchased lands are not your official land holdings!
As for the three old foxes in the Grand Secretariat, they stand at the forefront every day, yawning, not helping or taking care of anything. Once Zhu Yunwen leaves, they rub their drowsy eyes and conscientiously take out their brushes and inkstones to transcribe Hu Jun’s petition “A Plea for the People of Jiangsu and Zhejiang”.
There’s no way around it. Today is already the twenty-first transcription, and they have even memorized it.
Xiejin doesn’t mind; transcribing is just a matter of copying books, his old trade. Besides, he only does it five times a day.
The secretaries of the six ministries look at each other with ease, as they only have to do it ten times, Easy.
But the poor remaining officials, one by one, have to transcribe it twenty times.
There were a few unfortunate souls from the Censorate who made mistakes while transcribing yesterday, accidentally writing a few “homophonic characters”. They were summoned to the Wuying Hall by the Emperor and reprimanded for half an hour. It is said that they were even punished to transcribe the petition “A Plea for the People of Jiangsu and Zhejiang” fifty times.
Fifty times! Who knows if these guys even got any rest last night.
After transcribing it once, Xiejin casually took out four copies of the transcribed petition from his sleeve, to the surprise of Yuxin and Zhang Dan.
Yuxin pointed at Xiejin, almost shouting “You’re cheating,” but couldn’t say it.
Xiejin casually handed the transcribed memorial to the eunuch responsible for collecting and organizing the memorials and left the Fengtian Hall with a hearty laugh.
Zhang Dan smiled and said, “Genius Xie, are truly extraordinary. We are falling behind…”
Yuxin sighed, as Xie Jin had already anticipated that there would be no conclusive outcome in today’s court session, and the Emperor would still order them to transcribe. So Xie Jin had prepared the transcriptions in advance, ready to submit them when the time came.
It seems that among the three secretaries of the Grand Secretariat, Xie Jin understands the Emperor the best.
In the Grand Secretariat, Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin were discussing the issue of land consolidation. At that moment, Ru Chang entered the Grand Secretariat carrying a wooden box and placed it on the table with. He said, “Esteemed secretaries, I, Ru Chang, have come to seek a way of survival for the countless soldiers.”
Xie Jin and the others furrowed their brows, not understanding his intentions.
Yuxin stood up, walked to the wooden box, patted it, and asked, “Official Ru, please explain the situation clearly.”
Ru Chang opened the wooden box, revealing neatly stacked bundles of medical gauze and a bottle of alcohol in one corner, along with a small pair of scissors.
Xie Jin and the others remained silent but took out the medical gauze, examining and smelling it, still unsure of its purpose. Even if it were scraps of fabric, it seemed too small and flimsy. This material was soft and light, unsuitable even for hanging.
“This gauze is called medical gauze, and the bottle contains alcohol,” Ru Chang explained earnestly. “When soldiers are injured, they only need to pour alcohol on the wound and use the gauze to stop bleeding. This can prevent the wounds from becoming infected and promote faster healing. It is an essential military necessity. As the Minister of War, I cannot neglect the well-being of two million soldiers. I earnestly request your full support.”
Xie Jin and the others looked at Ru Chang, who was showing his sincerity through his salute, and they became serious as well.
Zhang Dan held a piece of gauze and asked, “Is it really so miraculous?”
Ru Chang took out a document from his pocket and handed it over, saying, “This is a joint statement signed by twenty medical officers from the Capital Garrison, guaranteeing the effectiveness of the medical gauze and alcohol in preventing suppuration and promoting healing. I have personally witnessed and applied them, so there is no possibility of deception.”
Xie Jin wrinkled his brow after smelling the alcohol and asked, “Isn’t this just distilled liquor?”
Ru Chang shook his head and said, “I have inquired at all the taverns in the capital, but none of them can produce such potent distilled liquor.”
“Wait, where did these come from?” Yuxin asked.
Ru Chang’s expression became somewhat uneasy, and he sighed before saying, “They were provided by King of Liao, Zhu Zhi, and King of Min, Zhu Geng. Even this medical gauze was provided by them.”
“The two kings? That’s hardly possible,” Xie Jin expressed his doubt.
He knew well the character and expertise of those two kings. Could they really produce these things?
Xie Jin was highly skeptical.
Ru Chang bowed again and said, “Regardless of who provided them, these items should be included in the military supplies and distributed to the Capital Garrison, border troops, and various garrisons!”
Yuxin, with a somewhat perplexed expression, asked, “Since these items belong to the two kings, why not have them present them? Why bring them to the Grand Secretariat?”
Ru Chang raised his head, wearing a pained expression, and said, “Because these items are only for sale, not for donation.”
“What?” Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin were all astonished.
Only for sale, not for donation?
Doesn’t that make them profit-seeking merchants?
As noble kings of the Ming Dynasty, sons of the founding emperor, and uncles of the emperor himself, engaging in commerce would be a disgraceful act.
After all, the founding emperor left behind the ancestral teachings that all future descendants must not engage in business!
What are these two kings up to?
Ru Chang’s eyes revealed a sense of sorrow. He himself had worn the same expression at first. Who could have imagined that these noble kings would turn into mere traders, devoid of any sense of patriotism or concern for the people and the military.
At first, Ru Chang also wanted to take a tough stance, but the problem was that they couldn’t find another business in the entire capital that could provide alcohol. When he found a household selling distilled liquor, he asked if they could distill it a few more times to make it stronger, and then inquired if three mace of silver would be enough. However, they were promptly driven away.
They visited every cloth shop in the capital, but no one had ever seen medical gauze, let alone replicated it.
The two kings had exclusive supply rights. If the Ministry of War wanted the items, they could only buy them with money.
The unscrupulous two kings actually demanded one tael of silver for a single wooden box.
The thought of his own one tael of silver made Ru Chang’s heart ache.
“Please, have the Grand Secretariat persuade the two kings to present the method of making medical gauze and alcohol for the sake of protecting our soldiers of the Ming Dynasty.” Ru Chang pleaded.
Yuxin and Zhang Dan both turned their gaze to Xie Jin. Xie Jin looked at them gloomily and said, “This matter concerns two million soldiers and the foundation of our nation. It might be best for official Ru to report it to his majesty and let his majesty act as the mediator.”
In the Jinshen Hall, Zhu Yunwen looked at Ru Chang’s memorial and almost burst out laughing.
Well.
Let me convince myself to present the things I’ve painstakingly acquired?
I agree, but the Empress does not agree!
PS:
I need to clarify that during the Ming Dynasty, the position of Minister of the Six Ministries was sometimes not held by a single person. Zhu Yuanzhang, in order to distribute power, appointed multiple officials to the position of Minister of each ministry. Having seven or eight officials or even more was normal.
During the reign of Emperor Jianwen, the number of officials serving as Ministers was between one and four.
At this time, the Minister of Justice was shared between Bao Zhao and Hou Tai.

Chapter 63: Four words: Ah, Merchants are Good
The people from the office of transmission brought the memorial back to the Ministry of War, Ru Chang eagerly opened the memorial and his gaze fell upon Zhu Yunwen’s reply, and his eyes widened instantly with a face full of confusion and unease.
Liu Jun, the Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, approached with a document in hand and asked, “Official, did His Majesty grant the request?”
Ru Chang shook his head and handed over the memorial.
After reading it, Liu Jun also became puzzled and asked in bewilderment, “What does his Majesty mean?”
Ru Chang let out a sigh, took the memorial, and said, “I’m not sure either. This matter needs to be discussed with the Grand Secretariat. Do you have something else?”
Liu Jun quickly handed over the document in his hand and said, “Assistant Commander Qi Bin from Deng Prefecture Guards reported that there have been small groups of pirates appearing in the coastal areas of Shandong, plundering and killing more than thirty coastal military and civilians. Asking an order from Ministry of War to allocate ships and go to sea to eliminate the enemy.”
Ru Chang quickly took the report and examined it carefully, asking, “No wonder the report was sent to the Ministry of War instead of the Five Armies Commandery. Official Liu, do you know who this General Mingwei Qi Bin’s father is?”
“Naturally, I know. He was a Company Commander of the Yingtian Guard, a personal guard of Emperor Taizu, and a founding general, Qi Xiang. It’s a pity that Qi Xiang while on an expedition to Yunnan…”
Liu Jun’s eyes revealed a hint of regret.
After carefully reading the memorial, Ru Chang said, “Perfect timing. Take this memorial to the Grand Secretariat for further review.”
Grand Secretariat.
Xie Jin was flipping through the opening of “The Records of Emperor Taizu” and asked Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, “Who was the chief author of this book?”
Yu Xin shook his head, busying himself with the memorials in his hands, and said, “The Hanlin Academy reader in waiting Dong Lun? Chief editor Wang Jingzhang? If you want to know, you’ll have to visit the Hanlin Academy.”
Xie Jin narrowed his eyes and said, “Dong Lun’s writing style is sincere and conservative, and Wang Jingzhang’s arguments adhere to traditional rules. The opening of this book is definitely not the work of either of them.”
“Oh, you’re referring to this opening?” Fang Xiaoru entered the Grand Secretariat, rubbing his slightly cold, aged face and breath his hands, saying, “It was written by Hanlin Junior Historiography Compiler, Yang Shiqi.”
“Yang Shiqi?”
Xie Jin squinted his eyes, pondering the name, and then set the opening manuscript aside, solemnly saying, “This individual is a talent! In the future, he may not be inferior to us!”
Yu Xin and Zhang Dan both looked up, gazing at Xie Jin.
This was not a joke, but an unusual political prophecy!
Fang Xiaoru was not surprised by Xie Jin’s words and stepped forward, saying, “I have observed Yang Shiqi for over half a month. He is an exceptional candidate, whether it’s his character, abilities, or literary and historical knowledge. Genius Xie you gained a rival.”
Xie Jin burst into laughter and, seeing Fang Xiaoru feel cold, handed him the nearby copper hand warmer, saying, “The Grand Secretariat is filled with talented individuals, and I am delighted to see it.”
Fang Xiaoru nodded with satisfaction, about to speak, when footsteps were heard outside the door. Ru Chang rushed in he saw Fang Xiaoru also here, he greeted him first, and then, after greeting the three secretaries, he handed over the report from Qi Bin.
Upon reading it, Yu Xin furrowed his brow slightly and said, “This matter, Shouldn’t we inform the Five Army Commandery about this matter since the Deng Prefecture Guards falls under their jurisdiction?”
Zhang Dan pondered for a moment and said, “The Deng Prefecture Guard belongs to the Shandong Military Command and is under the jurisdiction of the Left Army Commandery. Since Li Jinglong departed for Guangzhou, the matters related to the Left Army Commandery have been temporarily managed by Xu Huizu. It may be best to forward this report to Xu Huizu for further consideration.”
Ru Chang nodded slightly and then took out another memorial, smiling wryly at Xie Jin and the others, saying, “The Emperor has given his approval.”
Xie Jin’s eyebrows twitched ever so slightly, maintaining a composed demeanor.
Yu Xin squinted his eyes as he looked at Ru Chang’s expression, shaking his head slightly.
Zhang Dan reached out and took the memorial, saying, “It seems that the Emperor is not willing to be your mediator.”
Ru Chang sighed and said, “Not necessarily. The Emperor’s words seem to hold a deeper meaning, but I cannot comprehend it.”
“Oh?”
Xie Jin became interested and leaned closer.
Zhang Man unfolded the memorial from Ru Chang, which requested the Emperor to persuade the two kings to present the method of making medical gauze and alcohol. His gaze quickly scanned through it, and at the end of the memorial, there were only four characters written in cinnabar ink:
[Ah, Merchants are Good.]
Zhang Dan was immediately stunned, his expression filled with disbelief.
After reading it, Yu Xin was also puzzled, while Fang Xiaoru pondered in silence.
Only Xie Jin, who was slightly surprised, relaxed his eyebrows, sat back, and had a hint of a smile on his lips.
“What kind of response is this?” Fang Xiaoru expressed his dissatisfaction.
The emperor lacks self-respect. How can he give such ambiguous responses to official documents and ministerial memorials?
What does “Ah, Merchants are Good” mean?
Yu Xin and Zhang Dan were puzzled, and everyone turned their gaze to Xie Jin, who was sipping tea. They couldn’t help but become angry and surrounded him.
Ru Chang snatched Xie Jin’s teapot and asked, “What does the emperor really mean?”
Leaning back in his chair, Xie Jin chuckled and said, “The emperor’s meaning is simply ‘ah, merchants are good’.”
Ru Chang and others were almost fainted.
So, you’re just like the emperor, both of you playing riddles!
“What does it really mean?”
Ru Chang felt somewhat frustrated. After all, he was a high-ranking minister of the six ministries, yet he couldn’t comprehend the emperor’s intentions. How could he establish himself in the court in the future?
Xie Jin looked at Ru Chang earnestly and said, “The emperor’s meaning is simply ‘Merchants are good.’ Official Ru, you should carefully ponder and contemplate it.”
Ru Chang fell into deep thought.
Zhang Dan clapped his hands and suddenly understood. He smiled and said, “The emperor’s move is brilliant indeed. However, the Ministry of Revenue will bear the burden of this account.”
Yu Xin let out a long “Oh,” shook his head, and sat back down. He said, “The emperor is far-sighted and has grand plans. We can hardly keep up with his pace.”
Fang Xiaoru was completely puzzled. He looked at these individuals who were playing with riddles and couldn’t bring himself to ask further. He casually took the memorial and walked to the Hanlin Academy while humming an old tune, he then summoned Yang Shiqi, who was busy compiling books.
“This memorial is a test for you. If you can explain the emperor’s intentions, I will recommend you to higher authorities.”
Fang Xiaoru placed the memorial on the desk, eagerly awaiting Yang Shiqi’s response.
The main responsibilities of the Hanlin Academy are drafting imperial edicts, compiling historical records, and assisting in court lectures. They analyze current political affairs, study and review memorials in preparation for the emperor’s inquiries.
Before the change of reign to Jianwen, Yang Shiqi was recommended by local officials to serve as a compiler.
As the country’s foundation rests on the “national flag, national emblem, and national anthem,” the Grand Secretariat urgently needed the Hanlin Academy as a reserve force. Without waiting for Yang Shiqi to finish the New Year in Jiangxia, he was forced to travel downstream and enter the capital.
Yang Shiqi had a heavy task ahead. Not only did he need to participate in national foundation matters, but he also had to assist Dong Lun and others in completing the “Record of Emperor Taizu.”
Facing the test from Fang Xiaoru, Yang Shiqi smiled faintly, after paying respect, he took the memorial, carefully examined it, and then respectfully placed it on the desk. He said to Fang Xiaoru, “The emperor has given his reply.”
Fang Xiaoru leaned forward slightly and asked, “Tell me.”
Yang Shiqi pointed to the memorial and calmly said, “Minister Ru requested the emperor to be a mediator, his majesty didn’t agree, but his majesty hopes that the Ministry of War can purchase the medical gauze and alcohol in a commercial manner.”
“Oh?” Fang Xiaoru furrowed his brow and asked, “Is there more?”
Yang Shiqi continued, “The emperor’s approach has a deeper meaning. It serves the overall situation and is also a response to the land disputes within the court.”
Fang Xiaoru was stunned.
Zhu Yunwen’s simple response of “Ah, Merchants are good” imply a deeper meaning and serve a larger purpose?
Furthermore, this memorial clearly pertains to the matters between the Ministry of War, and the two kings. Where does it mention anything about land disputes?

Chapter 64: Lian Zining’s realization..
Kunning Palace.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen holding a lacquer brush in his hand, with quite a bit of paint splattered on his clothes, and couldn’t help but frown. It wouldn’t be easy to wash off.
“Empress, come and take a look at how my sand table turned out,” Zhu Yunwen said, his lips curling into a slight smile.
Ma Enhui walked over and carefully examined the miniature sand table. It didn’t depict the entire Ming Empire but rather the Nan Zhili region, including fourteen prefectures such as Ying Tian, Suzhou, Fengyang, Yangzhou, Songjiang, and Huizhou.
The entire sand table, apart from the yellow clay base color, consisted of only two colors: a large area of yellow and small scattered areas of black.
The yellow areas were mostly contiguous and concentrated, while the black areas were scattered and more dispersed.
“Your Majesty, what is this for?” Ma Enhui couldn’t understand.
Zhu Yunwen put the paintbrush back into the paint bucket and smiled, “The court are discussing land disputes, aren’t they? This is prepared to silence those people.”
Ma Enhui shook her head slightly and smiled, “I don’t quite understand, but Your Majesty always has a way. After all, it is not a good thing to have officials in constant opposition.”
Zhu Yunwen admired his masterpiece and said, “It is not good for officials to be in opposition, as it hinders the smooth implementation of policies. However, if officials have no arguments and simply obey orders without question, then even I should be afraid.”
Allowing appropriate struggles among court officials and permitting differing opinions was Zhu Yunwen’s way of governance.
Although Zhu Yunwen didn’t like Hou Tai and the officials from the Censorate, they were still mirrors of the gentry class.
People always need mirrors.
Without these mirrors, how could one see the true state of the Ming Empire?
Ma Enhui brought over a set of clothes and helped Zhu Yunwen change while saying, “I don’t want to talk about these big matters. I only care about whether our medical gauze and alcohol can be sold.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the money-minded Ma Enhui, reached out and tapped her forehead, and smiled, “Don’t worry, with Xie Jin here, Ru Chang will understand my intentions. If nothing unexpected happens, after the officials impeach the two kings, we will proceed with the trade.”
“Then it would be smooth sailing according to Your Majesty’s wishes.” Ma Enhui smiled.
Zhu Yunwen finished dressing and took Ma Enhui’s hand, looking into her beautiful eyes. He said affectionately, “I love your intelligence, but it’s unfortunate for the two kings.”
“It’s their good fortune to share Your Majesty’s worries and the worries of the Ming Dynasty.”
Ma Enhui lowered her head, her cheeks slightly blushing.
“Your Majesty, there is an urgent report from the Security Bureau.”
Shuangxi hurriedly entered and respectfully handed over a memorial.
Zhu Yunwen walked towards Shuangxi, took the memorial, and a smile appeared on his lips as he asked, “Where are the two kings?”
“They are still in the military camp, Your Majesty.”
Shuangxi replied.
Zhu Yunwen nodded with satisfaction. Although these two were born into the imperial family, they were not afraid of hardship. Since they were going to be unlucky, he decided to give them some reassurance.
“I remember there is still some ambergris in the imperial treasury. Take out half of it and give it to the two kings.”
Zhu Yunwen instructed.
Shuangxi acknowledged and left the room.
Ma Enhui walked over and complained, “Your Majesty, that’s ambergris. It’s produced from dragon saliva, and its precious and rare. Even in the capital, there are only a little over five taels. You are truly generous.”
“Dragon’s saliva?”
Zhu Yunwen blinked, looking skeptical.
Ma Enhui, with a pained expression, said, “Your Majesty, haven’t you heard? Ambergris is produced on Longxian Island. This island floats in the turbulent sea, and only when hundreds of dragons gather and play on the island during the spring, will they leave droplets of their saliva, forming ambergris. How can such a legendary treasure be given away so easily?”
“Um, has Empress been to Longxian Island?”
Zhu Yunwen felt frustrated. The imagination of people in ancient times was too rich.
Even casual fabrications were told with vivid details, including the location, animals, stories, and outcomes, and even an empress of an empire was fooled.
Ma Enhui shook her head and sighed, “Longxian Island is far overseas, elusive and unpredictable. How could I have seen it? Ambergris, ambergris, it’s said to be the saliva of a dragon. It’s such a waste to give it to the two kings.”
Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter and said, “Empress, ambergris is not actually the saliva of a dragon but a product of the sperm whale. It’s just ambergris, When Zheng He goes on his voyages, I’ll have him bring you a few catties as compensation.”
Ma Enhui couldn’t believe it. How could the sperm whale be associated with such a grand name as Ambergris? The Emperor must be trying to comfort her with kind words.
Thinking about the fragrance of the ambergris, Ma Enhui felt a sense of longing.
The fragrance of ambergris was as elegant as musk, with a subtle earthy scent, delicate and smooth, and its lingering aroma could last for months. It was rarely used in the palace on ordinary days.
As Zhu Yunwen expected, the Ministry of War prepared to purchase medical gauze and alcohol through commercial means and reported it to the Ministry of Revenue, requesting a sum of two hundred thousand taels.
Huang Zicheng, the Minister of Revenue, did not dare to neglect the matter. After careful study with the officials of the ministry, they discovered that these items were owned by the King of Liao and the King of Min. Huang Zicheng was displeased. The royal family was prohibited from engaging in commerce, which was an ancestral rule established by Zhu Yuanzhang.
It hadn’t been a year since Old Zhu passed away, and yet you all are disregarding his words?
How could a king involve himself in petty merchant affairs? This is unacceptable!
There must be an impeachment!
Moreover, they should be compelled to hand over the manufacturing methods of medical gauze and alcohol. How can such vital military resources be controlled by the Kings?
The Ministry of Revenue was like a broken window, with Huang Zicheng still contemplating and preparing the opening remarks. Meanwhile, Jing Qing, the Left Censor in chief of the Censorate, received the news and clapped his hands in delight.
These past few days had been difficult for Jing Qing. Although the land dispute had not yet been resolved, he was already in a precarious position. Every day, apart from drafting memorials, he was considering how to elegantly greet Huang Zicheng’s three generations, without losing his composure.
But it wasn’t a sustainable solution to just exchange greetings. After all, Huang Zicheng was also courteous and understood the principle of reciprocity. Every time he greeted him, he would greet him back.
Now, things were different. There would be no land dispute tomorrow, allowing them to rest for a day. First, they would impeach the kings for not following ancestral rules, for elevating commerce over noble conduct, and for lacking any sense of patriotism. Then they would accuse them of controlling the country’s essential resources for personal gain, endangering the nation and the military.
Jing Qing made the announcement, and naturally, his colleagues in the Censorate listened attentively.
Lian Zining, the Right Censor in chief, looked at the imposing figure of Jing Qing in silence and glanced at the memorial written by Hu Jun, “A Petition for the People of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.” After copying it dozens of times, Lian Zining finally changed his initial perspective.
Although Hu Jun’s words seemed alarmist, they were not baseless.
Looking back over the past ten or twenty years and observing the present, the changes are evident. If we project another thirty years ahead, it is feared that only one or two out of ten self-sustaining farmers will remain. When the imperial court wishes to obtain tax revenues, but can only extract them from these few self-sustaining farmers. minority bear the heaviest tax burden, while the majority either bear a very small portion of the tax or do not bear it at all.
If things continued like this, Lian Zining didn’t know if the lower class could survive or if they would revolt. But he knew one thing: by that time, the Ming government would likely have no money left.
In dire straits and with extreme hardships, how can it sustain itself?
Not to mention their own salaries, even in the face of natural disasters, the court cannot allocate funds for disaster relief. If a war were to break out, with internal troubles and external threats, their downfall is imminent!
Lian Zining put down the memorial, his gaze filled with a sense of worry. He picked up his pen and began to silently write the memorial “A Petition for the People of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.” Muttering to himself, he said, “The nation, the nation once it is established, the family must not be destroyed.”

Chapter 65: Does engaging in commerce bring disgrace to the royal family?
“What?!”
The same shock, the same expression, appeared in different locations.
The Grand Secretariat, the Five Army Commandery, the Six Ministries, the Hanlin Academy, the Censorate, and the mansions of various ministers, everyone was shocked by the current news.
“King of Yan, Zhu Di, has personally bound himself and pleaded guilty. He has now arrived at the Yangzhou Prefecture!”
Yu Xin, holding the report, looked at Zhang Dan and Xie Jin with anger in his tone: “Such a significant matter, Zhang Bing, as Beiping administration commissioner, didn’t even send a single memorial report. If it weren’t for the report from Yangzhou Prefecture, wouldn’t we have to wait until King of Yan arrives in the capital to be informed?!”
Xie Jin’s face gradually returned to normal, and he said, “We shouldn’t blame Zhang Bing. I believe Ping An and Sheng Yong also did not send this matter as a report to the Five Army Commandery.”
“It must be deliberate concealment by the Emperor!” Zhang Dan said solemnly.
Yu Xin frowned.
In this world, only the Emperor of Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yunwen, could make a vassal king disappear from Beiping without a trace and suddenly appear in Yangzhou.
This level of secrecy resembles the approach of a security bureau.
Xie Jin relaxed and said, “It is a good thing that the King of Yan is coming to the capital. Based on the recent memorial reports, it is evident that Ping An has gained complete control over Beiping. Zhu Gaochi and others have also abandoned their last resistance. They not only relinquished command of the King of Yan’s Three Guards but also disbanded the King of Yan’s Household Guards, retaining only a force of just over 800 men.”
“With the voluntary submission of the King of Yan, other vassal kings will not dare to take any action. In another year or two, when the Ministry of Revenue is abundant, we can implement the new army policies throughout the entire military. By then, the concerns of the powerful vassal kings will be resolved effortlessly. No need to exhaust the people, no need for military operations, and no damage to the bonds of the royal family. It will be a cause for celebration.”
Yu Xin and Zhang Dan nodded in agreement.
Although the Emperor managed to deceive everyone, there is still some understanding for his actions.
Zhu Di as the leader of the vassal kings and the commander in the north, with his vast military experience. Once the news of his self-binding in the capital is leaked, what might the people of Beiping Prefecture think?
They may not necessarily believe that Zhu Di bound himself to plead guilty. If someone takes advantage of the situation and stirs up trouble, spreading rumors that the court has captured Zhu Di and intends to forcefully reduce his power, won’t Beiping Prefecture fall into chaos?
Although Zhu Di has lost the Three Guards and his personal guards, he has been deeply rooted in Beiping for nearly twenty years, showing kindness to countless soldiers and civilians. Once those people hear about Zhu Di being captured, although they may not take up weapons to rebel, it will be difficult for them to accept. They will likely harbor resentment towards the court, and it may be unavoidable.
Temporarily blocking the news and taking control of public opinion will be more advantageous for the stability and unity of Beiping Prefecture.
“With the arrival of the King of Yan in the capital, it seems we are in for an interesting show,” Zhang Dan said with a faint smile, holding a memorial impeaching the King of Liao and King of Min.
Xie Jin shook his head with a hint of helplessness. Many people are currently impeaching the two kings, and now that Zhu Di has arrived, they may turn their focus on him, accusing him of “deceiving the sovereign and acting with malicious intent,” and the discourse of reducing the fiefdom may resurface once again.
King of Liao’s Mansion.
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng lay in their rattan chairs, basking in the warm spring sun. A stick of Ambergris incense burned nearby, enveloping them in its intoxicating fragrance as they blissfully indulged in the moment.
“I heard that Fourth Brother bound himself and came to the capital. It seems Zhu Neng and Zhang Yu also followed suit,” said Zhu Geng, his eyes closed but continuously moving beneath his eyelids.
Zhu Zhi took a deep breath, inhaling the fragrant scent, and contentedly said, “Bound himself? Hehe, let me tell you, Fourth Brother would only tie himself up with a rope once he reached the outskirts of the capital. His Majesty will handle this matter appropriately.”
Zhu Geng opened his eyes, sat up, and asked Zhu Zhi with seriousness, “Fifteenth Brother, are you prepared for that matter?”
Zhu Zhi rested his hands under his head, gazing at the blue sky and white clouds, and softly replied, “The Emperor requires us to perform a play, so let’s cooperate. Actually, it’s not a bad thing. At least we can enjoy some ease and comfort.”
Zhu Geng looked somewhat dejectedly at the incense burner beside him and sighed, “Ambergris is indeed a precious treasure, but it’s quite expensive.”
Zhu Zhi’s lips curled up slightly as he said, “Compared to what we are about to acquire, those things are insignificant.”
News of the imminent return of the King of Yan to the capital had reached the people of the capital.
However, the version among the people in the capital differs from the official court version regarding the self-binding and plea of guilt by the King of Yan. According to the civilian version:
Upon hearing that the King of Yan was unwell, the Emperor sent the Expositor in waiting, Yao Guangxiao, personally to Beiping Prefecture to visit him. Yao Guangxiao noticed the symptoms of the King of Yan and believed that only the imperial physicians in the capital could treat him. He then reported to the court, requesting permission to accompany the King of Yan to the capital.
Emperor Jianwen, concerned for the King of Yan’s well-being, ordered Yao Guangxiao to swiftly bring the King of Yan to the capital.
Some foolish individuals jumped to conclusions and claimed that the King of Yan had previously pretended to be insane to deceive the court and actually had ulterior motives. They speculated that now that he had been brought to the capital, he would likely face execution.
However, they were met with a barrage of criticism and scolding from a group of commoners and fled in embarrassment.
The King of Yan was truly ill. How could he have deceived the court or had ulterior motives?
There must be someone spreading false rumors.
In the Fengtian Hall, the fierce debate among officials showed no signs of stopping. Left Censor in chief of the Censorate, Jing Qing, passionately delivered his speech. However, he abruptly shifted his focus and turned his accusations toward the King of Liao and the King of Min, impeaching them for their lack of moral conduct, disrespect for ancestral traditions, involvement in commercial activities, and dishonoring the royal family.
Spittle flew as he emphasized one point: strict orders should be given to the two kings to present the methods for manufacturing medical gauze and alcohol. At same time they should be sent to the Imperial Clan Court and strictly monitored.
Hearing this, Xie Jin rolled his eyes.
The Imperial Clan Court is currently an empty shell. Those who can handle matters are all outside. Who will manage it?
Moreover, how can we, self-proclaimed upright gentlemen, engage in acts of forceful acquisition of others’ belongings? Isn’t it disgraceful?
He doesn’t even know how to conduct an impeachment. How on earth did Jing Qing become the Left Censor in chief of the Censorate?
After hearing this, Zhu Yunwen issued an order summoning the King of Liao and King of Min to the palace to explain clearly what exactly had happened.
As soon as the imperial order was issued, the King of Liao, Zhu Zhi, and the King of Min, Zhu Geng, dressed in their king’s attire, one carrying a basket and the other carrying a wooden box, entered the grand hall.
This made Jing Qing and others feel uneasy. It seemed like they had come prepared.
“We pay our respects to Your Majesty, long live Your Majesty!” Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng set down their belongings and paid their respects.
Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and said, “Rise. I have heard that both uncles, as kings, have shown disrespect for ancestral traditions and engaged in commercial activities. Is there any truth to this?”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng exchanged a glance and quickly exclaimed, “Your Majesty, we have been wronged!”
“How have you been wronged! You have been selling medical gauze and alcohol as merchants, openly charging one tael of silver per wooden box. Isn’t this the behavior of merchants, contradicting ancestral traditions?” Left Assistant Censor in chief of the Censorate, Zhou De, spoke up.
Zhu Zhi looked at Zhou De, gave a cold smile, and said, “May I ask, esteemed Censor, which eye of yours see me selling this medical gauze and alcohol?”
“The documents from the Ministry of War state it clearly, and Minister Ru has personally testified to it,” Zhou De shouted.
Ru Chang, furious with Zhou De, wished to strangle him. What does this have to do with me? It’s your petty squabble. Why involve me?
But since his name was mentioned, Ru Chang had no choice but to come forward and loudly say, “Your Majesty, I have no knowledge of whether the kings engage in commerce.”
Jing Qing widened his eyes, pointed at Ru Chang, and shouted, “Liar!”
Ru Chang snorted and said to Zhu Yunwen, “I heard that medical gauze and alcohol are beneficial for wound healing, so I visited the King’s Residence to request some. Unexpectedly, someone overheard and turned it into a story of the kings engaging in commerce.”
“Oh, is that so?” Zhu Yunwen’s lips curled into a smile as he scrutinized Ru Chang.
This fellow actually caught on and provided cover for the kings.
Ru Chang solemnly declared, “Every word is true.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and looked at Jing Qing, Zhou De, and others, saying, “If the Ministry of War visits for supplies, can it be considered engaging in commerce?”
“Well…” Jing Qing couldn’t believe it. Ru Chang was not standing on his side.
Without waiting for Jing Qing’s response, Zhu Yunwen stood up and solemnly said, “Even if the two kings engage in commerce and sell medical gauze and alcohol, how does it dishonor the royal family? What’s wrong with being a merchant? Are they inferior? Let me tell you, merchants are also citizens of Ming! They are also my citizens!”
“Is it possible that you official Jing Qing didn’t purchase wine, candles, and banquet provisions from merchants for your recent additional marriage? Hehe, all of you only care about your own pleasure. With plenty of land and wealth, you pretend to be righteous and have the audacity to accuse the two kings, who work day and night for the country and the people. I see that you have grown old!”

Chapter 66: Under the Pretext of Ancestral Tradition, disempowerment of King of Liao and King of Min
Old!
The two words were like a sharp sword, piercing Jing Qing’s heart!
Jing Qing felt a chill throughout his body, struggling to breathe. He anxiously looked at Zhu Yungui, his legs giving way as he knelt on the ground, trembling and unable to utter a word.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t look at Jing Qing but instead returned to the dragon throne. He asked Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng, “Uncle, although Minister Ru came to ask something, it cannot be considered a commercial act. However, I have heard that the Ministry of War intends to purchase a large amount of medical gauze and alcohol, and you two have negotiated the prices with them. This can be regarded as a commercial act. In Emperor Taizu’s ‘Imperial Ming Ancestral Instructions,’ clearly states that the imperial family and relatives are not allowed to engage in commerce. Do you two intend to violate ancestral tradition?”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng panicked upon hearing this and immediately knelt down.
Zhu Geng shouted, “Your Majesty, we do not have any intention to violate ancestral tradition. We merely wish to contribute to the prosperity of the Ming Dynasty and be a part of its glory.”
Zhu Zhi echoed, “As King of Min said, our loyalty is unquestionable. We are wholeheartedly devoted to the country. We implore Your Majesty to understand.”
Zhu Yunwen’s expression softened a bit, and he asked, “Rise and explain the situation clearly!”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng stood up.
Zhu Zhi cleared his throat softly and then said, “When I was stationed in Liaodong, I noticed that in our battles against the Tartars, three soldiers died and seven perished due to untreatable wounds and infections. So, I discussed it with King of Min, and we thought if we could find a method to reduce the soldiers’ wounds from festering and becoming inflamed, and saving their lives, it would be an achievement itself.”
Zhu Geng nodded vigorously and took over the conversation, saying, “Therefore, we diligently studied ancient texts day and night, sought out renowned physicians in the capital, exhausted all our efforts, and devoted our hearts and souls… um, we finally found a solution. We collaborated with the people in our residence, conducting extensive research, utilizing countless resources and funds, until we finally succeeded.”
Zhou De clenched his teeth and interjected, “Since you have succeeded, the two kings should present this method to the court instead of violating the regulations set by Emperor Taizu, conducting business and trade using the esteemed status of the vassal king!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Minister Zhou’s words are not without merit. How do you explain yourselves?”
Zhu Zhi sighed and walked over to a nearby basket covered with a white cloth. He lifted the cloth, reached inside the basket, and pulled out a cold steamed bun, causing a commotion in the court.
Xie Jin and others watched, uncertain about Zhu Zhi’s intentions.
Zhu Zhi held up the steamed bun and shouted to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, as a vassal king, I should be living a life of luxury and tranquility. But I couldn’t bear it. I wanted to do something for the country and the army. So, I invested all the resources of the king’s mansion, to the production of these medical gauzes and alcohol. Now, the people in the mansion can only eat a cold steamed bun each day!”
“In order to provide a hot and satisfying meal for everyone, in order to feed the hundreds of mouths behind me, I had no choice but to engage in commercial activities. Only by selling these medical gauzes and alcohol to the Ministry of War can the people in the mansion survive, and we can have some funds to support our families!”
Zhou De was filled with suspicion. You two always go to the Qingyan Tower, as if you’re living on cold steamed buns?
If that’s the case, I also want to eat a cold steamed bun.
“It has cost so much?”
Zhu Yunwen asked in surprise.
Zhu Zhi took a bite of the cold steamed bun, chewed it slowly, and with difficulty swallowed it down. Tears welled up in his eyes as he shouted unwillingly, “If not for this, who would be willing to embark on the path of commerce as a vassal king? If the court is willing to allocate the resources invested by the two mansions, I have no complaints or regrets. I will willingly present this method of manufacturing medical gauze and alcohol! But if they want to take away the method without providing funds, they are forcing the people of the King of Liao’s Mansion and King of Min’s Mansion to starve to death. I’m sorry, but I cannot agree!”
“I also refuse!” Zhu Geng shouted loudly.
Xie Jin rubbed his forehead. These two kings are quite good at acting. No wonder they have been inviting the art troupe to their residences these days. So, it turns out they entrusted the funds to the troupe.
Liu Jun, the Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, stood up and said to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, I believe the efforts and resources expended by the two kings in researching the medical gauzes and alcohol are beneficial to our military and civilians. The Ministry of War’s procurement, such as purchasing food and horses, is reasonable. On the contrary, it benefits the Ming Dynasty even more.”
Apologies for the confusion. Here’s the corrected version:
Zhou De couldn’t stand it anymore and retorted sharply, “What benefits are there? It’s just a waste of the national treasury!”
Liu Jun coldly glanced at Zhou De and ignored him. Holding his tablet, he said, “Your Majesty, the Ministry of War’s procurement serves three purposes: First, it fulfills the patriotic intentions of the two kings, creating a positive narrative. Second, it supports the expenses of the kings’ households, improving their livelihoods. Third, if the court forcefully demands the kings to present their techniques, will the court expect them to offer any future innovations? Or in other words, who would dare to invest the resources of the entire mansion to develop things that benefit the country?
Ru Chang stepped forward and said, “I believe Minister Liu’s words are correct. If we promote the culture of sharing methods, it might dampen the enthusiasm of the two kings. Moreover, even if we obtain their method, it would require manpower and resources to produce, which would still deplete the national treasury. It would be better to entrust this matter to the two kings, with the Ministry of War procuring it to uphold righteousness.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and looked at the Minister of Revenue, Huang Zicheng.
Huang Zicheng stepped forward and loudly proclaimed, “If it benefits the military and our soldiers, I will fully support it.”
“Your Majesty, this goes against ancestral tradition!”
Zhou De unwillingly exclaimed.
Jing Qing also stood up and shouted, “Your Majesty, engaging in commerce for personal gain will only lead to endless greed. If the kings participate in commerce, they will abuse their status and dominate the market, causing chaos and harming the livelihoods of the people!”
Secretary from the Grand Secretariat, Xie Jin, solemnly stepped forward.
Jing Qing, Zhou De, and others felt uneasy, unsure of what Xie Jin would say or which position he would take.
Among the three members of the Grand Secretariat, Xie Jin had an air of being the chief secretary. His words carried more weight than Yu Xin and Zhang Dan.
The court suddenly fell silent, with everyone eagerly waiting for Xie Jin to speak.
Xie Jin solemnly said, “I concur with the words of Left Censor in Chief Jing Qing and Left Assistant Censor Zhou De! With Emperor Taizu’s ancestral tradition in mind, allowing the vassal kings to engage in commerce is not beneficial in the long run. In my opinion, it is not advisable to let the two kings continue with their commercial activities.”
Ru Chang, Liu Jun, and others were shocked. How could this contradict their previous statements?
What was Xie Dashen up to?
Looking at Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, one had his eyes closed in meditation, while the other gazed up at the dragon pattern on the ceiling, as if that the affairs of the court are unrelated to the two.
Jing Qing and Zhou De were filled with excitement. The Grand Secretariat actually supported them!
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, a hint of an enigmatic smile in his eyes, and asked, “Oh, according to your words, what should we do then?”
Xie Jin looked at Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, and Zhu Geng, the King of Min, and said sternly, “Setting aside their initial intentions, let’s focus on the fact that the two kings profited from commerce, which goes against ancestral tradition. A decree should be issued to punish them! I propose disempowering the king of Liao and Min, in accordance with the law set by Emperor Taizu!”
“Disempower the kings?!”
The court erupted in commotion, with ministers engaging in discussions and pointing fingers.
Initially, it was Huang Zicheng, Qi Tai, and others who led the proposal to disempower the kings, but it was all done secretly, carefully discussed behind closed doors with the emperor, deciding who to target first and then the next.
There were also written requests for disempowerment, but those publicly advocating it in the court were still a minority.
Now, in the Feng Tian Hall, right in front of the vassal kings, there was only one person openly calling for their disempowerment — Xie Jin!
Fang Xiaoru’s mouth twitched slightly. This Xie Jin was truly audacious, taking it to this level! It reminded Fang Xiaoru of his conversation with Yang Shiqi:
“Merchants are good, what’s the bigger picture?”
“Merchants are good, it should actually be ‘being a merchant is good.’ His Majesty intends to use ancestral tradition as an excuse to disempower the kings.”

Chapter 67: Ministry of Revenue tax the Ministry of Revenue…
Zhu Yunwen, through a family banquet, changed the fiefdom of the King of Liao to Songjiang Prefecture and the fiefdom of the King of Min to Ningbo Prefecture. However, the two princes never actually went to govern their respective territories in Songjiang and Ningbo, so their actual presence remained in Guangning Prefecture and Yunnan Prefecture.
The dispute over land ownership in the court has reached its end. Some officials from the Censorate and the Ministry of Justice argue that if the imperial family also occupies land and does not address the land disputes within the imperial family, how can they set an example in resolving disputes among the gentry?
Then let’s have you see how the imperial family handles it!
Disempowering the kings and reclaiming their land holdings, including the land of tenant farmers and self-cultivating farmers, let’s see what you all have to say.
Xie Jin was well aware that Zhu Yunwen’s gaze had been fixed on the land, on the land disputes.
Since the Emperor intended to use the “King of Liao and King of Min” as sacrificial offerings and was preparing to make a move to warn those stubborn monkeys, as a loyal subject, the most appropriate thing to do was to hand the Emperor the sharpest knife.
Zhu Yunwen’s expression grew serious, and the noise in the court gradually subsided.
“I oppose!”
Ru Chang quickly stepped forward and exclaimed, “The medical gauze and alcohol researched by the King of Liao and King of Min have greatly benefited the soldiers and the state. It should not be excessively criticized in the name of ancestral tradition!”
“I concur with the opinion of Secretary Xie.” Yu Xin spoke up.
Zhang Dan followed suit and said, “I also concur with Secretary Xie’s opinion. Engaging in commerce with the status of vassal kings goes against ancestral tradition. Moreover, as vassal kings they have esteemed status, and merchants would definitely curry their favor, leading to corruption and greed. It would be difficult to avoid such negative influences. If the vassal kings amass great wealth, wouldn’t it harm the foundation of the country?”
Ru Chang grew anxious. What if these people are disempowered, wouldn’t they be concerned about the potential retaliation from the King of Liao and King of Min? If they choose better to die than life in disgrace, and refuse to cooperate, where will the Ministry of War find medical gauzes and alcohol?
They are now entering February, and it’s only five months away from autumn in July.
Not to mention the time needed for procurement, even transporting the supplies to the frontiers would take two to three months. At most, the Ministry of War and the frontiers would have two months left.
If, during the peak of the enemy’s strength, these medical gauzes and alcohol fail to reach the frontline, it would render this year’s procurement efforts practically worthless.
After all, the northern frontier is where the highest number of injuries and illnesses occur, and it’s the place that most desperately needs this batch of military supplies!
Ru Chang looked worried and shouted, “I believe that while ancestral tradition is important, the well-being of the nation, and the lives of soldiers, are also crucial! I earnestly request Your Majesty to show mercy to the two princes for the sake of the two million soldiers of Great Ming!”
Zhu Yunwen looked troubled as he gazed at the officials and sighed, “This matter is difficult to handle.”
Xie Jin smiled and said, “Your Majesty, I believe that while the King of Liao and King of Min have violated ancestral tradition, their title should be revoked but due to their contributions to the state, their titles, salaries, and allowances should remain unchanged, but their fiefdoms can be reclaimed as a form of punishment.”
The ministers couldn’t help but inhale sharply.
Jing Qing was particularly shocked. The usually amiable Xie Jin turned out to be an executioner. With a smile on his face, he was ready to wield the knife against the two kings. He spoke eloquently, mentioning the retention of their titles and unchanged allowances, but without their fiefdoms, could they still be called as vassal king?
A fiefdom is a territorial possession, a symbol of being a vassal state. If you take away their lands, these two kings would become nothing more than idle kings.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng and asked, “What do the two uncles have to say?”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng exchanged a glance. Zhu Zhi solemnly said, “Your Majesty, I and King of Min are willing to contribute to the soldiers of Great Ming. Currently, being in the capital, we are unable to manage the affairs of our fiefdoms. I am willing to surrender my fiefdom and ask for Your Majesty’s permission to engage in commerce for the nation.”
“I am also willing to surrender my fiefdom!”
Zhu Geng quickly added.
Zhu Yunwen calmly looked at the two kings and advised, “The fiefdoms were established by Emperor Taizu. How can I take them back…”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng shouted in unison, “Our minds are made up.”
Zhu Yunwen reluctantly nodded and said, “The King of Liao and King of Min wish to engage in commerce for the nation. Their loyalty is commendable. Although it goes against ancestral tradition, the surrendering of their fiefdoms offsets this. Since the two kings are determined to engage in commerce for the nation, I will set a precedent for you. I only hope that you remember your initial intentions and engage in commerce for the nation, not for personal gain!”
“Thank you for Your Majesty’s grace! We will never forget.”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng bowed down in gratitude.
Left Censor in Chief Jing Qing and the other ministers, hadn’t reacted yet. In just a few words, the fiefdoms of the King of Liao and King of Min were taken back? And they were even allowed to become imperial merchants?
Looking at Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng, they didn’t utter a word of complaint. So those over 20,000 acres of land aren’t their land?
Zhu Yunwen solemnly said, “Vassal kings engaging in commerce is a precedent in Great Ming. However, we cannot view this situation through ordinary commercial laws. Here’s the proposal: we will temporarily set the tax rate at 1/15, and the tax collected will supplement the national treasury. Furthermore, the medical gauze and alcohol will be used for military needs. I hope the two kings, along with the Ministry of War, Ministry of Revenue, and the Grand Secretariat, will renegotiate the prices, avoiding greed.”
Huang Zicheng, the Minister of Revenue, felt a twitch at the corner of his mouth. A 1/15 tax rate meant doubling the commercial tax. In theory, the Ministry of Revenue could collect more tax revenue, which should be a reason to be happy. However, the problem was that the Ministry of Revenue wasn’t only responsible for tax collection but also for the transactions…
The Ministry of Revenue would use the money to purchase goods from the two kings. On the surface, it appeared that the kings were paying taxes, but in reality, the tax burden would be distributed among the medical gauze and alcohol supplies. In the end, it would still be the Ministry of Revenue bearing the burden of the tax.
What kind of situation was this?
The Ministry of Revenue taxing itself?
“I humbly request, Your Majesty, to be present during the negotiation of this pricing.”
Huang Zicheng was worried that the two kings would raise prices recklessly. Moreover, the price of one tael of silver for a wooden box was already high. The Ministry of War wanted to make a large-scale purchase, but the Ministry of Revenue might not have enough funds to allocate.
The only viable solution was to negotiate the terms of the trade.
Zhu Yunwen nodded and agreed, “This matter is of great importance. In that case, I will personally be present for the negotiation. Let’s hold it in the Jinshen Hall.”
At this point, it was meaningless for court officials to impeach the two kings any further. They no longer wanted their fiefdoms. Now they only had a bare title of a vassal king. You couldn’t just take away their allowances as well. Besides, they had made contributions. Who knows, their households would also have a supply of medical gauze and alcohol in the future. After all, whose children hadn’t suffered from injuries?
The Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of War had no objections. Everyone respectfully bid farewell to the Emperor, chanting “Long live, long live!”
Jinshen Hall.
Grand Secretariat’s Xie Jin, Minister of Revenue Huang Zicheng, Minister of War Ru Chang, and Liu Jun, the four sat on the east side while Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng sat on the west. Zhu Yunwen sat to the north, sipping tea as he listened attentively.
Ru Chang frowned as he looked at the two kings pretending to be impoverished while holding their cold bun. He said, “Two kings, the purchase by the court has been settled, and the difficulties of the two mansions are no longer a problem. However, in terms of the pricing, please offer some concessions. One tael of silver for one wooden box is an exorbitant price and is not conducive to the purchase, nor can it benefit the entire army.”
Zhu Zhi took a bite of the bun, feeling the hardness, but still pretended to enjoy it. After washing it down with wine, he said, “official Ru, it’s not that we don’t want to lower the price. In the presence of His Majesty, I will be frank with everyone. The cost of producing one box is only seven maces of silver, with two maces of silver allocated for the daily needs of the two mansions. The profit is only one maces. Isn’t one tael already the minimum?”
“If one wooden box earns one mace of profit, then with one hundred thousand boxes, it’s ten thousand taels of profit. Isn’t that enough?” Liu Jun asked.
Zhu Zhi shook his head and sighed, “Leaving aside whether the Ministry of War wants to purchase one hundred thousand boxes, just in terms of production, with the current manpower of the two mansions, it would take one year. One year equals ten thousand taels. Split equally between me and Prince Min, it would be less than five hundred taels per person per month. That’s not enough to cover the cost of inviting a performance from the Art Troupe, let alone going to the Qingyan Tower. Vice Minister Liu, would you handle this business?”



---


Chapter 68: Group Purchasing, give me some discount…
In business, seeking profit is a common practice. It is reasonable to negotiate for favorable terms and seek the best possible outcome.
As Zhu Yunwen observed the back-and-forth exchange between the two sides, he couldn’t help but smile. Regardless of the outcome they would reach, the interests of the royal family were guaranteed.
The Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of War were clearly at a disadvantage in the argument against the two kings. This seemingly simple scenario actually involved numerous economic knowledge.
The issue of seller’s market versus buyer’s market is evident, and it is currently a seller’s market.
The Ministry of War and the Ministry of Revenue both recognize the benefits of medical gauze and alcohol and are aware of the high demand and limited supply. They are fully prepared to make the complete purchase. At this moment, the two kings have the upper hand and can set the price according to their preference, displaying strong bargaining power.
Another issue is the problem of information asymmetry.
As the sellers, the two kings state that the production cost is seven maces. However, the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of War, as the buyers, have no knowledge of the true cost and have not seriously considered what the actual cost might be. They simply think that the pricing, although high, seems reasonable.
In the future, businessmen used this approach to employ tactics like hunger marketing and false advertising, reportedly making a lot of money. Although Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng don’t know Adam Smith and haven’t read “The Wealth of Nations,” they understand a simple principle:
The goods are in my hands!
The price is under my control.
Seeing that the Ministry of Revenue and Ministry of War cannot convince the two kings any further, They are preparing to settle the transaction at nine maces per box. Xie Jin sets aside his teacup and looks at the two kings seriously, saying, “Seven maces, at most seven maces.”
Zhu Geng disagrees and says, “Secretary Xie, seven maces is only our cost. If it’s set at that price, how can the two mansions sustain themselves?”
Xie Jin shook his head and said, “The cost mentioned by King of Liao, maybe its true, but two kings also need to understand it cost seven maces to develop, once production is scaled up and daily output increases, the cost will be diluted. After six months, the cost may be as low as four or three maces. Ministry of Revenue purchasing at price of seven maces is already advantageous for the two kings.”
Zhu Geng looked at Zhu Zhi with some hesitation. After calculating for a while, Zhu Zhi said, “The minimum is eight mace.”
Xie Jin was about to argue further when Zhu Yunwen knocked on the table, and everyone’s gaze turned towards him.
“In my opinion, the medical gauze and alcohol can not only be used for soldiers but also be distributed to the Six Ministries and provincial governments. In other words, this procurement is a collective purchase by the court and involves a significant quantity. Why not offer some concessions?”
Zhu Zhi wore a pained expression and looked at Xie Jin before sighing, “Since His Majesty has spoken, I will step back. If the Ministry of Revenue is willing to sign a contract for two hundred thousand crates, then let it be at seven maces.”
Ru Chang, Huang Zicheng, and others were delighted. After discussing among themselves, they believed that procuring only two hundred thousand crates was insufficient. The Capital garrisons alone required at least fifty thousand crates to be kept in stock, and another hundred fifty thousand crates were needed to be transported to the border.
Moreover, these are consumable goods, not something that can be purchased today and be enough for the whole year. Once consumed, they need to be replenished. Two hundred thousand crates are far from enough.
“Here’s the proposal: the Ministry of War will procure three hundred thousand crates at seven mace per crate, with delivery in increments of ten thousand crates. Once the transaction of three hundred thousand crates is completed, subsequent procurements will be negotiated separately. Is that acceptable?” Ru Chang earnestly proposed.
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng nodded in agreement.
Under the witness of Zhu Yunwen, the two princes and the Ministry of War signed the procurement contract, with the Ministry of Revenue and the Grand Secretariat providing their signatures as guarantees.
Everyone was satisfied with this outcome.
After the departure of the two kings and others, Xie Jin and Zhu Yunwen discussed how to handle the issue of the land and estates of the two kings. Zhu Yunwen’s idea was simple: to divide the land and convert the tenant farmers of the kings’ estates into self-cultivating farmers. In the future, the tax would be collected based on the output of the land, following a Single Whip method.
Xie Jin agreed and then said, “Your Majesty, Single Whip method has encountered resistance in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region. Yan Qiliang has reported that the local gentry at the grassroots level are resisting and refusing to cooperate. They can’t even determine who owns the land, making it difficult to proceed with land measurement and they hope the court can make decisions.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the setting sun and said, “If no one claims ownership of the land, then it becomes ownerless land. Since it is ownerless land, let’s distribute it to those who have no land or limited land. Inform Yan Qiliang and the provincial administration offices in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region to issue notices to local administration offices, setting a deadline. If anyone fails to clarify or manage the land, from the lowest-ranking officials to the provincial administration commissioner, they will be stripped of their official positions and assigned to be responsible for land measurement.”
Xie Jin chuckled. With such high pressure, how could things not get done?
Those individuals had studied hard for decades, finally managed to climb up the ladder, and obtained official positions. If they were to be removed from office, it would be a great loss. Compared to the small benefits offered by the local gentry and aristocracy, preserving their official positions was the most important.
Xie Jin accompanied Zhu Yunwen as they walked in the palace, finalizing many matters in their conversation.
Zhu Yunwen admired Xie Jin greatly. Xie Jin was highly talented, capable of handling affairs with insight and foresight. He was an excellent candidate for the position of prime minister.
It’s no wonder that in history, Zhu Di exclaimed, “The world cannot be without me for a single day, and I cannot be without Xie Jin for a single day.”
Zhu Yunwen only used four words, “Ah, Merchants are good,” but Xie Jin understood his intentions completely. Step by step, they cooperated and ultimately took over the kings’ estates, granting the kings the status of imperial merchants and avoiding future criticism and accusations regarding their commercial activities.
“Your Majesty, how should we arrange the entry of the King of Yan into the capital?” Xie Jin inquired.
Zhu Yunwen pondered for a moment and replied, “The King of Yan is highly talented, and it concerns the future military system. We mustn’t neglect it. You shall go on my behalf and have Five Army Commandery nobles join to welcome Zhu Di into the city tomorrow at noon.”
Xie Jin bowed and said, “I will follow your orders.”
Seeing that it was already dusk, Zhu Yunwen told Xie Jin, “Prepare yourself early.”
Xie Jin performed a salute and left the palace.
Kunning Palace.
When Zhu Yunwen arrived, Ma Enhui greeted him with a gentle smile. Before she could pay her respects, Zhu Yunwen helped her up.
“The Empress is in a good mood?” Zhu Yunwen couldn’t help but smile when he saw Ma Enhui’s cheerful expression.
Ma Enhui pointed to the abacus by her side and said, “Your Majesty, I just calculated it. The military procurement by the Ministry of War amounts to thirty thousand crates, each priced at seven maces of silver. If we calculate it this way, we will receive two hundred and ten thousand taels of silver. I never imagined that such a small amount of gauze and alcohol could yield such profits.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui helplessly. It seemed that there were never any costs in her accounting books.
“Empress, out of the two hundred and ten thousand taels of silver, we need to pay fourteen thousand taels as taxes…”
“What? What is the Ministry of Revenue doing? They collect fourteen thousand taels of tax from two hundred and ten thousand taels? Isn’t it supposed to be a 1/30 tax rate according to our commercial laws, which means only seven thousand taels should be taken? Your Majesty, you need to intervene on my behalf!”
Ma Enhui felt wronged. Losing seven thousand taels of silver out of thin air, how could she not feel heartbroken?
Zhu Yunwen spread his hands, lacking confidence, and said, “Empress, it is I who implemented this policy…”
Ma Enhui widened her eyes, looking at Zhu Yunwen in disbelief. Zhu Yunwen nodded.
It’s over.
Sleeping in Kunning Palace is no longer an option.
Zhu Yunwen lamented silently. Capitalists are indeed not easy to deal with…
With nowhere else to go, Zhu Yunwen had a meal in the Imperial Kitchen. He chatted with the eunuchs and palace maids until midnight. It was only when a strong wind blew in the night that he made his way back to Kunning Palace.
Passing by Chengqian Palace, Zhu Yunwen paused.
Shuangxi saw Zhu Yunwen looking in the direction of Chengqian Palace and asked, “Your Majesty, are we heading to Chengqian Palace for the night?”
Narrowing his eyes, Zhu Yunwen asked, “I remember that Chengqian Palace operates day and night without stopping.”
Shuangxi smiled and nodded, saying, “Indeed, Lady Luo has divided the workers into three shifts for round-the-clock production.”
Zhu Yunwen frowned and pointed towards Chengqian Palace, saying, “Listen, besides the sound of the wind, there are no other noises.”
Shuangxi listened carefully and indeed heard no sounds of production.
“This is not good, something has happened!”
Zhu Yunwen suddenly felt uneasy and hurried towards Chengqian Palace.

Chapter 69: The Group Poisoning Incident at Chengqian Palace
The gates of Chengqian Palace were slightly ajar. Zhu Yunwen pushed open the doors and looked towards the palace.
The doors to the main hall were tightly shut, the windows closed, and the lights were on inside, but there was no sound of weaving.
The cold wind howled, causing Zhu Yunwen to wrap his robe tightly around him.
He hurriedly ran towards the entrance, pushed open the doors, and was greeted by the smell of coal smoke. Looking inside, he saw rows of neatly arranged looms, with palace maids either lying on the light gauze or collapsed on the ground.
“Your Majesty, What… what has happened?”
Shuangxi and the others rushed over and were astonished by the scene before them.
“Luo Yan’er!”
Zhu Yunwen walked through the looms and approached the table. Luo Yan’er was seated in a chair, her delicate body leaning unnaturally to one side. If it weren’t for the support of the chair, she might have already collapsed to the ground.
“Hold your breath and open all the doors and windows, quickly!” Zhu Yunwen ordered sternly. He then lifted Luo Yan’er in his arms and walked towards the exit.
Shuangxi and the others opened all the doors and windows as instructed.
The howling wind from the north swept into the palace, causing the dozens of braziers on the ground to flicker with fire as the wind blew through the pale gray coals.
“Carry everyone out and place them near the air vents! Shuangxi, immediately inform the Empress, consort Ning, and Consort Xian, to bring people to the Chengqian Palace. Summon the physicians from the Imperial Academy of Medicine, it must be quick,” Zhu Yunwen commanded.
He gently placed Luo Yan’er on the ground and then took off his own outer garment, covering her with it. He reached out to sense her breathing, relieved that she had not lost her ability to breathe.
As the palace maids and eunuchs busily carried the affected individuals out and dispersed them in the courtyard.
Ma Enhui, who had been asleep, was awakened by the news of the incident. She quickly got up and led her attendants to the scene, followed by Consort Ning and Consort Xian.
“What has happened, Your Majesty?” Ma Enhui asked with concern as she looked at the palace maids in the Chengqian Palace. Some of them had regained consciousness but were weak, struggling to breathe. Others were experiencing discomfort and vomiting uncontrollably.
What’s even more serious is that some of the palace maids have yet to regain consciousness. Even when gently called upon, they can only respond with a vague barely, unable to open their eyes.
Zhu Yunwen ordered for Luo Yan’er to be carried to the Jingren Palace for recuperation. Then, he explained to Ma Enhui and the others, “It’s carbon monoxide poisoning. Tonight, the temperature dropped, and with the strong wind, many braziers were added in the Chengqian Palace. The smoke became too heavy, combined with the tightly sealed rooms and the large number of people present, preventing the smoke from dissipating and resulting in poisoning.”
As for the issue of carbon monoxide, Zhu Yunwen couldn’t explain much further. Many people believe that people in ancient times were unaware of carbon monoxide poisoning, but that is not the case. Yes, ancient people didn’t write the chemical formula CO, but they were aware of the concept of carbon monoxide poisoning.
In “Record of washed grievances” by Song Ci of the Southern Song Dynasty, carbon monoxide poisoning is clearly documented:
“When exposed to coal poisoning, if the air in the earthen pit is leaking and foul, and people are exposed to the fumes, they will unconsciously perish. Their bodies are limp and without injuries, similar to those who experience nightmares during sleep and cannot wake up.”
Ma Enhui looked at the palace maids lying all around, filled with distress, and urged, “Where are the imperial physicians? Why haven’t they arrived?”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head, letting out a sigh of lament.
Imperial physicians?
Even if the imperial physicians were to come, they probably wouldn’t have any effective solutions. In this world, there is no pure oxygen available for inhalation, which means there is no way to improve blood oxygen levels. He himself also lacked the means to administer intravenous glucose solution. What could he use to save them?
But wait, although there is no glucose solution, there should still be some sweetened water available!
Although sweetened water may not have a significant effect on carbon monoxide poisoning, at the very least, it can moisten the throat and lungs. It is said to improve the oxygen-deprived environment in the brain, but he is not sure if that’s true.
Regardless, drinking sweetened water won’t kill anyone.
“Shuangxi, immediately instruct the Imperial Kitchen to prepare a pot of sweetened water using my refined sugar. It must be done quickly. Bring it all over here,” Zhu Yunwen commanded hastily.
Ma Enhui leaned down and looked at a pale-faced palace maid who had vomited several times, her eyes filled with tears.
Zhu Yunwen approached and softly said, “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. You’ll recover in a few days.”
The Administrator from the Imperial Academy of Medicine, Dai Yuanli, rushed over, gasping for breath. Zhu Yunwen quickly stepped forward and glared at Shuangxi, rebuking, “Dai Yuanli is already in his twilight years. How could you not have someone carry him into the palace? If you exhaust his body, how will you handle the consequences?”
Shuangxi and the others quickly knelt down, begging for forgiveness.
Dai Yuanli scratched his beard, composed himself, and said to Zhu Yunwen, “Thank you, Your Majesty, for your concern. I am not inconvenienced. Allow me to start the treatment first.”
Dai Yuanli can be considered a divine physician of the Ming Dynasty, known for his ability to cure ailments.
Prior to Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang’s passing, he intended to hold all the medical officials in the Imperial Medical Bureau accountable for their ineffective treatments, but he exempted Dai Yuanli and even expressed his “appreciation.”
Zhu Yunwen was curious whether traditional Chinese medicine could treat carbon monoxide poisoning.
Dai Yuanli examined several palace maids without saying much. He then proceeded to check the unconscious maids. He retrieved silver needles from his medicine box, heated them over a candle flame, and inserted one into the temple of a maid, and another into the philtrum.
With a few needle insertions, the maid gradually regained consciousness, her gaze unfocused, and she began experiencing symptoms of nausea.
“It is carbon monoxide poisoning. Please arrange for the Imperial Kitchen to extract juice from white radishes and distribute it to everyone. It can alleviate the symptoms. They should rest for a few days, and there should be no major issues,” Dai Yuanli said with ease.
“White radishes?” Zhu Yunwen furrowed his brow. It was certainly a novel remedy.
Each profession has its own specialization, and as a medical ignoramus, it would be best for him not to meddle in affairs he knew little about.
“Your Majesty, lady Luo has awakened,” Consort Xian hurriedly reported as she approached. Upon seeing Dai Yuanli, she quickly added, “Administrator Dai, please come to Jingren Palace to check on Lady Luo.”
Dai Yuanli, seeing that the individuals in Chengqian Palace were not seriously affected, readily agreed.
Luo yan’er’s face was pale, occasionally clutching her chest, experiencing waves of headaches and feeling nauseous. She desperately wanted to vomit but couldn’t. As she was suffering, she saw Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui approaching. She wanted to get up and greet them but was quickly stopped by Ma Enhui.
“Stay seated for now, Administrator Dai…”
Ma Enhui reassured Luoyan’er while looking at Dai Yuanli.
Dai Yuanli reached out his hand, sensing Luo yan’er’s pulse, then withdrew his hand and stood up to address Zhu Yunwen, saying, “Lady Luo pulse indicates weakness in the three pulse positions, suggesting a deficiency in both Qi and Blood. Combined with the coal poisoning, her body has become even weaker. She should rest and focus on self-care, avoiding further exhaustion. I will prescribe a medication to be taken for about a month, which should lead to improvement.”
“Thank you for your assistance Administrator Dai. Shuangxi, provide a sedan chair to escort the doctor. Make sure not to delay!” Zhu Yunwen instructed.
Shuangxi quickly agreed, Dai Yuanli tried to decline but couldn’t, so he reluctantly agreed and left the palace.
Luo yan’er weakly looked at Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui, apologizing, “Your Majesty, I have failed to manage the affairs of Chengqian Palace properly, and everyone has been poisoned by the coal. It has also delayed the production of medical gauze…”
Ma Enhui frowned, expressing some anger as she said, “A few days’ delay in production is nothing compared to your well-being and the well-being of others. In fact, you should thank His Majesty. If it weren’t for His Majesty going to Chengqian Palace during the night and staying until dawn, we cannot imagine the consequences.”
“Luo Yan’er on behalf of entire Chengqian Palace, express gratitude to His Majesty for saving our lives,” Luoyan’er struggled to perform a bow.
“Don’t blame yourself. It’s not your fault. Take good care of yourself, as we still need you to manage Chengqian Palace,” Zhu Yunwen comforted her.
He left Consort Xian to attend to Luo yan’er and went with Ma Enhui to Chengqian Palace. By this time, the palace maids had been evacuated. Looking at the still-burning braziers in Chengqian Palace, Zhu Yunwen fell into deep thought.
Braziers, hearths, coal stoves…
Zhu Yunwen sat down, warming his hands with the remaining fire in the brazier, and gently spoke to Ma Enhui beside him, “Empress, do you know? This incident of poisoning will change the fate of the Ming Dynasty.”

Chapter 70: The difference between courtiers and unruly women on the street.
Coal is a good thing.
In the “Classic of Mountains and Seas”, it is recorded: “On the mountain of Nü Chuang, there is much scalet copper on its south side, and much alunite on its north side”; “At the head of the Min Mountains, there is a mountain called Nü Ji, where there is abundant Alunite”; “Further east by 150 li, there is a mountain called Fengyu, where there is much white gold on its upper part and much alunite on its lower part.”
The term “Alunite” mentioned here refers to coal.
During the Wei and Jin periods, the name “Alunite” gradually changed to “Graphite”. In the Tang and Song periods, it was also called “Coal(石炭)” or “Coal(煤炭). During the Ming Dynasty, it was mainly referred to as “Coal(煤炭)”
As early as the Tang Dynasty, coal-coking technology emerged.
By the Song Dynasty, coal-coking technology had become more mature.
In the Northern Song Dynasty, there were dedicated “coal yards” and “official coal sales”. Coal seams were referred to as “coal veins”. Coal mining had become a major industry, gradually replacing firewood and becoming an important fuel for ordinary households.
The statement “Millions of households rely on coal and none on firewood” may be an exaggeration commonly used by literati, but it does reflect the abundance of coal in the capital city of Bianjing during the Northern Song Dynasty.
According to the “Annals of Yuan Dynasty”: “Coal is produced in Dagu Mountain, 15 mile west of Wanping County, with more than 30 black coal mines. There are also more than 10 white coal mines in 50-mile southwest of Peach Blossom Valley.”
To manage the buying and selling of coal, the Yuan Dynasty established a dedicated coal market in Yuan’s Capital Dadu.
In the Ming Dynasty, with the increase in population, the reduction of forests, and a certain degree of urbanization, people wanted to have hot meals and take hot baths. It was not feasible for everyone to go to Purple Mountain every day to chop firewood. Therefore, coal became the main fuel for the livelihood of the capital city.
The palace and various government bureaus also had significant coal consumption, especially during winter. Although the climate in the capital city was not as harsh as in the northern regions, winters in Nanjing were still difficult to bear.
Coal was also needed for heating in the palace. Although the Ming Dynasty did not consider palace maids and eunuchs as human beings, but in order to make people work, they should not freeze to death.
For example, the Palace Laundry Service required 40,000 catties of firewood, charcoal, and coal. the Directorate of Imperial Accouterments required 200,000 catties of firewood, charcoal, and coal; and the Palace Armament Bureau required nearly 1,000,000 catties of coal, lime, and water for firearms production last year.
The use of coal in the palace was a common occurrence, and incidents of poisoning were not unheard of. However, an incident of group poisoning of this scale was unprecedented.
This is not surprising considering that in the daily operations of the various palace bureaus, work was primarily done during the day, and they rested at night. During the day, with people coming and going, there were individuals responsible for managing the fire pots and charcoal stoves, and with fewer people, there were generally no major issues. At night, the number of lit coals was also limited, and the living conditions in the dormitories for palace maids and eunuchs were not ideal, with drafts and poor insulation.
The sleeping quarters of the empress and concubines were spacious enough and not afraid of small braziers and stoves.
But it was different in the Chengqian Palace.
It had become the center for producing medical gauze, and even at night, there were over a hundred people weaving. With the cold weather and closed doors and windows, along with the addition of many braziers for warmth, it led to the poisoning accident.
Zhu Yunwen was clear about the cause of the accident and thought of a solution.
However, it would take time.
After dealing with matters in the Chengqian Palace, Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui returned to the Kunning Palace. They only rested for two hour before it was already daylight.
Ma Enhui helped Zhu Yunwen put on his court attire and frowned, advising, “Your Majesty, you didn’t get enough rest last night. How about taking a day off from the court and focus on taking care of your health?”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and sighed, “As long as the land dispute issue is unresolved, I cannot take a day off from the court. Empress, please visit Lady Luo on my behalf, and instruct the Directorate of Palace delicacies to prepare for the evening banquet. When the King of Yan and his consort arrive, we will hold a family banquet in the Kunning Palace to entertain them.”
Ma Enhui nodded in agreement.
A real court assembly was not like what was depicted in modern TV dramas, with everyone orderly and each person taking turns to speak while others listened attentively, giving their agreement or opposition.
After the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries officials reported their respective matters, it was a time for free discussion. Some officials stood with hands on hips and noses in the air, while others tilted their official hats and rolled up their sleeves, appearing like street ruffians and troublemakers.
Scholars should maintain some elegance, not imitate military officers who would easily blurt out phrases like “your mother’s this and that.” Instead, they should ask with a concerned expression, “Your father is old and toothless, his words are muddled. Brother, why is your speech also unclear, unable to explain the origin of the land clearly?”
Well, scholars had a way with words.
With just one sentence, they not only inquired about the other person’s father but also insulted their unclear background. If your father was already eighty and you were only forty, it meant you were either a late-born child or had a connection with the neighbors. Like the origin of the land, it was unclear and unknown.
Without a solid foundation, one might think the other person was expressing concern, thank them with a smile, and then find out that their ancestors’ graves had been insulted.
But the court officials were not like rowdy market women.
When market women quarreled, they could freely use all sorts of insults and could go as far as their imaginations allowed. There were no rules or limits. After hours of cursing, they would remember that it all started because the other person glanced at them in the crowd.
Greeting among court officials had a higher level of difficulty.
No matter what, it couldn’t be separated from the issue at hand. If you greeted someone’s uncle, it had to be related to the land. Private matters were not allowed.
In summary, they had clear viewpoints and a clear theme.
Jing Qing of the Censorate and his colleagues advocated for the freedom of land transactions, known as “not disturbing the common people, relying on contractual and customary laws.” Huang Zicheng of the Ministry of Revenue led a group of people who supported the inspection of land transactions to “curb the trend of entrusting the land and protect the court’s tax revenue.”
Unlike the previous debates, the top officials of the Six Ministries finally expressed their stance after remaining silent for a few days. The Ministers of the Ministry of Personnel Qi Tai, the Ministry of Works Zheng Ci, the Ministry of Justice Bao Zhao, the Ministry of Personnel Chen Di, and the Ministry of War Ru Chang, all supported Huang Zicheng of the Ministry of Revenue.
With the top officials revealing their positions, officials who had been observing the court situation began to take sides.
As officials, those with a solid foundation would stand and speak wherever their roots were. Those without a foundation would naturally go wherever the wind blew.
Although no definitive conclusions were reached during the morning court, the overall situation had been determined, and the direction of the court gradually became clear.
After the morning court, some officials began writing letters to be sent back to their hometowns, instructing their families to take possession of the land they had seized and finding ways to silence any objections. If they couldn’t stop the objections, they would hand over land deeds and let others cultivate the land themselves.
Once the court was determined to rectify the land disputes, it was possible to establish a few exemplars. No one wanted to become a “symbolic figure” representing land disputes. It was better to resolve the matter as soon as possible.
Three Mountain Gate Dock.
Xie Jin, Ru Chang, Xu Huizu, and other prestigious figures from the Five Army Commandery stood at the dock, preparing to welcome the fleet escorting Zhu Di back to the capital. The one in command of the fleet was Zheng He, the Vice Commander of the Navy.
The flags fluttered on the warships.
Zheng He looked at the news that had arrived from the capital and turned to enter the cabin, reporting to Zhu Di and Yao Guangxiao, “The fleet is about to arrive at Three Mountain Gate Dock. There’s news from the palace that His Majesty and the Empress are holding a banquet in the Kunning Palace to entertain the King of Yan and his consort.”
Zhu Di raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised.
Yao Guangxiao smiled and said, “Very well.”
The Kunning Palace was part of the inner palace, and the banquet there was not a court banquet but a family gathering.
Entertaining the King of Yan and his consort with a family banquet indicated that Zhu Yunwen did not want to assert dominance over Zhu Di as ruler and subject, but rather to reunite as family members and nephews, catching up on old times.
From this arrangement, it could be seen that Zhu Yunwen trusted and respected Zhu Di.
“Your highness, let’s get ready to enter the capital.”
Yao Guangxiao stood up and made the suggestion.
Zhu Di laughed heartily and got up, walking into the adjacent room.
Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, and Qiu Fu also stood up and paid their respects as Zhu Di entered.
Zhu Di looked at the three old generals who had been with him for many years, his expression solemn as he said in a deep voice, “We have arrived in the capital. Let us go together to beg His Majesty for forgiveness.”

Chapter 71: The Political Show of Actor Zhu Di
Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, Ru Chang and other officials stood at the dock, watching as Zhu Di and others approached, completely disoriented in the river breeze.
They saw Zhu Di bare-chested, wearing thorny branches, striding confidently forward, followed by Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, and Qiu Fu, all with spines on their backs, bearing the weight as they walked.
Xie Jin furrowed his brow and looked at Xu Huizu.
Xu Huizu sighed and remained silent.
His brother-in-law was really skilled at acting, wasn’t he?
Last time in the court, he stood without bowing, displaying arrogance and disrespect. But once outside the palace, he became a humble person, treating everyone with great courtesy.
The performance was so remarkable that it left Xu Huizu in awe.
After returning to Beiping, Zhu Di either employed a strategy to resist the New Army policy or secretly established a breeding farm as a diversion. Finally, he even resorted to pretending to be insane and foolish, deceiving people throughout the country.
One would have thought that this was the pinnacle of Zhu Di’s acting skills, but what Xu Huizu did not expect was that upon Zhu Di’s return to the capital, he staged a “carrying thorn and apologize” act.
You are the King of Yan, not Lian Po[1]Lian Po (Chinese: 廉頗; c. 327 BC – 229 BC), was a prominent General of the Zhao state in the Warring States period of Chinese history. He is … Continue reading, and Zhu Yunwen is not Lin Xiangru[2]Lin Xiangru (Chinese: 藺相如; pinyin: Lìn Xiāngrú) (died c.July 260 BCE[1]) was a politician and general of the Warring States period, who served the state of … Continue reading either!
The conflict between you and your nephew is not a disagreement in political views driven by arrogance and prejudice, but rather a deadly conspiracy.
Who is this performance for?
“We greet Your Highness.”
Xu Huizu, Xie Jin, and others dared not neglect the etiquette and stepped forward to bow.
Zhu Di stopped in his tracks, looked at Xu Huizu and the others, and solemnly said, “I am guilty. This time, I have come to the capital to apologize to the Emperor. I am not worthy of your reception.”
Seeing Zhu Di’s demeanor, Xu Huizu realized that he was planning to carry thorn and apologize in the capital. If that were the case, wouldn’t the entire city be in an uproar?
“What crime does Your Highness have? Why should you carry thorns and walk? You might as well take the carriage and enter the imperial palace early,” Xu Huizu hurriedly advised.
Zhu Di waved his hand and said, “Duke of Wei, I harbor dissatisfaction, slander the court, deceive the emperor, and have disloyal thoughts. Fortunately, thanks to the emperor’s grace, I have awakened and now I must carry thorns and apologize to seek forgiveness.”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Di, who persisted in his decision, with deep concern and quickly signaled Xie Jin to say something.
Xie Jin smiled faintly and leisurely said, “If Your Highness enters the capital in this manner, it may damage the reputation of the King of Yan and lose the support of the people in the capital.”
Zhu Di looked at Xie Jin, frowned, and remained silent.
Xie Jin explained, “The people of the capital are well aware that the King of Yan is unwell, and the emperor has specially sent Scholar Yao to Beiping to invite your highness to the capital for recuperation. The close relationship between the royal family has already spread throughout the capital. Now, the common people are only hoping for your speedy recovery. If the your highness enters the city in such a way, how would the people feel…”
When setting up a stage and performing a play, what matters is the popularity.
If the play attracts criticism, then no one would be willing to perform it.
Xie Jin understood Zhu Di. He loved acting, and he had acting skills, but all his performances were for one purpose: to establish his authority, righteousness, benevolence, and courtesy in order to gain a great deal of support.
If it became widely known in the capital that Zhu Di came to apologize, then Zhu Di carrying thorns into the city would not only provoke criticism from some people, but it would also serve as a vivid example of his contributions to the state!
After all, the hearts of the common people are soft and easily swayed and persuaded.
At that time, with the sympathy of the people, everyone would look back at Zhu Di’s glorious achievements as a warrior and consider the hardships he endured for the country. Even if he made some mistakes, they could be forgiven.
If the emperor were to severely punish the King of Yan, it would undoubtedly affect the impression of the king among the masses and might even lead to criticism.
However, the current situation in the capital is different from Zhu Di’s expectations.
No one blames Zhu Di, and no one knows that Zhu Di came to apologize. Everyone thinks that Zhu Di is mentally ill due to poor health, and the emperor specifically brought him to the capital for treatment.
In this situation, if Zhu Di enters the city in good health, walking normally, and carrying thorns, it would be impossible to remove the hat of deceiving the emperor and the world under the guise of madness.
The hearts of the people will naturally lean towards the court. Even if Zhu Yunwen demotes Zhu Di to a commoner, it is unlikely that anyone would speak up for him.
Zhu Di felt trapped. He had prepared this play meticulously for nearly a month, and now he was being forced to cut it off with his own hands. Could he not feel frustrated?
Yao Guangxiao saw that the timing was right and spoke, “Your Highness, your health has not yet recovered. It is better to take the carriage and enter the imperial palace early.”
“Indeed,” Xu Huizu and others agreed.
With an escape route provided, Zhu Di took off the thorns on his back, and his back was already covered in blood and flesh.
Ru Chang saw that the attendants of the King of Yan wanted to deal with it hastily and quickly stopped them. He ordered someone to fetch medical gauze and alcohol, and after cleaning the wound, she applied alcohol and then wrapped it with medical gauze.
Zhu Di took a deep breath as the alcohol penetrated the wound. The pain was extraordinary.
“What is this?” Zhu Di pointed to a wooden box nearby and asked.
Ru Chou smiled and replied, “Your Highness, you may not know, but this is a crucial tool in the military. It will be necessary for military supplies in the future. It has the effect of accelerating wound healing and preventing inflammation and suppuration.”
“Oh? It’s so amazing?” As a commander, Zhu Di naturally understood how soldiers in the camp died. Most of them died because of improper wound treatment, resulting in either disability or death.
If such a good thing really existed, it would greatly ensure the combat effectiveness of the Ming army!
Xu Huizu concurred, “Your Highness, this item is indeed remarkable. It has already been initially equipped in the Capital garrison. However, the current production is still limited, and it cannot be delivered to the frontline. In about a month, after the production of King of Liao and King of Min catches up, the Five Army Commandery plans to transport ten thousand wooden boxes to the Beiping Garrison.”
Zhu Di was studying the medical gauze intently when he suddenly heard the names King of Liao and King of Min. He couldn’t help but ask, “King of Liao and King of Min? What is their relationship with this matter?”
“Your Highness, these medical gauze and alcohol were developed by the two Kings, King of Liao and King of Min, and sold to the Ministry of War,” Xu Huizu explained.
Zhu Di was completely confused. Leaving aside whether King of Liao and King of Min had the ability to develop and weave this medical gauze, even if they were engaged in business, it went against the ancestral rules. How could it be allowed?
Xie Jin, seeing that everything was ready, reached out and said, “The capital has undergone many changes. You will know in the future. Please, Your Highness and Consort, enter the carriage.”
Zhu Di nodded in agreement and, together with his Consort Xu Yihua, entered the carriage. Under the escort of the crowd, they entered the capital.
A crowd of onlookers surrounded them, all sending prayers.
On that day, Linggu Temple and Tianjie Temple in Nanjing were overcrowded, all praying for the well-being of the King of Yan.
Kunning Palace.
Zhu Di and Xu Yihua arrived together but did not enter the main gate of Kunning Palace. Instead, they knelt outside the palace.
The eunuch quickly informed Zhu Yunwen of the situation.
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly. It seemed that Zhu Di still had some sense of propriety. It was unnecessary to apologize outside; however, once inside the palace, he still needed to apologize before having a meal.
After leaving the palace gate, Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui approached and helped Zhu Di and Xu Yihua to their feet.
Just as Zhu Di stood up, he knelt down again and shouted, “I, Zhu Di, have deceived the emperor and acted disloyally. I have schemed against the New Army policy and committed treachery! I deserve to be executed! Your Majesty, please grant me death!”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di kneeling on the ground and Xu Yihua kneeling beside him and said, “Of course, we need to hold you accountable, but let’s have fourth uncle sit first and self-punish with three cups of wine. After that, we can discuss our merits and faults. How about that?”
Zhu Di looked up at Zhu Yunwen. He saw the profound and determined gaze in Zhu Yunwen’s eyes, and the smile at the corner of his mouth was both confident and gentle.
For a moment, Zhu Di couldn’t help but call out, “Your Majesty!”



---


Chapter 72: I have finished speaking, it’s your turn
Jie Jin, Xu Huizu, and Ru Chang stood on a high point, gazing into the distance, their hearts filled with passion as the lights of the capital began to shine.
Ru Chang smiled at the sky and exclaimed, “To revive the glory of the Han and Tang dynasties, wouldn’t it be lacking some brilliance without our names? We have lived for a hundred years and should strive for immortal accomplishments!”
Xu Huizu stood with great dignity, his gaze piercing, and said in a deep voice, “We should dedicate ourselves to the beauty of the mountains and rivers, with hearts filled with fervor!”
Xie Jin looked at the impassioned Ru Chang and Xu Huizu and nodded silently.
The current emperor is wise, benevolent, and ambitious. He possesses extraordinary strategies to secure the border and implements new policies to improve the lives of the people. Moreover, he listens to the opinions of others, accepting reasonable ones and rejecting unreasonable ones.
An enlightened ruler is the foundation of a prosperous era!
This is the best era since the founding of the Ming Dynasty, free from the slaughter of bloody conflicts and the life-or-death struggles of wars. The realm is stable, and the hearts of the people are in harmony. It is a time for literary and military talents to display their abilities and achieve great deeds!
The literati pursue their desired glorious era, showcasing their patriotism and leaving their names in history.
The generals forge the iron army of the Ming Dynasty, training soldiers and horses rigorously, and expanding our territory!
Xie Jin clenched his fist tightly, gazing at the distant lights, and proudly declared, “I desire to borrow thirty thousand measures of clear winds and stars, following the heavens to the highest sky. Unafraid of the cold winds and clouds obstructing, leaving my name in history for a thousand autumns.”
In that moment, a brisk wind blew, and the three of them exchanged heartfelt words, singing a resounding song as they disappeared into the distance.
In Kunning Palace, a family feast was in full swing.
Zhu Di self-punished with three cups of wine, took a sip, and felt the warm strength of the alcohol inside him. He couldn’t help but praise, “Your Majesty, this wine is extraordinary!”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily, gestured for Ma Enhui to pour more wine, and said, “Fourth Uncle like wine. Tomorrow, I’ll have someone send some to the King of Yan’s residence. Just be careful, Fourth Uncle.”
“Oh? Why should I be careful?” Zhu Di asked in confusion.
Ma Enhui, holding the wine jug, burst into laughter and said, “Uncle King of Yan, this wine is extremely potent. It brings immediate delight when consumed, but the next day, it will cause a splitting headache. Last time, His Majesty had quite a hard time and only recovered after half a day.”
Xu Yihua stood up, wanting to take the wine jug from Ma Enhui’s hand but was politely declined with a smile.
Ma Enhui personally poured wine for Zhu Di, who quickly expressed his gratitude.
Both Zhu Di and Xu Yihua could sense the special nature of today’s family feast. There were no palace maids or eunuchs attending, only Ma Enhui personally managing everything. Even the dishes from the Imperial Kitchen were delivered personally by Ma Enhui, who went to the door to receive them.
Here, there are no outsiders.
Zhu Di raised his wine cup and said with some emotion, “Your Majesty, I am guilty, and I should be punished with another cup…”
Zhu Yunwen frowned as he watched Zhu Di drinking cup after cup and said, “Fourth Uncle, are you using the pretext of self-punishment to indulge in excessive drinking?”
Upon hearing this, Ma Enhui and Xu Yihua burst into laughter.
Ma Enhui took the opportunity to introduce, “Don’t just focus on drinking, King of Yan and Consort Xu. This dish was personally prepared by His Majesty in the Imperial Kitchen. You must try it.”
“What?”
Zhu Di and Xu Yihua exchanged surprised glances.
The emperor cooking, and the empress adding wine—such an honor was unparalleled in the Ming Dynasty.
“I am unworthy of such an honor,” Zhu Di said humbly.
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and, after taking a bite of the dish, said, “Actually, I understand. If my father were still alive, you would be content to be a vassal king. But Father… sigh, Emperor Taizu passed the throne to me across a generation, and you, Fourth uncle, are in the prime of your life with remarkable achievements. It’s natural to feel dissatisfied, and I can understand that.”
Upon hearing this, Zhu Di broke out in a cold sweat.
Seeing Zhu Di’s uneasiness, Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “Fourth uncle, there are no other people here. We can speak openly without seeking blame, just share our thoughts. Since I ascended the throne, although I hold the empire in my hands, I have trouble sleeping day and night.”
“You uncles hold great military power, stationed at the border. If you ever have the slightest disloyalty, you can march a thousand miles south and drive me off the throne. After all, I am not Emperor Taizu. I lack expertise in military affairs and talents. If uncles were to lead your troops south, my abdication would be minor compared to the chaos and disintegration of the Ming Dynasty.”
“Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng have seen the drawbacks and repeatedly advised me to gradually reduce the power of the vassal kings. I won’t hide it from you, Fourth uncle, I have considered reducing the power of the vassal kings. Heh, reducing the power of the kings. The most challenging one is still you, Fourth uncle.”
Zhu Di, Xu Yihua, and Ma Enhui listened quietly to Zhu Yunwen’s words, causing waves of emotions to surge within Zhu Di’s heart.
Zhu Yunwen took a sip of wine and continued, “After I fell in Xiaoling, I had a deep realization. Although reducing the power of the vassal kings seemed feasible, it would be detrimental to both the family and the nation. For the family, Fourth uncle is the leader of the vassal kings, highly regarded by Emperor Taizu, and holds a distinguished position. For the nation, you are the commander of the northern forces, fighting for the country, and your achievements contribute to the stability of the state..”
“How could I, out of my own concerns, take actions that would harm the royal family, and the nation, and lose the trust of the people? Therefore, I firmly believe that even if fourth uncle, has any misgivings, I must bring you back. I am willing to endure for the sake of the Ming Dynasty, so shouldn’t fourth uncle, also contribute to the prosperity of the Ming Dynasty?”
Upon hearing this, Zhu Di couldn’t help but choke up. The Emperor’s magnanimity was overwhelming, and as his subject, Zhu Di had repeatedly gone against his wishes. Even though Zhu Yunwen had admonished him time and time again, Zhu Di had continued his relentless pursuit in the darkness.
Zhu Yunwen raised his cup and finished it in one gulp, then continued, “Later on, there was a ‘power struggle’ between me and you, Fourth Uncle. Whether it was summoning you back to the capital, arranging the situation in Beiping, or enticing Yao Guangxiao to join us with the New Military Policy in Beiping, they were all part of my ‘strategy.’ I hoped that you could see the situation clearly, awaken from your delusion, and return to the right path.”
“I have speculated on every possible choice you might make, even the worst-case scenarios with King of Ning. Ha, I never expected that you would follow through with the worst possibilities, step by step. I knew your seemingly insane actions were just temporary expedients to buy time. In other words, you were already prepared to unsheathe your sword.”
“At this point, I still don’t want to give up on you, Fourth Uncle. That’s why I arranged for Ping An to capture of Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, as a warning to you. I also swiftly dispatched Yao Guangxiao, who just pledged allegiance to me, your trusted envoy to Beiping to be my final mediator!”
“Fourth Uncle, I have already made enough concessions, and there is no way for me to retreat any further. I have entrusted everything to Yao Guangxiao and to you.”
“I am deeply relieved that you, Fourth Uncle, can rein yourself in. It ensures that we won’t face each other in battle, the people won’t flee in exile, and the military won’t turn against itself. Great Ming won’t be consumed by flames of war! I am truly relieved! Come, Fourth Uncle, I toast to you!”
Zhu Di, filled with fear and unease, as well as overwhelming guilt, raised his cup and silently drank.
The heart of an emperor is as unfathomable as the sea.
But now, Zhu Yunwen had laid everything bare.
This expression of his heart was more touching and heartfelt than countless favors and rewards.
Zhu Di knelt down and performed a grand gesture of respect towards Zhu Yunwen, vowing, “As a servant of Your Majesty, I will never betray your favor! For all the past mistakes, I request that Your Majesty issue a punishment.”
Zhu Yunwen stood up, supporting Zhu Di, and with a slight drunkenness, he said, “Fourth Uncle, you haven’t understood. Today, there is no emperor, only uncle and nephew as a family. Let us be open and honest, clearing away any grievances in our hearts. You are still the uncle I value the most, the indomitable warrior of Great Ming! Come, I have finished speaking, now it’s your turn!”
Zhu Di sat back down, and with a series of consecutive cups, he sighed, “Your Majesty, this matter needs to be traced back to the twenty-fifth year of the Hongwu reign. The Crown Prince, following the decree of the founding emperor, sought a new capital in Xi’an. Not long after returning to the capital, he fell ill from a cold…”

Chapter 73: I need you, and the Ming Dynasty also need you.
Zhu Di looked down upon Zhu Yunwen’s father, Zhu Biao, considering him a weak scholar who only spoke of benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Although he possessed the highly esteemed virtues of a literary figure, he lacked the strategic prowess and grand vision required for territorial expansion and conquering the world.
However, Zhu Biao was still his elder brother, the legitimate eldest son of their father, Zhu Yuanzhang, and the rightful crown prince of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Di concealed his own ambitions and willingly accepted a position as a vassal king guarding the borders under the authority of Zhu Biao.
But in the twenty-fifth year of the Hongwu reign, Zhu Yuanzhang sent Zhu Biao to Xi’an to inspect whether it was suitable to be the capital of the Ming Empire. If it was deemed suitable, they would proceed with cutting trees and constructing houses, making preparations for an eventual move.
However, unexpectedly, after Zhu Biao made the trip and returned, whether due to the hardships of the journey or his own weakened physical condition, he fell ill from a cold and passed away.
That year, Zhu Yuanzhang was sixty-five years old, Zhu Yunwen was sixteen, and Zhu Di was thirty-three!
Although Zhu Di was saddened by the early departure of his elder brother, he shed a few tears, but within his tearful gaze, the image of the Dragon Throne always flickered.
With the death of his son, Zhu Yuanzhang, as a father, naturally experienced deep grief. After burying his own son, Zhu Yuanzhang, known for his iron will, had to consider an extremely important question.
The Crown Prince, Zhu Biao, was gone, and the legitimate heir of the Ming Empire was lost.
There was no choice but to select another one.
Zhu Yuanzhang looked up and saw that he still had over twenty sons. He decided to evaluate each one individually.
Regarding the Ming Dynasty’s system, Zhu Yuanzhang esteemed the feudal system of the Zhou Dynasty, with the core principle of primogeniture inheritance, known as “establishing the eldest son as the successor, not based on merit, and establishing sons based on nobility, not based on age.” At the same time, he learned from the Zhou Dynasty’s practice of extensive feudalism, appointing vassal kings to guard and protect the central authority.
From the perspective of legitimate sons, apart from the deceased Zhu Biao, there were only the second son, King of Qin, Zhu Shuang, the third son, King of Jin, Zhu Gang, and the fifth son, King of Zhouding, Zhu Su.
According to the principle of the eldest son succeeding in the absence of the older brother, the King of Qin, Zhu Shuang, should have taken over the position of the Crown Prince.
Unfortunately, this fellow entered a rebellious phase during his youth. No matter what his father said, Zhu Yuanzhang asked him to take care of the people, to recuperate and maintain stability, but he refused. He engaged in excessive construction projects, which burdened the people and wasted resources.
For most people, the rebellious phase may involve a few disagreements with their father or, in serious cases, running away from home for a few days.
But for the King of Qin, Zhu Shuang, it was different. As a King, he had soldiers and power, and no one to restrain him. One day he would engage in gold and silver transactions, killing commoners; the next day he would capture pregnant women and young girls, and castrate young boys.
On a free day, he would leisurely study how long a person could survive freezing to death in the snow, binding someone to a tree without food or water, observing how long they could endure, after that setting people on fire to appreciate their dance in the flames.
Zhu Yuanzhang’s evaluation of Zhu Shuang was, “He lacks understanding of human affairs and is as foolish as a beast.”
Considering his actions, it is not difficult to understand why Zhu Shuang was later poisoned by someone.
Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice but to exclude such a person from becoming the heir of the empire. He behaved like this as the King of Qin, If he became the emperor, wouldn’t the Ming Dynasty still face the risk of “perishing in the second generation”?”
The third son, King of Jin Zhu Gang, was also not a good thing. Although he had a decent appearance, he had many hidden schemes and was cruel and lacking in benevolence. If it weren’t for Zhu Biao’s protection, Zhu Yuanzhang would have deposed him long ago.
Apart from these two individuals, the fifth son was also not quite suitable. Among the older sons, Zhu Di, the fourth son sandwiched in between, although not the legitimate son, was relatively promising and possessed great talent, much like himself.
Should Zhu Di be chosen?
For three long months, Zhu Yuanzhang remained undecided, observing and contemplating each potential option.
No one was aware of Zhu Yuanzhang’s hesitation and internal struggle.
Historical records could not possibly capture Zhu Yuanzhang’s conflicts and anguish. Zhu Di waited at the crossroads of opportunity for three months, only to be kicked out by Zhu Yuanzhang.
Zhu Yunwen was proclaimed the Crown Prince!
With a cold and ruthless expression, Zhu Yuanzhang closed the door of hope for Zhu Di and embarked on a path of bloodshed, eliminating all the military commanders to pave the way for his own grandson.
In fact, according to the normal order of succession, it shouldn’t have been Zhu Yunwen, but his younger brother Zhu Yunteng.
Zhu Yunteng was the son of Zhu Di’s principal wife, Lady Chang. Unfortunately, Lady Chang passed away before completing her postpartum recovery. It was only after Lady Chang’s death that Zhu Yunwen’s mother, Lady Lv, was promoted to the position of principal wife, granting Zhu Yunwen the status of a legitimate son.
In other words, Zhu Yunwen was just a bastard who later received a certificate of legitimacy.
Zhu Di’s dissatisfaction was justified. His father showed favoritism. It was one thing not to choose the Crown Prince from among his own sons, but within Zhu Biao’s lineage, they even resorted to the practice of “elevating the illegitimate over the legitimate.”
It was a blatant injustice!
Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice. The military faction behind Zhu Yunteng was too powerful. His mother, Lady Chang, was the daughter of Chang Yuchun and the niece of Lan Yu. If Zhu Yunteng were to ascend to the throne, Lan Yu and his ilk would inevitably control the court, posing a threat to the Ming Dynasty.
On the other hand, Zhu Yunwen had only civil officials behind him, with no risk of the usurpation of power by powerful relatives. Even so, Zhu Yuanzhang was still wary of Lan Yu. In the second year after Zhu Yunwen’s ascension, he initiated the “Lan Yu case.”
The killing began, the situation changed, and over 15,000 people were buried in the dying embers of the Hongwu era.
Zhu Di, with a scent of alcohol, poured out the painful and uneasy times, releasing all his grievances, discontent, and indignation. Zhu Di, who was always reserved and profound, now resembled a child who had suffered countless grievances, tears streaming down his face.
“I refuse to accept it!” Zhu Di shouted loudly.
The sound echoed through the hall of the Kunning Palace, only to be shattered by the cold palace walls.
Zhu Yunwen listening to Zhu Di’s confession, without reservation he revealed everything, the suppression by Zhu Yuanzhang, the relentless burning ambition, the unwavering determination in the face of fate, and the enduring resilience despite humiliation and burden…
On the table, five jars of wine were already empty.
Zhu Di staggered and still pushed away Xu Yihua’s support. He looked at Zhu Yunwen and gave a bitter smile before saying, “I was wrong. In terms of means, strategies, overall situation, military affairs, and the welfare of the nation and the people, I am no match for you. Zhu Yunwen, you are the truly deserving emperor of the Great Ming!”
Zhu Yunwen stepped forward, assisting the intoxicated and fallen Zhu Di. Xu Yihua hurriedly approached to provide support. With a sorrowful smile, she said to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, the King of Yan has made mistakes, and so has the humble concubine. Please issue an imperial decree to punish us.”
Although Xu Yihua was Zhu Di’s closest confidante, there were certain things, certain words that Zhu Di couldn’t express to her.
Today, in the Kunning Palace, Xu Yihua for the first time sensed the immense pain and struggle hidden in Zhu Di’s heart.
Xu Yihua did not blame Zhu Di. He was her man, and whether he rebelled and was killed or was reduced to a commoner, she would accompany him to the end, remaining together until death, never abandoning him.
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and said to Xu Yihua, “Lady Xu, you worry too much. If punishment is necessary, why would it require coming to the capital? Empress, have someone escort fourth uncle and his consort back to their residence. I am also intoxicated.”
Ma Enhui nodded with a smile, and Shuangxi and the others entered the hall, arranging a carriage to send Zhu Di and Xu Yihua out of the palace. By the time Ma Enhui returned to the Kunning Palace, Zhu Yunxuan had already fallen into a deep and peaceful sleep.
The greatest flaw of a royal family is its deep secrets, everything shrouded in mystery, leaving room for speculation, without revealing everything. A smile may not indicate happiness, and tears may not indicate sadness.
Exaggerated expressions, excessive theatrics.
But now, everything was laid bare, casting off the burdens of the past and shouldering the responsibilities of the future, standing tall and proud, advancing with determination!
Zhu Di, in this life, follow me faithfully.
I need you, and the Ming Dynasty needs you!

Chapter 74: Japanese pirates? Execute them all, no need for surrender.
Capital, King of Yan mansion.
Zhu Di leaned against the bed, his eyes groggy and unfocused. He occasionally rubbed his temples.
Xu Yihua brought a bowl of plain porridge and asked with concern, “Your Highness, do you have a headache?”
Zhu Di took the porridge and sighed, saying, “The wine was good, but it was too intoxicating. Ten barrels of wine were nothing to me in the past, but yesterday, I only had five with someone.”
Xu Yihua sat nearby, looking at Zhu Di tenderly, and said, “Your Highness, I heard that it was strong liquor, not the usual kind.”
After taking a sip of porridge and feeling a bit better, Zhu Di sniffed the air in the room and frowned, asking, “Did I vomit last night?”
Xu Yihua smiled and replied, “Your Highness, have you really forgotten? You did it three times. I don’t know why you drank so much. What if it harms your health? What should we do then?”
Zhu Di chuckled and handed the bowl to Xu Yihua. He got up from the bed and said, “If I haven’t drunk so much. I wouldn’t have had the courage to speak those words. If the Emperor wants me to be open and honest, then I’ll show him clearly and make him understand.”
Xu Yihua furrowed her brows in worry, looking at Zhu Di.
Seeing her concern, Zhu Di gently took Xu Yihua’s hand and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t oppose the Emperor again. We are safe now. Send a letter to Chi’er[1]Tl’s note: Zhu Di’s Eldest Son Zhu Gaochi and the others, asking them not to worry.”
With her worries eased, Xu Yihua nodded earnestly. Then, she seemed to think of something and added, “Your Highness, the King of Liao and King of Min territories have been taken away.”
“What?”
Zhu Di was instantly startled.
Xu Yihua walked to the side of the table, picked up a document, and handed it to Zhu Di, saying, “The two kings engaged in business, which goes against ancestral traditions. The decision to take back their fiefdoms serves as punishment.”
After carefully reading the document, Zhu Di asked, “Is it true that the medical gauze and alcohol were produced by the two kings?”
Xu Yihua shook her head and said, “It’s not clear, but it’s true that the two kings’ mansions purchased weaving materials and procured alcohol. However, there are also rumors, though quite absurd…”
“What rumors?” Zhu Di asked curiously.
Xu Yihua smiled and said, “Rumors say that the medical gauze and alcohol are actually produced in the imperial harem, and the two kings merely sold them. Does Your Highness find this amusing? If the imperial harem could produce these items, why would they trade them through the Ministry of War?”
A glint flashed in Zhu Di’s eyes, and he couldn’t help but move his lips when he saw the words “take back their fiefdoms” in the document. He said, “Absurd? Haha, when I had rebellious intentions, the Emperor forgave my actions. To outsiders, wouldn’t that also seem absurd?”
Xu Yihua was stunned, and in an instant, she understood. She asked with astonishment, “Your Highness, this, this can’t be true, right?”
Absurdity is the truth?
What are the Emperor and Empress trying to achieve with this?
Zhu Di realized the situation, and his mood improved greatly. He smiled and said, “The Emperor has played a good hand. Come, help me put on my court attire; I’m going to attend the court session!”
Xu Yihua hurriedly advised, “Your Highness, you were heavily drunk yesterday and haven’t fully rested yet. How can you go to court? Besides, many officials already have grievances against you. If you attend the session, it might invite impeachments. Why put yourself through that?”
Zhu Di smiled and remained silent, gesturing for Xu Yihua to prepare his court attire.
Fengtian Hall.
With the ceremonial music starting, the officials entered the hall following the rhythm.
“His Majesty is attending the court session!”
An eunuch shouted loudly.
Zhu Yunwen walked along the central path into the main hall, and the officials kneeled and paid their respects, shouting “long live the emperor.”
Zhu Yunwen took his seat and raised his hand, saying, “Please rise.”
The sound of the emperor’s voice resonated through the Fengtian Hall as the bells were struck. The officials kowtowed and thanked the emperor, then stood up, preparing to present their reports for the day.
From a tray held by a nearby eunuch, Zhu Yunwen took a memorial and said, “Dengzhou Guard’s Assistant Commander Qi Bin has come to report that there have been Japanese pirates appearing along the coast of Shandong. If I remember correctly, there should be similar reports from the coastal regions of Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang as well, right?”
Xu Huizu stepped forward and said, “Your Majesty, last year, there were twenty-one reports of Japanese pirates in Fujian and seventeen reports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Some groups were small, consisting of only a few individuals, while others were larger, with around a hundred members.”
“Hmph, Japanese pirates, Japanese pirates!” Zhu Yunwen clenched his teeth, speaking with a fierce tone.
This hatred shocked the court officials.
Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, and others were also taken aback. The Emperor’s emotions were quite intense. Even when there were reports of pirates in Guangzhou last year, he did not display such anger.
“How were these situations dealt with in various regions?” Zhu Yunwen suppressed his anger and asked.
Xu Huizu quickly replied, “The local garrisons have strengthened their defenses, but the Japanese pirates are scattered, and the results have been minimal.”
“Defenses? How can the people of Great Ming be humiliated by Japanese pirates! Announce to all the garrisons that once the Japanese pirates invade, they must be completely annihilated! Didn’t Qi Bin wants to go to sea to kill the Japanese pirates, then give him ships! Inform the coastal provinces that any Japanese pirates who harm our people of Great Ming are to be executed on the spot, no need for surrender, no need for escort!”
Zhu Yunwen issued the command with a chilling aura.
The court officials were trembling with fear.
This was the first time since Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne that he had issued such a ruthless and merciless command.
The military officials like Xu Huizu were filled with excitement.
Heavens, the generals finally have some action to take! We’ve been so idle!
It’s no wonder; the local regions are peaceful, and the borders are secure, except for a few issues in the southwest at Luchuan, there’s not much to do.
Though there are new army policies, endless days of training are not the solution. After all, how much military merit can one earn through training alone?
Soldiers join the army to protect their homeland and establish their military achievements!
Now, even though the scale of the Japanese pirates is not significant, they are still harming the people of Great Ming. As soldiers, how can they tolerate this?
Let’s go!
Xu Huizu clasped his hands and said, “Your Majesty, I am willing to personally go to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region to quell the Japanese pirates troubles!”
Xie Jin rubbed his forehead, looking at Xu Huizu speechless.
First, Duke Li Jinglong went to Guangzhou to deal with small-scale pirates, now Duke Xu Huizu is going to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to deal with the Japanese pirates? You are all Dukes, Can’t you be more stable, no matter how much merit you achieved, you can’t get promoted anymore.
“I believe that this matter should not involve the Dukes. I recommend three individuals who can handle the maritime affairs!” Xie Jin stepped forward and shouted.
“Oh, whom does official Xie recommend?” Zhu Yunwen asked with interest.
Xie Jin confidently said, “Your Majesty, I recommend Vice Admiral of the Navy, Zheng He, as the main commander, and King of Yan’s subordinates, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, as his deputies. They will surely quell the maritime troubles.”
“Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng are both land-based generals. How can they serve as naval deputies?” Jing Qing interjected.
Xie Jin retorted, “Before Zheng He became Vice Admiral, he had never seen the sea either. Now his navy is highly elite. How can you official Jing, know whether they are suitable or not?”
Jing Qing sternly replied, “They are convicted criminals!”
“What crimes have they committed?!” Xie Jin asked.
Jing Qing opened his mouth but couldn’t clearly explain.
Whether Zhu Di was guilty or where his crime lay, the people from the Censorate couldn’t explain it clearly. The confidential documents were delivered through channels operated by the Great Ming Security Bureau and did not pass through the office of transmission.
They could only speculate and use Zhu Di’s pretended madness as an excuse to impeach him of “deceiving the emperor and concealing his true intentions.”
However, the Emperor publicly announced that Zhu Di was ill.
Therefore, the impeachment of deceiving the emperor and concealing his true intentions did not hold.
“Let’s go along with official Xie’s suggestion. Appoint Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng as naval deputies, accompanying Zheng He to eliminate the Japanese pirates! This matter is decided. Now, let’s discuss the land disputes!” Zhu Yunwen decisively moved on, turning to the most important topic of the court session today.
If they didn’t resolve the land disputes and curb land annexation, the future destiny of Great Ming would be nothing but the tragedy of “the ruler dies, and the state falls”!

Chapter 75: Dynamic Model Reveals Land Consolidation
Land consolidation has a long history in China.
From the Spring and Autumn period to the Great Ming Dynasty, for nearly sixteen centuries, the issue of land consolidation has never been eradicated. The rise and fall of almost every dynasty have been closely linked to land consolidation.
In the early stages of a dynasty, land consolidation may not be severe, but as time goes on, it becomes more pronounced and eventually leads to collapse.
During the reign of Zhu Yunwen, land consolidation had already become apparent, but it was not yet considered severe, thanks to the overall conditions in the early Ming Dynasty.
After the war at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, a large number of landlords died, and the new landlord class had not fully recovered. It took over a decade or two to slowly regain momentum, and just when a new group of landlords emerged, Zhu Yuanzhang made some sweeping changes, leading to the destruction of many “middle-class families among the common people.”
Zhu Yunwen understood the concept of land consolidation; after all, Chinese people have a unique attachment to land. Without land, how can one feed oneself? If one can’t solve the issue of livelihood, how can one start a family? Moreover, a hundred years later, one needs a place to settle down; one can’t just live on someone else’s land.
For merchants, the first choice after becoming wealthy is to purchase land. Among the four occupations (scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants), merchants hold the lowest status.
Once they become prosperous, they would buy a thousand acres of land to show those poor villagers that they are more than just merchants; they also own land. They won’t be looked down upon anymore.
Then they return home, pat their son who has failed the imperial examinations nine times on the head, and tell him, “Son, eat an extra bowl of dinner. We have plenty of land at home, and you won’t go hungry. Don’t worry, if you don’t pass this year, wait for another three years. Once you pass, our family will rise, and we won’t be merchants anymore; we’ll be a scholarly family.”
As this gentleman reached his advanced years, the heavens finally smiled upon him, and he succeeded in passing the imperial examination.
What glory it brought!
With a newfound status, everything changed. How could a mere one thousand mu of land be enough for him? He decided to acquire five thousand mu!
What? The foolish neighbor refuses to sell his land? No worries, invite the local village head over for a feast.
Oh, the foolish neighbor decided to sell his land after all? Asking for half a mace silver per mu? Ridiculous! I’ll take thirty mu and give him five taels of silver.
What’s that? The foolish neighbor went to the county office to seek justice? Let’s go and pay a visit to the county magistrate.
What’s with that new mound of earth over there? Oh, it was leveled, but I still need to farm!
Taxes? I’m an unappointed scholar, don’t you understand the law? Unappointed scholars are entitled to a tax exemption for two thousand mu of land! My land is precisely two thousand mu, all exempt from taxes.
Whose land is that? How would I know?
For merchants buying land, apart from providing for their future generations, they often seek transformation into the scholar class.
Even if they have no hope in this lifetime, they still have children. As long as there is land, they won’t go hungry. For generations to come, after a hundred or two hundred years, there will always be a chance for them to succeed.
Unappointed scholars buy land, and appointed officials also buy land. When they grow old or retire, they still need to buy land in their hometown.
As for those kings, they are even more powerful – the whole world belongs to their family, why would they need to buy land? They just seize it, and the land becomes part of the king’s mansion.
Oh, I remember now, yesterday the emperor rewarded me with one million mu of land. What? Jiangxi doesn’t have that much land? No problem, one must learn to be flexible. If there’s no land in Jiangxi, then we’ll go to Fujian, Hubei! If that doesn’t work, we’ll go to Guangzhou. In short, whatever the emperor grants, not a single mu of land should be missing!
Zhu Yunwen sighed. Thinking about the tragic state of the late Ming Dynasty, he was filled with frustration. Such a vast empire, with millions of mu of land and over sixty million people, couldn’t even collect a tax of two hundred thousand taels of silver! The expansive empire was as weak as rotten wood, vulnerable to a single blow!
Zhu Yunwen made up his mind; no matter how great the resistance, he must restrain land consolidation during his reign!
The debate among the courtiers resumed, and to Zhu Yunwen’s surprise, although the Head Minister of Six Ministries had expressed their views, there were still many voices opposing land consolidation. The various officials also jumped in to refute Hu Jun and the Six Ministries.
“Enough!” Zhu Yunwen’s voice resounded.
The courtiers ceased their discussions and looked at Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t speak but glanced at Shuangxi at the side.
Shuangxi hurriedly left the Fengtian Hall, and not long after, eight eunuchs carried in a long table. On the table was a sand table of the South Zhili region of the Ming Empire, along with two eunuchs holding black lacquer buckets, standing by the sand table.
The courtiers were puzzled at the sight.
Jing Qing looked at the yellow and black-dyed sand on the sand table and asked Lian Zining beside him, “What does this mean?”
Lian Zining shook his head slightly and said, “I’m not sure, but we’ll know soon.”
Jing Qing frowned and carefully observed Lian Zining, saying, “You’ve been quite silent these past few days. Could it be that Hu Jun’s memorial made you abandon your initial convictions?”
Lian Zining glanced at Jing Qing indifferently and coldly said, “All convictions should align with the right path. If one’s convictions are wrong, they must have the courage to repent. Official Jing, don’t ruin a lifetime of integrity for the sake of a few thousand mu of land at home.”
“Humph, it’s not about the land for me, but the welfare of the people. If the court restricts the gentry from buying and selling land, once there’s a natural disaster and poor harvest, how will self-sustaining farmers survive? They’ll have to turn to the gentry. But because of the court’s regulations, the gentry won’t dare to buy and sell land and will close their doors, shutting the farmers out. Then, they’ll become refugees, begging for survival everywhere, living and dying away from their hometowns. Do you want to see such a scene, official Lian?” Jing Qing replied coldly.
Lian Zining’s lips twitched but refrained from retorting. There’s no point in arguing with someone fixated on just one aspect; it’s a waste of energy.
Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, and others walked around the sand table, then looked at Zhu Yunwen.
Huang Zicheng raised his tablet and asked, “Your Majesty, what is the purpose of this sand table?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly and shouted, “Step aside, Xia Yuanji!”
Xia Yuanji came forward and replied loudly, “Present!”
Zhu Yunwen asked, “Within the area shown on this sand table, how much land is there, how many people, how many mu of land, and how much tax and grain are there? Can you explain it clearly?”
Xia Yuanji asked, “Your Majesty, which year are you inquiring about?”
Zhu Yunwen saw Xia Yuanji’s composure and nodded slightly, saying, “Let’s start with the twenty-sixth year of the Hongwu reign.”
Xia Yuji walked toward the sand table, saying, “Your Majesty, this is the territory of the South Zhili region of the Great Ming, encompassing fourteen prefectures, including Yingtian Prefecture, Suzhou Prefecture, Fengyang Prefecture, Huai’an Prefecture, Yangzhou Prefecture, Songjiang Prefecture, and Huizhou Prefecture. There are 1,917,914 households and a population of 10,755,974. There are 126,960,000 mu of farmland, with a total tax and grain of 7,234,820 dan.”
After hearing Xia Yuanji’s report, Zhu Yunwen was secretly amazed. Xia Yuanji’s abilities were indeed remarkable; he was undaunted even in sudden investigations like this. It seemed that he should be entrusted with managing the Ministry of Revenue in the future.
Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and pointed to the sand table, saying, “The yellow-colored portion on this sand table represents the farmland of the South Zhili region in the twenty-sixth year of the Hongwu reign, which is exactly 126,960,000 mu. The black-colored portion represents the land owned by gentry, mainly salary fields and tax-exempt fields, so we won’t consider them for now. Minister Xia, can you tell us how much farmland there was in the South Zhili region in the twenty-seventh year of the Hongwu reign?”
“Your Majesty, it was 123,960,000 mu, which is 300,000 mu less than in the twenty-sixth year of the Hongwu reign,” Xia Yuanji replied solemnly.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the two eunuchs beside the sand table. The eunuchs took out black brushes from the lacquer buckets and applied some black ink on the sand table. Then, they stepped aside.
“In the twenty-eighth year of the Hongwu reign, how much farmland was there in the South Zhili region?” Zhu Yunwen asked again.
The courtiers fell silent, and all eyes were fixed on the sand table.
With each number reported by Xia Yuji, a portion of the original yellow-colored area on the sand table was covered with black ink. Every time black ink covered the yellow, the hearts of the courtiers trembled slightly.

Chapter 76: Disbanding the Harem, Yet Still Unable to Support Officials
Yellow represents the emperor, while black represents the gentry.
Though the sand table appeared simple, the colors were distinct. Every time the black area expanded by one mu, the yellow area diminished by one mu.
The previously scattered black dots now showed a tendency to connect, creating a visually shocking display that rattled everyone in the court.
Xie Jin was astonished by this method. Using the sand table to illustrate the changes in farmland was remarkably clear and easy to understand. Although familiar with sand tables, he had never considered this particular application.
Familiar things could take on new and fresh uses. Those who can think and adapt will find limitless possibilities in their endeavors, a sign of a wise person. And His Majesty was indeed a wise ruler.
“What about the taxed farmland area in the 30th year of Hongwu?” Zhu Yunwen asked in a stern voice.
“Your Majesty, in the 30th year of Hongwu, the taxed farmland area amounted to 99,570,000 mu, a reduction of 27,390,000 mu compared to the 26th year of Hongwu!”
His voice caused a collective gasp among the courtiers. As the eunuch brushed more black ink onto the sand table, the yellow area was further reduced, and the additional black color became even more pronounced.
“What about the 31st year of Hongwu?” Zhu Yunwen asked again.
Xia Yuanji’s voice carried a hint of suppressed anger and sorrow as he replied, “In the 31st year of Hongwu, the taxed farmland area amounted to 87,560,000 mu, a reduction of 39,400,000 mu compared to the 26th year of Hongwu!”
The entire court was shocked.
Watching the significant reduction of the yellow area on the sand table and the overwhelming presence of black, occupying more than a third of the territory.
Zhu Yunwen couldn’t help but feel heartbroken and angry. “Only five years!” he exclaimed with grief and fury. “In just five years, the taxed farmland area in South Zhili has decreased by nearly 40 million mu! Xia Yuanji, tell me, how much is the tax of southern zhili region in the 31st year of Hongwu?”
Stepping forward, Xia Yuanji replied with a voice full of melancholy, “Your Majesty, in the 31st year of Hongwu, the summer tax in South Zhili was 3,150,261 dan. As for the autumn tax, it has not been fully delivered due to the Single whip method. However, after inspecting the seven prefectures, I estimate it to be close to 400 dan, totaling approximately 7,000,000 shi, which is equivalent to the 26th year of Hongwu.”
Looking at his courtiers, Zhu Yunwen spoke with a harsh tone, “Very well, excellent! Hou Tai, tell me, how is it possible that the taxed farmland area decreased by 40 million mu in five years, yet the tax revenue remains the same?”
Hou Tai, the Minister of Justice, stepped forward, his face pale and weak. He replied in a powerless tone, “I do not know!”
“Do you really not know, or do you dare not speak?” Zhu Yunwen coldly rebuked, no longer bothering to look at the kneeling Hou Tai. Instead, he turned his gaze to Jing Qing and asked, “Jing Qing, do you know why?”
Kneeling on the side, Jing Qing shouted, “I… I don’t know!”
“Hmph! Land disputes, land disputes! After debating for so many days, you dare to say you don’t know? Then all the memorials you copied, the continuous debates, have all been in vain?” Zhu Yunwen asked angrily.
Seeing no one speaking up, Zhu Yunwen turned to Huang Zicheng and asked, “Huang Zicheng, tell them, what method was used to decrease the land but not the tax revenue?”
Stepping forward, Huang Zicheng spoke with a deep voice, “The local governments cleverly devised new names and secretly increased taxes, burdening the remaining taxed farmland areas. Though nearly 40 million mu have been reduced, the tax revenue from these 40 million mu is distributed evenly among the remaining 87,560,000 mu!”
“Good, very good!” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xia Yuanji and asked, “In your opinion, how much will the tax and farmland area decrease in South Zhili this year?”
Xia Yuanji was taken aback and calculated for a moment before saying, “Your Majesty, based on past years, the taxed farmland area in South Zhili will decrease by at least eight million mu this year.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly.
Eight million mu was a conservative estimate.
Xia Yuanji thought that since it decreased by 40 million mu in five years, the average yearly decrease would be around 8 million mu. However, he forgot to consider the trend. In the first year, it only decreased by three million mu, but in the most recent year, it surged to 12 million mu!
The results presented by the mean are only the mean, and sometimes it had no representativeness or ability to reveal future possibilities.
But since Xia Yuanji said so, they would proceed accordingly.
The two eunuchs applied more black ink on the sand table, indicating that another eight million mu of tax and farmland would be divided.
“Is it acceptable to calculate the next year’s decrease as eight million mu as well?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
With a bitter tone, Xia Yuanji replied, “It’s acceptable.”
“Then do it!” Zhu Yunwen said coldly.
The eunuchs applied black ink again.
In the third year of Jianwen, another eight million mu was decreased, leaving roughly this much farmland remaining…
In the fourth year of Jianwen, another eight million mu was decreased, leaving roughly this much farmland remaining…
…
In the tenth year of Jianwen, another eight million mu was decreased, leaving approximately 7,560,000 mu of farmland.
By this point, the sand table had turned pitch black, and the yellow area was reduced to just a small, pitiful amount.
“Xia Yuanji, according to the 1/15 tax, how much tax will be collected from these 7,560,000 mu of farmland? One mu of land is taxed 1 dou and 3 sheng, so how much revenue will it generate?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Xia Yuanji calculated on his bamboo board and replied, “Your Majesty, from 7,560,000 mu, it will yield approximately 990,000 dan in taxes, equivalent to 530,000 taels of silver. After setting aside 160,000 taels for local use, the court will receive 370,000 taels.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the courtiers, his tone becoming icy as he shouted, “In ten years, the entire South Zhili will only generate 370,000 taels of tax revenue! Haha, just 370,000 taels! What can you do with that? The annual expenses of the imperial harem alone amount to 350,000 taels! If I dismiss the harem, I can only save 300,000 taels. Is that enough to pay your salaries?!”
“With over 30,000 civil and military officials, dividing this amount among them would mean each person receives only ten taels of silver per year. Are you willing to accept that? It’s not even enough to buy two dan of rice per month! Who among you is willing to stand here and work for the country?”
“Who?!”
“South Zhili is a vital area for the Ming Dynasty’s tax collection. If it is still like this, how can we afford to pay your salaries? How can we afford to maintain the military? The consequences of land disputes are not limited to ten years; what about fifty years from now? A hundred years? Two hundred years? You are the subjects of the Ming Dynasty, and you should consider not only yourselves but also future generations!”
“You took the land from the self-cultivating farmers and made the tenant farmers toil for you. You have plenty of food in your homes, but what about the court? What about the Ming Dynasty? If the Ming Dynasty falls, who among you can live under the hooves of the northern barbarians for the rest of your life? Or are you willing to become fourth-class citizens, bowing to the whims of foreign invaders?!”
Zhu Yunwen’s words were like a torrential storm, pouring out with force.
Those officials who had opposed the land disputes suddenly realized that this seemingly ordinary issue was, in fact, life-threatening. It might not be about their own lives, but it was about the fate of the Ming Dynasty.
If the Ming Dynasty collapsed, their own lives wouldn’t be better off.
If another Yuan Dynasty emerged, all their wealth would be handed over to the barbarians, and they would be living a lowly life.
“The consequences of land disputes are like a plague, eating away at us day and night, weakening our Ming Dynasty. We must thoroughly investigate and strictly control it!” The sonorous voice echoed out from the entrance of Fengtian Hall, causing everyone to turn their heads.
Zhu Di strode in, and upon reaching the front of the hall, he performed a deep bow before exclaiming, “I, Zhu Di, pay my respects to Your Majesty! Long live our Your Majesty, long live, long live!”
“King of Yan, rise quickly,” Zhu Yunwen said with some surprise at Zhu Di’s sudden arrival, but it seemed that he was prepared for it.
Zhu Di stood up, looked at the sand table, and then said to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, the court should implement strict laws to regulate land consolidation and curb the trend of land entrusting. I implore Your Majesty to abolish all official lands and tax-exempt land! All farmlands should be subject to taxation! I am willing to hand over all my fiefs’ lands to the common people of the Ming Dynasty, enabling them to live in peace and prosperity, cultivating for thousands of years!”

Chapter 77: The ancestral rule is only practiced in the tombs of the Xiaoling Mausoleum.
Abolish the official lands and tax-exempt lands?!
Zhu Di’s words caused the officials to take a deep breath, each of them looking miserable and dejected.
What are they seeking as officials?
To leave a mark in history?
To be remembered for generations?
To benefit all of humanity?
Don’t joke around; those are pursuits of the ambitious.
As officials, we seek a piece of land, a bit of privilege. If these privileges were taken away, how would we survive?
Just relying on the imperial court’s pitiful salary of a few dan or a dozen dan every month?
Without the land we possess, we would be eating coarse rice every day, living in shabby houses, and wearing tattered clothes.
After much difficulty, we managed to acquire some land and money, after struggling for half a year, go to the Qingyan Tower to see our beloved. And now, these beloved ones wouldn’t even recognize them. Do you think it is easy for us?
However, when they looked at the pitch-black sand table, they felt somewhat helpless.
If the scenario depicted by this sand table continues, in ten years, thirty years or more, their own tomb is still unfinished, the funeral bells of the Ming Dynasty would have already tolled…
Damn Zhu Di!
It was rumored that you went insane, and now it seems to be true.
Only an insane man would say such things.
His single sentence has offended all the gentry; a sane person wouldn’t dare to do such a thing.
He wanted to burn himself and shine brightly for the sake of the Great Ming, but why must he drag everyone else into the abyss?
Oppose him?
Who dares to voice opposition now?
The Emperor is clearly on the verge of a rampage. His question “are you guys willing to become fourth-class citizens, bowing to the whims of foreign invaders?” forces everyone to consider the destiny of the Great Ming. Anyone without a sense of the bigger picture will be best off taking off their official robes and returning home to farm.
Didn’t you see Hou Tai sitting weakly on the ground, unable to utter a word?
Didn’t you see Jing Qing looking dejected and remaining silent?
When the leaders dared not oppose, naturally, no one else would.
With a cold and imposing gaze, Zhu Yunwen swept his eyes over everyone, and no one dared to meet his gaze, bowing their heads one by one.
“The calamity of land disputes will harm our descendants! If we do nothing about it, our descendants will have no future! I have decided to thoroughly investigate the lands of the Great Ming. All the lands owned by kings, officials, wealthy gentry, rich farmers, and self-cultivating farmers will be subject to investigation! If anyone obstructs, their lands will be confiscated and distributed to the common people!”
Zhu Yunwen’s resolute decision left everyone stunned. This would signify that the Ming Dynasty’s land inspection would be reopened, and this time, the scale and intensity would far surpass the previous Hongwu reign!
“As for the official lands and tax-exempt lands, they will all be taxed at the rate of 1/15. For any lands beyond the stipulated official lands, they will be taxed at the rate of 1/5. All gentry’s lands will be investigated for their origins, and any lands obtained through coercion or expropriation will be returned. For each mu of land, they will be required to compensate self-cultivating farmers with one tael of silver!”
“In the future, all land transactions will be managed by local agriculture tax offices, supervised by the auditing office, and reported to the Provincial Administration Department! Don’t mention anything about ancestral rules! The ancestral rule is at Xiaoling Mausoleum! If anyone desires the founding emperor’s system, then from tomorrow onwards, they need not enter the court and can directly go to the Xiaoling Mausoleum to kneel there! Do any of you have objections?”
The officials’ faces turned pale!
With such words, who would dare to object?!
But, you playing this hand means most of the land in the country will be distributed to farmers.
The tax rate of 1/15 on official lands can still be accepted, but the land outside the official salary land, which is subject to a 1/5 rate, is a heavy burden! Then, why should I keep this land?
After deducting taxes, how much will be left for us if we lease the land to tenant farmers?
If the harvest is poor, and after a year, only one dou of grain can be stored in the granary from one mu of land, wouldn’t they be crying to death?
It seems that they can only rely on official lands to make a living.
For those local gentry, their situation will be even worse.
Who doesn’t have a bit of dirt on himselves?
Coercion, oppression, and secret manipulation. If this doesn’t work, they will find a stray dog to bite them. All the money will be used for medical treatment, and when there’s no money left, they will have to sell the land.
There are many ways to take away their land, but who could have thought that the court would thoroughly investigate the sources of their lands? If tenant farmers say that their land was seized from them, then it’s all over. Not only will they have to return the land, but they will also have to compensate the self-cultivating farmers with one tael of silver per mu!
The Emperor’s move is like wanting to extract flesh from the gentry!
“Since there are no objections, then let us not cause any further disturbance in the future! The Grand Secretariat has ten days to present statutes and methods, carefully considering any deficiencies and making sufficient preparations. After the ten-day period, the powers to inspect and regulate land holdings will be entrusted to the tax inspection teams, to curb the trends of land consolidation and land entrusting.”
After Zhu Yunwen finished speaking, he looked deeply at Zhu Di before leaving the throne and heading to the harem.
After Zhu Yunwen left, the court officials did not depart from the Fengtian hall; they remained inside and engaged in discussions.
“Secretary Xie, how can this be good? If we proceed with this plan, we will suffer great losses! How can we sustain ourselves with these meager salaries?” Right Censor Lian Zining approached Xie Jin, his face gloomy.
The other officials quieted down upon hearing this and looked at Xie Jin.
Xie Jin clapped his hands and gave a slight nod to Zhu Di, then addressed Lian Zining and the other officials, “Gentlemen, we have all witnessed the implications of the land disputes through this demonstration on the sand table. His Majesty has no choice; if he does not act like this, the entire sand table would be consumed by black, with no yellow left.”
“Secretary Xie, We understand the reasoning, but if things continue like this, we will have no way to survive,” sighed Lu Yi, Vice Director of the Ministry of Personnel.
Xie Jin chuckled and said, “How do you know that His Majesty hasn’t considered our concerns? He is a wise ruler and would not let us go hungry.”
“Oh? What do you mean?” the officials asked eagerly.
With the officials showing renewed enthusiasm, Xie Jin smiled and continued, “His Majesty has issued an edict to the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of Revenue, calling for a reassessment of official salaries. Although the details are still uncertain, I can assure you all that the new salaries will be significantly increased from the current levels.”
“Really?” Lian Zining and others showed delight on their faces.
Though they knew that the new salaries might not fully make up for their losses, any improvement was welcomed.
Xie Jin clapped his hands again, signaling the officials to calm down, and said, “Everyone, His Majesty has shown mercy. He has given you all ten days to handle your land properties. I believe you all know what to do during this period. Once the Grand Secretariat presents its strategy, you must act according to the law.”
The officials nodded in agreement.
Returning the lands they had taken from others as soon as possible would at least prevent them from compensating others for the loss.
If they waited for the imperial decree to be issued and circulated throughout the country, not only would they lose their lands, but they would also have to pay compensation.
One mu of land costs one tael of silver, so for someone who has taken eight thousand mu of land, wouldn’t they have to cough up a lot of blood?
Outside gate of Jiangdong.
Zhu Geng wiped his sweat and said to Zhu Zhi, who seemed calm and composed, “Will this plan work? We’ve invested six thousand taels of silver, and if we lose, we’ll truly have to eat cold steamed buns.”
Zhu Zhi sat on a reclining chair, leisurely swinging his legs, and replied, “Don’t worry. The court officials haven’t made their way to office yet. Once they do, they’ll be the ones in a hurry.”
Meanwhile, Left Censor in Chief of the Censorate Jing Qing returned to his residence and hastily wrote a letter. He called for two servants and solemnly instructed them, “This letter is of utmost importance. It must be delivered promptly to Zhenning, Shanxi. Hand it over personally to my grandmother and ensure she acts on it without any delay!”

Chapter 78: The Special Characteristic of Ming Dynasty’s Official Salaries Only a Word
Jing Qing lost both of his parents at a young age and lived with his maternal grandmother. The two family servants were from Jing Qing’s grandmother’s side, and they were delighted to have the opportunity to return home, despite the long journey. They quickly agreed, packed their belongings, and exclaimed, “We’re going!” before leaving.
However, they returned shortly after, complaining to Jing Qing that the travel expenses were not enough, sir give me a bit more?
Infuriated, Jing Qing asked if the thirty taels of silver he gave them from Nanjing to Zhenning were insufficient?
Did they think he sent them on a sightseeing tour of the Ming Dynasty’s landscape?
Are they looking for beating?
After Jing Qing took out the whip, they knelt and tearfully pleaded, “Master, outside the city, horses require a deposit of fifteen taels, and the daily rental cost is one tael of silver. For a round trip, it would take at least fifty days, which amounts to fifty taels. Please consider…”
Jing Qing couldn’t contain his anger. Who on earth had become so shameless as to charge one tael of silver for horse rental when it used to cost only three hundred wens per day? When did the prices suddenly soar like this?
Also, they dare to demand a deposit from officials of the Censorate.
“Don’t you know to try another place?” Jing Qing suppressed his rage.
The servants cried out, “Master, we already inquired, but the horses within three hundred li of the capital have all been bought by the King of Liao and King of Min and they’ve even signed contracts…”
Jing Qing felt a headache coming on. King of Liao and King of Min?
Weren’t they the two kings whose titles were revoked, and they became merchants?
It is truly despicable to the extreme! They reveal their deceitful merchant nature within a few days of engaging in business!
“Tell them it’s the Censorate wants the horse!” Jing Qing gritted his teeth.
Anxiously, the servant replied, “Master, it was because we mentioned your name that the initial deposit required was ten taels, but now it’s fifteen taels…”
Jing Qing clenched his fists tightly and took a deep breath!
The King of Liao and King of Min are seeking revenge through private means!
The Censorate had frequently impeached these two, and now, when they urgently needed someone to deliver a message, these two monopolized the horse market, without renting two horses, it will be difficult to deliver the letter.
True, there were some horses in his residence, but they were weak and suitable only for pulling carriages or carrying goods for short distances. If it were to go to Shaanxi, it would probably reach the heaven first.
Turning his back, Jing Qing gritted his teeth, He said, “Go to the treasury, take thirty taels! Depart immediately, no delays allowed!”
Feeling unwilling was only natural.
If it were an ordinary time, Jing Qing would never spend that much money. One horse for fifteen taels of silver, the round trip cost could buy two horses. But now, it’s not an ordinary time.
After ten days, the court will conduct a thorough investigation of the land and its sources. Once these orders are conveyed, and if he fails to handle matters beforehand, the losses incurred will be more than just the cost of two horses.
By this evening, it was nearly impossible to find a horse in the capital city. Eventually, the cost of renting a horse reached ten taels of silver per day, and even that couldn’t meet the demand. Some people resorted to using slow horses, while others rode donkeys to leave the city.
Informed of the developments at the court, some wealthy families began slamming tables, smashing chairs, and venting their anger for four hours before finally sitting down to write letters.
Endless streams of people rushed out of the city, their anxious expressions and hurried footsteps leaving the guards on the city walls puzzled. They occasionally glanced towards the direction of the imperial palace but heard no news of any significant events.
Xu Huizu patrolled the city defenses and ordered to delay closing the city gates for two hours. If people were desperate to leave the city, they should be allowed to do so. After all, every departing person, regardless of their intentions, was leaving to do something beneficial.
In the Grand Secretariat, aside from the three chief secretaries, Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, the Minister of Revenue, and Xia Yuanji, the Director of Agricultural Taxes office, were also present. In the middle of the room was the sand table previously used in the Fengtian hall.
Yu Xin gazed at the sand table, lost in thought, and asked Xia Yuanji, “Is land consolidation truly so severe?”
Xia Yuanji nodded slightly but shook his head, confusing Yu Xin and the others.
Before Yu Xin could inquire further, Xie Jin interjected, “Secretary Yu, land consolidation is indeed severe, but perhaps not as grave as His Majesty suggested. When His Majesty used the sand table to project the remaining taxed land after ten years, he only considered the reduction of the original taxed land and did not take into account the portion that would be swallowed up by the black areas. Many of these areas are subject to taxation, such as tax-exempt lands, which are not completely exempt but partially exempt.”
“As I projected, if we do not curb this problem now, in twenty years, the revenue from the South zhili region might not be sufficient to cover the officials’ salaries. In fifty years, the court will be plagued by financial issues, and in one hundred and fifty years, without reform, the Ming Dynasty might cease to exist!”
Upon hearing this, Xia Yuanji stood up and respectfully addressed Xie Jin, ” I have often heard that Senior Cabinet Minister Jie possesses keen insight and remarkable intelligence, and now, having the privilege to personally listen to him, it is truly extraordinary. As Senior Cabinet Minister Jie pointed out, although the Emperor intends to overlook the tax issues arising from the transformation of self-cultivating farmers into tenants, in the long run, his vision will undoubtedly become a reality! However, it may take time, not just ten years, but possibly a hundred years, or even one hundred and fifty years! If it takes any longer, I fear it will be difficult to sustain..”
Had Zhu Yunwen been here, he would surely admire these two individuals. It was precisely after one hundred and fifty years, during Zhang Juzheng’s reforms, that the Ming Dynasty was given a new lease of life.
Xie Jin chuckled and replied, “Vice Minister Xia is truly a remarkable talent. He can respond to questions about land area for each year without hesitation and calculates with utmost accuracy. His future prospects are limitless.”
Huang Zicheng withdrew his hand from touching the sand table and said to Xie Jin, “Vice Minister Xia is indeed a rare talent in the Ministry of Revenue. You must not try to recruit him to the Grand Secretariat.”
Upon hearing this, the others burst into laughter.
Zhang Dan stopped laughing and arranged, “Time is pressing. Minister Huang and Vice Minister Xia, please first draft a new salary plan. The rest of us will come up with measures to restrict land consolidation and strive to present them to his majesty within two days.”
“Very well,” Huang Zicheng and Xia Yuanji promptly agreed, and the two of them went to the table to begin formulating the new salary plan.
The distinctive characteristic of the Ming Dynasty’s salary system can be described in one word: meager!
The salaries were meager to the point of making one feel impoverished.
In the fourth year of Hongwu (1371), Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the Central Secretariat, Ministry of Revenue to determine the annual salaries of civil and military officials.
A First Rank official received 900 dan of grain per year, and a Second Rank official received 600 dan, and so on.
…
A Seventh Rank official received 80 dan, and a Ninth Rank official received 60 dan.
Although in the twenty-sixth year of Hongwu, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered a revision, changing the annual salary to a monthly salary, the increase compared to the fourth year of Hongwu was not significant. For instance, a First Rank official’s salary increased by 100 dan and a Ninth Rank official’s increased by 10 dan.
Let’s take the early Ming Dynasty as an example. As a Seventh Rank County Magistrate, the annual salary is 80 dan of grain. On average, it’s nearly 7 dan of grain per month, which is not bad—over 1,000 jin of grain per year.
The County Magistrate is in good health, married four wives, and has three sons and two daughters. His parents are still alive, and he has two servants. If we calculate like this, with over a dozen people to feed in a month, they still can’t consume that much grain, leaving over 900 catties.
They might take out 200 catties to exchange for some vegetables and tofu, leaving about 700 catties as surplus wealth?
No.
As the County Magistrate picks vegetable leaves from his teeth, someone knocks on the door.
When he opened the door and looked, he saw the officials from various departments, including the Six Bureaus, Granary Department, Horse Department, and others, who were busy with their duties of stationing, guarding, patrolling, urging for grain, and making arrests. They all lined up neatly and respectfully saluted, then extended their hands, saying, “County Lord, what about our grain for this month?”

Chapter 79: The Miserable Finances of Ming Dynasty
Officials(官吏), in fact, is a compound word combining “官” (guān) and “吏” (lì). Although these two words often appear together, fundamentally, they are entirely different.
During the Qin and Han dynasties, there was no distinction between “官” (guān) and “吏” (lì). “官” (guān) were “吏” (lì)., and “吏” (lì) were “官” (guān).
However, during the Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern dynasties, the line between “官” (guān) and “吏” (lì) was completely drawn.
“官” (guān) represented the upper class, the privileged, and those of high status, known as “The upper class has no ignoble lineage.”.
On the other hand, “吏” (lì) represented the lower class, the humble, those engaged in lowly occupations, known as “The lower class has no high noble background.”.
In the Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, “吏” (lì) essentially referred to a type of servant, also known as “胥吏” (xū lì:petty official). There was a saying:
“Guan(官) are like big fish, while Li(吏) are like small fish, The people who complete their grain duties are even drained and impoverished. Guan(官) are like tigers, while Li(吏) are like cats, they exploit and extract resources from the people..”
In the Ming Dynasty, government offices had “官” (guān), “僚” (liáo), and “吏” (lì).
Among them, “官” (guān) held the official position as the head; “僚” (liáo) were vice officials or assistants; and “吏” (lì) were clerks or staff members responsible for carrying out tasks.
“官” and “僚” were both officials with hierarchical positions, such as the “知县” (zhīxiàn: Magistrate) a Seventh rank official, “县丞” (xiàn chéng: Magistrate Assistant) An Eight rank official, and “主簿” (zhǔ bù: Clerk) a ninth rank official. Their appointments and dismissals came from the imperial court, and they received salaries from the court.
As for “吏” (lì), they do not have any official ranks and are considered “not part of the mainstream.” There is no concept of receiving imperial salaries from the court.
All their expenses for food and drinks come from the government office. If the government office’s finances have some surplus, it is distributed among these people. If the county magistrate dislikes someone, has a bad temper, or is corrupt, it is common for them to withhold the person’s wages for several months.
In later generations, people often talk about “bureaucratic rule” (官僚主义), but seldom mention “officialism” (官吏主义).
The reason is simple: “官僚” (guānliáo) refers to regular, officially appointed personnel, while “吏” (lì) are temporary employees and non-official personnel. Jobs such as officers, jailers, guards, coroners, grain officials, and security are menial tasks.
When they upset the county magistrate, they often call them “dog officials” directly.
The magistrate’s disdain for these individuals is not unfounded because they can only serve as clerks, both personally and for their descendants, without even qualifying for the imperial examinations. Their chances of transitioning from being non-appointed to appointed officials are virtually nonexistent.
As for these petty officials, the legitimate officials sneer at them, bossing them around and treating them harshly.
But here’s the problem.
No matter how much the magistrate looks down on the petty official, they still need these people to handle their affairs.
A single person cannot possibly stand guard, investigate corpses, catch criminals, and collect taxes, all at once.
Specialized individuals are required for these tasks, and these petty officials are responsible for handling miscellaneous duties.
These petty officials, relying on their own expertise, handle tasks for the government office, even though they don’t have official positions, they still need to make a living.
Where does the money come from?
It comes from the government office.
And where does the government office’s money come from?
The imperial court provides it.
How much does the imperial court provide?
Ah, seven dan of rice per month.
The magistrate looked back at the rice jar, which still had around seven hundred catties of rice left. “Why don’t you thirty-something petty officials take it and divide it among yourselves?”
The petty officials carried the sacks, each weighing around twenty catties, with tears in their eyes as they returned home. Their children cried out of hunger, their wives demanded to return to their parent’s homes, and their fathers sighed at the sight of such a small amount of rice. Finally, they decided not to eat that day.
Can a whole family survive with only twenty catties of rice per month?
As a result, the petty officials gathered together, preparing to impose additional taxes this year, going from house to house to collect them. The official disagreed? Until then the official would take the lion’s share, and we would get the leftovers. Why shouldn’t they agree?
Besides, officials come and go like flowing water; they leave their positions after just three years. But we, the petty officials, are destined to stay here for generations. How can we afford to starve to death?
It is precisely because of this that the harm caused by petty officials during the Ming Dynasty is so severe. Corruption is rampant, no matter how many heads Zhu Yuanzhang cut off, there are still people who are corrupt.
Without corruption, they cannot survive!
You, Old Zhu always cares your own sons, with the kings receiving tens of thousands of dan in salary. But what about us?
With only seventy to eighty stones of rice for dozens of families, how are we supposed to survive?
If we don’t become corrupt, we become beggars, and our whole family will be beggars. Some of our children might even starve to death.
But if we are corrupt, we can survive, our children can survive, the petty officials can survive.
What choice do we have?
We can only exploit the common people, engage in corruption and bribery, as we have no other options!
The meager salary system has significant flaws. If these flaws are not addressed, it will be impossible to fundamentally weaken and control the corruption of officials.
After all, being an official is not just about living a good life for oneself but also supporting parents, spouse, and children.
Now, the court wants to implement a Single Whip method while also seizing land and restraining land consolidation. This directly targets both officials and the petty officials, making it difficult for them to take advantage anymore.
There is no way to come up with clever excuses anymore, and they can’t easily exploit the labor of the common people.
If they can’t exploit the common people, then they lose their source of income. Without that income, these petty officials will either starve to death or have no choice but to return home and become farmers.
To stabilize the court, to calm the hearts of officials, and to successfully implement the single whip method and restrain land consolidation, it is necessary to improve the meager salary system and consider the livelihoods of the petty officials.
Huang Zicheng and Xia Yuanji spent only one night and devised a new salary system based on the Hongwu 20th-year salary as a blueprint, with an increase of nearly 50% overall.
The monthly salary for a first-ranked official was raised from 87 dans to 130 dans… The seventh-ranked official’s monthly salary was increased from 7 stones and 5 dou to 12 dan… The ninth-ranked official’s monthly salary was increased from 5 dans to 7 dans and 5 dou.
As for the government office’s petty officials, except for the scribes who enjoyed the ninth-ranked treatment, others received monthly salaries ranging from 7 stones to 5 stones.
The new salary system was not a simple 50% increase, but it also considered the state’s tax revenue, the total expenditure of officials’ salaries by the court, and the living conditions of the petty official.
After being reviewed by the Grand Secretariat, it was unanimously considered appropriate, and Huang Zicheng and Xia Yuanji submitted it to the Wuying Hall.
Upon seeing the new salary system, Zhu Yunwen frowned and asked, “Is 5 dans enough for the petty officials’ daily expenses?”
Xia Yuanji bowed and said, “Your Majesty, 5 dan of income is not only sufficient but also leaves a surplus. Converted into silver, their annual salary could amount to thirty taels, which is comparable to the income of ninth-ranked officials in previous years.”
Zhu Yunwen calculated and agreed with Xia Yuanji’s statement. He then asked Huang Zicheng, “With the inclusion of the petty officials in the official salary, how much does it increase? Can the Ministry of Revenue sustain it?”
Huang Zicheng’s expression turned somewhat bitter as he replied, “Your Majesty, the number of petty officials is far greater than that of court officials. Currently, there are only about 30,000 civil and military officials in the court, while the Ming Dynasty has 1,427 government offices. Some have as few as 30 employees, and others have up to a hundred. If we average it at fifty people per office, it would amount to over 70,000 petty officials. The previous official salaries were 4.5 million dans. If we add the petty officials, an additional 4.2 million stones will be needed, making it at least 9 million stones in total, solely for annual salaries.”
Nine million stones!
In previous years, the total agricultural tax revenue of the court was only 32.79 million dan!
Apart from salaries for officials, the court needed to provide salaries for the royal family, which would also amount to over one million dans per year.
This would mean that more than one-third of the court’s financial resources would be used for paying salaries.
Every year, the Ministry of War needs to take away 3 million dan of grain, and this is only under the present system where garrisons do not require much food supply from the court. However, with the promotion of the New Army Policy and the research on new military tactics, the expenses of the Ministry of War will increase exponentially, estimated at around eight million stones.
After deducting the expenses for the royal family, officials’ salaries, and military expenses, an additional three million dan were needed to maintain the canal transportation, one million dan for relief purposes, and other miscellaneous expenses, such as rewards, expenses for the harem, shipbuilding, palace construction, and tomb construction, which would also require at least five to six million stones.
By the end of the year, the central treasury might have around four million stones left.
However, if a war was to be fought and an army of 300,000 soldiers was mobilized, which would take about four months, nearly 800,000 dan of grain and fodder would be required. Moreover, three times as many civilian laborers would be needed for transportation, and they also needed to be fed…
After a battle is fought, upon reviewing the financial records, alas, there’s no money left. Perhaps they might even need to borrow money.
But where would they borrow money from?
The monthly salaries of court officials haven’t been paid yet.
Deduct it then…
This was the miserable financial situation of the Ming Dynasty, to the extent that in history, there were ridiculous incidents where salary payments were made using ingredients like Sichuan peppercorns and star anise…

Chapter 80: Promoting the “Top 100 Counties and Top 10 Prefectures”
The government’s lack of funds is a key reason for the problem, and it is mainly due to excessively low taxation.
Zhu Yuanzhang, coming from a peasant background, believed that lower agricultural taxes were better. As a result, he implemented the “1/30 tax” policy, which kept the Ming Dynasty’s tax revenue from surpassing 33 million dan of grain.
What’s even more regrettable is that in the history of the Ming Dynasty, during the reigns of Emperor Hongwu, Jianwen, and Yongle, the imperial court was considered at its wealthiest. However, as time went on, the financial situation of the court worsened. By the Tianqi reign, the annual tax revenue had shrunk to 25.79 million dan of grain.
It can be said that the Ming Dynasty reached its peak at the beginning and gradually declined afterward. Unfortunately, the Ming emperors lacked an understanding of economics and were hesitant to reform the tax system.
Zhang Juzheng was a capable figure who brought a glimmer of hope to the Ming Dynasty through a series of reforms. However, Emperor Wanli did not understand Zhang Juzheng’s ideas and was ignorant of economics. After Zhang Juzheng’s death, that glimmer of hope was completely extinguished.
Zhu Yuanzhang oversimplified economic issues and lacked research into social relationships and activities.
Zhu Yunwen had no intention of following in Zhu Yuanzhang’s footsteps. Not only did he increase the agricultural tax from “1/30” to “1/15” but he also abolished the official lands, tax-exempt fields and made all land subject to taxation.
Although including the petty officials into the imperial court’s salary system would incur significant expenses, compared to the heavy damage they inflicted on the common people and the tax exempt land they held, such a move was absolutely correct and feasible.
Xia Yuanji reported, “Your Majesty, if the Single Whip method and the measures to control land consolidation are fully implemented, this year’s tax revenue will be at least 50 million dan of grain, and it is highly likely to reach 60 million dan of grain. At present, we only need to endure for half a year, and the Ministry of Revenue will still have an abundant reserve after deducting various expenditures.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said contentedly, “The salary arrangements seem acceptable to me, but I have a proposal.”
“Please, Your Majesty, share your thoughts.”
Xia Yuanji said respectfully.
Pointing to the documents on the new salary system, Zhu Yunwen said, “Considering the thirteen provinces, three hundreds of prefectures, and over one thousand counties, let us also take the Ministry of Personnel into account. We shall use tax revenue, population, commerce, land, official reputation, public security, and criminal justice as criteria for assessment. Every two years, we will conduct evaluations of the prefectures and counties and select the Top 100 Counties and the Top 10 Prefectures.”
“For the Top 100 Counties and the Top 10 Prefectures, all officials will receive an additional 50% salary increase within two years. After two years, if they still qualify for the list, they will continue to enjoy the salary increase. If they drop out of the Top 100 or Top 10, the additional salary increase will be canceled. How about this plan?”
Xia Yuanji looked surprised and quickly replied, “This measure, which benefits the country and the people, should be implemented for eternity!”
Huang Zicheng sighed and said, “Your Majesty’s governance is wise, we cannot compare.”
Using salary increases as an incentive to select the Top 100 Counties and the Top 10 Prefectures would undoubtedly prompt all prefectures and counties to pay more attention to the well-being of the people. Even the unruly petty officials would behave, treating the elderly farmers with respect and politeness.
Who wouldn’t want to engage in something that directly affects their own interests?
Even if there were a few unscrupulous individuals, they would be abandoned by the collective of officials. One person’s actions couldn’t jeopardize the financial gains of everyone in the government office.
After Huang Zicheng and Xia Yuanji left, the Grand Secretariat Yu Xin and the Minister of Personnel Qi Tai were summoned to the Wuying Hall.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen asked the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of Personnel to reorganize the prefectures and counties and notify all regional governments to regulate the number of petty officials before the implementation of the new salary system. They should reduce the number of petty officials and retain those who couldn’t be reduced.
In summary, exceeding the prescribed quotas and overstaffing will not be allowed. If any prefectures or counties have special circumstances, they can report to the court for separate approval.
After dealing with a series of affairs, it was approaching evening. Instead of going directly to the Kunning Palace, Zhu Yunwen went to the Jingren Palace.
Luo Yan’er was sitting there writing, but when she heard movement, she looked up and saw Emperor Zhu Yunwen. She quickly put down her brush and stood up to salute, saying, “I greet Your Majesty.”
Zhu Yunwen extended his hand and smiled, saying, “No need for formalities. How are you feeling today?”
“Thank you, Your Majesty, for your concern. I am much better now,” Luo Yan’er replied with a smile.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly, walked to the desk, and looked at the words on the paper. He read, “As women possess quiet and virtuous qualities, they should not seek to be talkative, as excessive talking leads to mistakes. It is better to be reticent. Therefore, in the ‘Book of Documents,’ there are admonitions against the crowing of hens in the morning. In the ‘Book of Songs’, includes a critique of the dangerous stairs. The ‘Book of Rites’ emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to the rules and rituals. Those who are good at self-discipline should be cautious in these matters, and this is indeed reasonable advice. What do you think of this ‘Inner Teachings’?”
Luo Yan’er walked to the side, respectfully replying, “The ‘Inner Teachings’ contain profound wisdom.”
“Profound wisdom? Hehe, is it really so?” Zhu Yunwen said with a smile as he looked at Luo Yan’er.
Luo Yan’er didn’t dare to meet Zhu Yunwen’s gaze directly, and she lowered her head, saying, “If I talk too much and provoke Your Majesty’s anger and punishment, then isn’t the ‘Inner Teachings’ truly wise?”
Zhu Yunwen was momentarily taken aback, then burst into laughter.
This Lady Luo really had some talent.
“In my opinion, these words should be burned.”
Zhu Yunwen picked up the paper and walked to the fireplace, throwing it in. He turned back to look at the surprised Luo Yan’er and said, “Speaking too much leads to mistakes only because there was no prior contemplation. If you have reason, moderation, and evidence, you can speak thousands of words without any harm.”
Luo Yan’er looked at the paper turning into ashes, and her eyes slightly flickered as they met Zhu Yunwen’s clear and profound gaze.
Something seemed to stir her tender heart.
He might be an emperor, but he appeared to be different from what she had imagined.
There was no domineering aura, no absolute dominance that could determine life and death with a single word. Instead, he possessed an elegant Confucian manner like a gentle spring breeze and the heroic charm she had once dreamed of. He treated people with kindness and approachability, seemingly seeing everyone as equals.
Entranced by the profound depths of his gaze, a moment of heart palpitation jolted Luo Yan’er back to reality. She quickly turned her head away, stealing two more glances at Zhu Yunwen. In a hushed voice, she replied, “What Your Majesty said is true.”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curved into a smile as he nodded slightly, asking, “Shall we go and visit Chengqian Palace?”
Luo Yan’er readily agreed.
In Chengqian Palace, the sound of weaving machines filled the air.
The poisoning incident from before had not affected the production in Chengqian Palace. Consort Xian was inspecting the finished medical gauze, and after confirming its quality, she had it sent for high-temperature treatment.
Although Zhu Yunwen had repeatedly ordered that he didn’t require formalities when visiting Chengqian Palace, Consort Xian and the palace maids had never followed his instruction. They still paid their respects, and after doing so, the sound of weaving resumed.
“Your Majesty, currently Chengqian Palace can produce sixty boxes of gauze daily. If we can purchase more weaving machines and increase the workforce, producing a hundred boxes daily would be no problem,” Consort Xian said with a smile.
Zhu Yunwen inspected the medical gauze and asked, “Are there any issues?”
Consort Xian shook her head and replied, “There are no issues. The two kings, the King of Liao and King of Min, have found reliable cotton suppliers. As long as the supply of cotton remains stable, there won’t be any problems with the production of medical gauze.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled contentedly and said, “A daily production of a hundred boxes is a commendable goal. However, I’m worried that the Empress won’t agree.”
In the Kunning Palace.
Ma Enhui moved the abacus beads, recorded the numbers with a pen, moved the beads again, and finally looked at the figures on the paper with a frown. She said to the attendant, “The Ministry of War needs to purchase three hundred thousand boxes, but our daily production is only sixty boxes, a year only twenty thousand boxes. At this rate, it will take fifteen years, won’t it?”
Fifteen years is too long! This Empress must seize the day and night!
Ma Enhui gave a stern order, “Go and tell the two kings. I want at least a hundred weaving machines as soon as possible. Additionally, let Consort Ning take charge and select three hundred palace maids to participate in the weaving process. I want to fulfill the contract with the Ministry of War of three hundred thousand boxes within two years!”

Chapter 81: The Stingy Empress…
Ma Enhui may not understand what capitalism is, but she knows that the more contract quotas she can fulfill in the shortest time, the more money will flow into her hands.
They need a daily production of no less than four hundred boxes to complete three hundred thousand in two years.
But currently, they can only produce sixty, which is far from enough.
When Zhu Yunwen entered the Kunning Palace, Ma Enhui had already sent several groups of maids in succession. It seemed that the empress intended to vacate the Jingyang Palace, Yonghe Palace, and Yanxi Palace to establish textile factories.
It is not known whether the empress did this intentionally, but she did not utilize the spacious areas of the various departments and treasuries in the inner palace. Instead, she continued to encroach upon her own Eastern Six Palaces.
With this trend, it seems impossible to fill the Eastern and Western Twelve Palaces with concubines…
Capital, indeed, is something that makes people both love and hate it.
“Your Majesty, I am contemplating how to expand production, but the manpower in the harem is insufficient. What should I do?” Ma Enhui asked after bowing to Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen held Ma Enhui’s hand, sat down, and replied, “If there’s a shortage, you can transfer some people from the Arts Troupe. As Murong Jing’er mentioned, the Arts Troupe is large and difficult to manage, not good at handling matters.”
Ma Enhui pouted slightly and tugged at Zhu Yunwen’s arm, saying, “With Your Majesty’s support, I can be at ease. Your Majesty, the Arts Troupe is highly profitable. It won’t be long before it surpasses the wealth of the Kunning Palace.”
Zhu Yunwen secretly took a deep breath, sensing something amiss in her words.
Could it be that the empress is jealous of the Arts Troupe?
It’s not surprising since ever since the Lantern Festival, the Arts Troupe has transformed into a fully commercialized operation.
Whether you are a royal relative, high-ranking official, low-ranking official, or a wealthy merchant in the capital, their performances are priced uniformly at 500 taels of silver for a two-hour show.
It’s said that their bookings are already full until May, with a minimum of two performances daily, earning over a thousand taels of silver per day. During this period, their total earnings have exceeded ten thousand taels.
As an organization within the inner palace, the Arts Troupe is technically exempt from taxes. However, Zhu Yunwen not only demanded them to pay taxes but imposed a heavy tax rate of 1/15.
The Ministry of Revenue naturally welcomed this decision, as the Performing Arts Troupe belonged to Zhu Yunwen, and he set the 1/15 tax rate, so no one could complain. With over a thousand taels of tax revenue from the Arts Troupe each month, it is more than enough to support the livelihoods of over thirty petty officials in a county office for a whole year. Why wouldn’t they be pleased?
Within the harem, the Arts Troupe is also unique.
Though Ma Enhui is the Empress of the Great Ming, she cannot easily intervene in the affairs of the Arts Troupe.
The Arts Troupe was previously known as the Music Office, but Zhu Yunwen abolished it, leaving behind a group of people with nowhere to go. He reorganized them into the Arts Troupe and appointed Murong Jing’er as its head to oversee its affairs.
Regarding the commercial operation of the Arts Troupe, Zhu Yunwen gave a decree entrusting Murong Jing’er with full authority.
In other words, the Arts Troupe managed by Murong Jing’er, although officially under Ma Enhui’s supervision, is practically highly independent. All matters, including personnel, finances, programs, and performance arrangements, are entirely decided by the Arts Troupe itself.
Initially, Ma Enhui didn’t mind because a single performance by the troupe cost five hundred taels, and how many in the capital could afford such a price? Who would waste so much money on a mere two-hour show?
However, Ma Enhui underestimated the enthusiasm of the people in the capital. Not to mention the kings like the King of Liao and the King of Min who enjoyed the performances, even other officials and wealthy merchants in the capital liked to watch the brilliance of the Arts Troupe.
After all, the troupe performed for the Emperor and the Empress, and we had the opportunity to experience royal treatment, who wouldn’t mind spending some money?
As for the five hundred taels of silver, yes, it was expensive, and only big households could afford it. For smaller households like ours, it was better to keep a low profile, gather a few officials, each contributing seventy to eighty taels, and form a group to attend the performance.
Ma Enhui felt unhappy; while the Arts Troupe needed to organize only one to two hundred people for a show and earned tens of thousands of taels in just half a month, she, on the other hand, had to mobilize hundreds of people, spend countless materials and efforts, working day and night. Even then, she could only earn a few thousand taels a month from selling medicinal gauze.
Comparing the two, Ma Enhui felt defeated, and what made her more upset was that the money the Arts Troupe earn was not her own…
Just as Zhu Yunwen was about to console Ma Enhui with words about employment and social value, a palace maid entered and announced that Murong Jing’er requested an audience with the Empress.
Ma Enhui gave Zhu Yunwen a deep look and asked, “I wonder why she’s coming.”
Zhu Yunwen stood up, smiling, and said, “Since she’s looking for the Empress, I will excuse myself for now and see what she has to say.”
Ma Enhui chuckled; how could the Emperor hide and eavesdrop?
Zhu Yunwen paid no attention to it and went behind the screen, took a chair, and began to doze off.
The Single Whip method, the reorganization of officials, and the restraint of land consolidation all harmed the interests of the gentry group. While it could be managed with officials in the capital, what about in the local areas?
How would those gentry groups, the so-called landlords, react?
Would they resist the court?
He wondered if they had the courage, or were the shadows of the massacres during the Hongwu era, imprinted deep in their bones.
Rebellion?
Unlikely; the gentry groups had only a few thugs at their disposal, not enough for a rebellion.
Without widespread participation from farmers, most rebellions wouldn’t amount to anything.
By advocating for the welfare of farmers, there shouldn’t be a reason for them to oppose him.
With this approach, the gentry would have no choice but to compromise.
Once the issue of the livelihood of officials and petty officials were resolved through salaries and allowances, the Single Whip method could be fully implemented.
The reason why Zhang Juzheng’s reform was like a fleeting flower that lasted for ten years is primarily because the reform harmed the interests of officials, failed to gain their understanding and support, and lacked supervision and correction in the implementation process, leading to serious deviations in many reform initiatives.
Compared to Zhang Juzheng, he have greater advantages. The first advantage is that he is the Emperor, while Zhang Juzheng can only be considered the Grand Secretary’s “Emperor”.
Another advantage was his understanding of the problems with the Single Whip method and land consolidation. He had taken various safeguards and implemented reform 2.0, which should be an improvement over the previous 1.0 version.
Moreover, Zhang Juzheng’s reform lasted for ten years before he died. In contrast, he was only in his early twenties this year, so as long as he didn’t indulge himself or seek immortality, living to sixty or seventy should be no problem. With thirty years ahead of him, he was confident that he could tackle the land and governance issues at the grassroots level.
Just as Zhu Yunwen was feeling drowsy, the conversation outside the screen brought him back to alert.
After Murong Jing’er paid her respects to Ma Enhui, she presented a ledger and respectfully handed it to the Empress, saying, “Empress, this is the Arts Troupe’s accounting book for the first month. After deducting taxes, the balance is fourteen thousand taels. All the silver has been sealed and sent outside the Kunning Palace’s gate. Please verify it, Your Majesty.”
“What?!” Ma Enhui looked at Murong Jing’er with surprise. She had not expected Murong Jing’er to keep the slightest bit of money, and completely handed it over to herself.
“Your Majesty’s words are absolute. The Arts Troupe can independently manage its revenue and doesn’t need to submit it to the Kunning Palace,” Ma Enhui said, suppressing her puzzlement.
Murong Jing’er smiled lightly and replied, “Empress, the Arts Troupe is here following orders. The stability of the two thousand six hundred members of the troupe is all thanks to the grace of His Majesty and the Empress. Both the upper and lower ranks of the troupe are willing to hand over all the revenue to the Empress for disposal.”
Ma Enhui felt her face heat up. She realized she had been too petty, acting like a small-minded person and making unwarranted speculations. With a faint smile, she said, “In that case, I will manage it on behalf of His Majesty.”

Chapter 82: The Original Accumulation of the Central Bank.
When Zhu Yunwen emerged from behind the screen, Ma Enhui was standing next to the chest, holding five silver ingots in her hands. Her eyes were slightly narrowed, and she occasionally exuded a gleam of anticipation.
“Empress…” Zhu Yunwen called softly.
Ma Enhui turned to look at him, smiling brightly as she said, “Your Majesty, look here. There are nine thousand eight hundred taels of silver, and with the initial payment of three thousand taels for medicinal gauze, we now have a surplus of ten thousand eight hundred taels. The Central Bank finally has some money reserved for future use.”
Zhu Yunwen watched Ma Enhui putting the silver back into the chest. He knew that though she had a penchant for wealth, her fondness was not driven by personal greed but rather by the desire to make the harem financially independent and no longer rely on the state treasury.
Murong Jing’er was a clever person who knew who the real master of the harem was.
If the revenue of the Arts Troupe were just small profits, it would be fine to leave some for daily expenses. But now, the revenue was too significant, to the extent that it became a troublesome issue. That’s why Murong Jing’er proactively handed over all the revenue to the Empress for disposal.
Ma Enhui was pleased with Murong Jing’er’s decision. She kept seventy percent and allowed Murong Jing’er to take the remaining thirty percent back.
“It’s just over ten thousand taels, which is not enough to support the Central Bank. Recently, the King of Liao and the King of Min discussed the problem of depreciating paper currency and the high value of silver and copper. The treasury note system has encountered significant issues, and I need the Central Bank to have more money to implement currency reform,” Zhu Yunwen whispered to Ma Enhui as he closed the chest.
Ma Enhui called for a eunuch to carry the silver to a nearby temporary warehouse and said to Zhu Yunwen, “I also know about the problem of depreciating paper currency and the high value of silver. I have heard that copper is even more expensive. In the past, one tael of silver could be exchanged for one thousand wén of copper coins, but now it can only be exchanged for eight hundred or seven hundred wén. I wonder where went wrong.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled lightly and replied, “Scarcity makes things valuable. When copper becomes scarce, it naturally becomes more valuable.”
In Chinese culture, copper holds a special significance. Ancient people believed that the color of copper symbolized nobility. Looking at the ancient tripod vessels used in sacrifices, the most revered ones were not made of jade or gold, but rather of copper.
Before the Han Dynasty, and even tracing back to the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, many ancient texts that mentioned “gold” actually referred to “copper.”
For example, the Book of Documents records: “The people of Yin moved their capital eight times before and five times after.” This means that the early Shang Dynasty relocated its capital eight times, while the later Shang Dynasty moved it five times, which meant they changed their residence every few decades, and it wasn’t because the property rights expired after seventy years.
Many historians believe that the frequent capital relocations during the Shang Dynasty were due to reasons such as avoiding floods, power struggles for the throne, and the nomadic lifestyle. However, some also think that the primary reason for these relocations was to search for sources of copper mines.
The brilliant Bronze Age culture was supported by copper mines. Since copper was scarce and valuable, it was suitable to be used as official currency. After all, ordinary people couldn’t produce or imitate it in a blacksmith shop.
During the Tang Dynasty, there were not many copper mines, mainly in the counties of Yian and Yongxing in Xuānzhōu, Longyou, and Jiangxi South Province.
In the Song Dynasty, copper mines were mainly distributed in the three provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. Four major copper mining sites emerged: Censhui in Shaoshan Prefecture, Yongxing in Tanzhou Prefecture, Qianshan in Xinzhou Prefecture, and Xingli in Raozhou Prefecture.
However, by the time of the Yuan Dynasty, the number of copper mines decreased significantly. During the Yuan Dynasty, paper currency was prevalent, and gold, silver, and copper took a back seat. A small amount of copper mining was enough for the imperial court and nobles to make wine cups.
After Zhu Yuanzhang took over from the Yuan Dynasty, there were only two copper mines left in Dexing and Qianshan in Jiangxi. The economic system relied on the use of money, but there was not enough copper. Later, the introduction of paper currency also didn’t go well, resulting in a situation where both paper currency and copper coins were in circulation.
By the time of Zhu Yunwen’s reign, the Ming Dynasty had an even greater demand for copper, but copper production couldn’t keep up. Naturally, the exchange rate between silver and copper would become imbalanced.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the map of the Ming Empire and set his eyes on Raozhou Prefecture in Jiangxi.
In later generations, this place would become a super copper mining base, with “six mines and two smelters,” and its copper abundance would surpass that of the entire country. If he arranged for people to start mining copper in Dongxiang and Yongping in advance and expanded the mining scale in Dexing, there shouldn’t be any objections.
After all, everyone was a descendant of Huaxia, sharing the same heritage…
Besides Jiangxi, there were also rich copper mines in Yunnan, Gansu, Anhui, and other places.
However, Yunnan was currently in turmoil with too many elephants and ivory not being valuable. There were also many unruly people, so it might be better to wait for a while before starting mining.
Gansu was too far away and occasionally faced threats from the Mongols. They couldn’t dig copper mines today and find them taken away tomorrow, wasting their efforts.
It seemed that he could only mark the copper mines in Jiangxi and Anhui, which were scattered in the later generations, and send people to mine them.
“Your Majesty, Your Highness, King of Liao, and King of Min are requesting an audience,” Shuangxi came in to announce.
“Let them in,” Zhu Yunwen said while looking at the map.
King of Liao and King of Min arrived with quite a commotion. A group of eunuchs carried over twenty redwood boxes into the courtyard and placed two of them inside the room.
“Empress, it seems we can afford to add some extra dishes to the Royal Kitchen tonight,” Zhu Yunwen chuckled at the sight.
Ma Enhui glanced at Zhu Yunwen but remained silent, trying to maintain her composure.
After the two kings paid their respects, Zhu Zhi, with a smile on his face, presented a ledger, saying, “Your Majesty, horses are scarce in the capital these days, and the income has been abundant these past two days. This silver belongs to the palace, and here is the ledger.”
Zhu Yunwen didn’t bother examining the details and flipped to the end, where he was astonished to find a balance of fifty-eight thousand taels. He couldn’t help but ask, “you sold the horses for golds?”
“Your Majesty, with so many people leaving the city urgently and delivering messages, the price of a horse has risen to one hundred taels. Even if we rent ordinary horses, it costs two or three taels per day. It’s highly profitable now,” Zhu Zhi sighed.
The Emperor had informed them in advance about the scarcity of horses in the capital. So Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng invested several thousand taels, mobilizing all their subordinates to gather most of the scattered horses in the capital, renting them out at double the usual price. To prevent any disputes and ensure fairness, they even signed contracts.
Now, those people wanted to break the contracts and take back the horses, but the two kings had already rented them out, and there was nothing they could do.
Zhu Yunwen acted like a skillful trader, using the horse situation as a tool to extract wealth from officials and the wealthy.
“Have you paid taxes on all this?” Zhu Yunwen pointed to the ledger and asked.
Zhu Geng looked somewhat dejected and said with a hint of grievance, “Your Majesty, we have paid taxes, nearly four thousand taels. A tax rate of 1/15 is a bit too heavy.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and smiled, “A tax rate of 1/15, is it not profitable?”
Zhu Geng was left speechless.
Zhu Yunwen continued, “In my opinion, a tax rate of 1/15 is still light. Even if it were 1/10, you would still make a great profit. As long as there’s profit, your livelihood won’t be affected. Besides, the tax revenue of nearly four thousand taels will be deposited into the national treasury. This money will be used to pay officials’ salaries and soldiers’ rations. As kings, it’s your contribution to the country. Shouldn’t you be content with that?”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng hurriedly shook their heads, who dares to complaints.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and asked, “Has Uncle Yan approached you?”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng nodded repeatedly.
Zhu Zhi said, “Your Majesty, it seems King of Yan is interested in engaging in business.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily, took out a book titled “New Army Policies” from the desk, and placed it in the box containing the silver. He said to the two kings, “Send these two boxes of silver to King of Yan’s residence. He will understand my intentions.”

Chapter 83: The Rumor reaches Luling
Jiangxi, Luling.
County Magistrate Lin Tai was flipping through “The Analects of Confucius” in the back hall of the county office, occasionally reciting a line, “When you see someone virtuous, think of becoming their equal; when you see someone unvirtuous, introspect.” He would then lower his head, appearing lost in thought.
The Chief Clerk, Song Baogui, hurriedly entered the back hall and exclaimed loudly, “Magistrate, Magistrate, a letter from the capital!”
Upon hearing this, Lin Tai quickly stood up and walked out of the room.
Song Baogui also approached, handing over the letter with a fawning smile, “Magistrate, take a look.”
Lin Tai took the letter and carefully read it. He smiled and said, “It’s a letter from Wang Tan, Brother Wang from the office of Scrutiny for War. It has been about three months since we last received correspondence, so this must be a letter to catch up on old times.”
Song Baogui concurred, “Even if it’s catching up, it probably includes some news from the capital as well. Magistrate, can you share some of the news with us, so we can broaden our horizons and stay informed.”
Having spent many years secluded in Luling, Song Baogui was eager to hear news from the capital.
Lin Tai knew Song Baogui’s intentions and didn’t hide anything. He unfolded the letter and read it carefully. After glancing up and down a few times, his expression changed, and he held the letter with trembling hands.
Noticing Lin Tai’s reaction, Song Baogui was experienced enough to understand that something significant had happened.
“Magistrate?”
Song Baogui called softly after Lin Tai finished reading the letter.
Lin Tai shook as he raised and lowered his body, his face turning pale. He spoke with a heavy voice, “This… this goes against ancestral norms! Quick, go fetch uncle Fu!”
Song Baogui was perplexed.
Goes against ancestral norms?
Is he referring to the emperor?
Then why summon uncle Fu?
He’s just the house steward. Shouldn’t he be calling the vice magistrate and me?
“Go!”
Seeing Song Baogui’s hesitation, Lin Tai shouted again.
With no other option, Song Baogui left the county office. As he looked at the rushing waters of the Gan River not far away, he sighed, crossed Xixi Bridge, and headed along the embankment to find uncle Fu.
It was almost spring equinox, and at this time, uncle Fu should be overseeing the good farmland that County Magistrate Lin had purchased.
Indeed, uncle Fu stood at the edge of the field, loudly directing dozens of tenant farmers with waves of his whip. If the fields weren’t muddy, he might have charged forward to strike someone by now.
Seeing Song Baogui, Uncle Fu knew that he had been summoned by Magistrate Lin and shouted to the farmers in the field, “If the work isn’t done properly today, none of you will get any food! Starve to death, you bunch of mud-legged peasants!”
“Chief Clerk, does the Magistrate have something urgent to discuss?”
Uncle Fu asked.
Song Baogui shook his head and replied, “The Magistrate seems very anxious. Let’s hurry back.”
By the time Song Baogui and Fubo returned to the county office, Lin Tai looked extremely worn out and uneasy. Without waiting for Uncle Fu’s inquiry, Lin Tai let out a long sigh and said, “Return all the newly acquired land along the riverbank.”
“Return?”
Uncle Fu was taken aback.
Return to whom?
Why should they return it? These lands were robbed through their own efforts. Why should they return them?
Could it be that someone reported to the prefect?
Impossible. These people were well acquainted with their situation. A group of mud-legged peasants who didn’t even know how to read, it would be strange if they went to lodge a complaint.
“Magistrate must be joking, haha. Are you hungry? I’ll have someone prepare something immediately.”
Uncle Fu forced a laugh, feeling uneasy.
With a darkened expression, Lin Tai shouted, “I told you to return all the fields! Whichever family’s fields they are, return them to that family! Renew the land deeds properly, and make sure they all get them back. If you can’t return them, then you better go back to your hometown!”
“Ah?”
Uncle Fu couldn’t believe it, what is this?
Making oneself give up the land and insisting that those commoners take it back?
“Magistrate, we used silver to buy these pieces of land. This…”
Uncle Fu was extremely reluctant.
Lin Tai turned around, picked up the teapot, and smashed it directly on the ground, shouting, “I am the head of the family, and you are the steward! Can’t you understand my words, or are they not effective anymore?!”
Uncle Fu trembled and quickly knelt down to beg for forgiveness. As Lin Tai urged him again, he hurriedly fetched the land deeds and ran toward the riverbank.
What on earth is happening here?
Returning all these fields to their previous owners for nothing? On what grounds?
Uncle Fu couldn’t make sense of it.
Chief Clerk Song Baogui seemed to sense something. Lin Tai sighed and handed the letter to Song Baogui, saying, “In consideration of your concern for me, take a look at this letter.”
After expressing his gratitude, Song Baogui took the letter and, as soon as he read it, he exclaimed in shock, “The court is actually demanding the assessment of land, tracing its origins? If the origins are questionable, not only do they want the land returned, but also compensation in silver?”
In this day and age, which official with some level of status doesn’t have a few acres of unclean land?
Are all the officials in the capital pure and untainted?
Perhaps not!
Although they might not be buying land in the capital, they would definitely be acquiring land in their hometowns. It’s said that some second-ranked officials have claimed up to thirty percent of a prefecture’s land as their own.
How could these officials allow such an absurd decree to pass?
Lin Tai sighed mournfully and said, “Wang Tan wouldn’t deceive me. Although the exact reasons are unclear, it’s probably related to the Single Whip method. The court is about to implement a major reform. With this, how are we supposed to survive?”
Song Baogui held the letter, feeling uneasy. “It also mentions here that the Internal Ministry and the Ministry of Personnel are preparing new salary regulations, seemingly intending to include petty officials. Is that even possible?”
Lin Tai frowned and remained silent.
The number of petty officials far exceeded that of bureaucrats.
If the court included petty officials in the salary system, it would likely result in a huge financial burden and potentially undermine the stability of the empire.
Lin Tai sighed again and said, “The prominent officials in the court, why can’t they see the potential harm in this? They let the emperor act like this. In less than a year, the burden of taxes on the people will surely increase again. At that time, there might be great turmoil.”
Song Baogui squinted his eyes and didn’t respond, lost in thought.
Taking land from officials and wealthy elites, taxing it heavily, and implementing the single whip method might indeed reshape the empire’s finances. Even if petty officials were included, there should still be enough surplus.
Great turmoil?
What kind of turmoil?
The “Single Whip method” implemented in Luling was not directly applying the 1/15 tax to farmers. Instead, officials from the county’s agricultural tax office gathered all the farmers and inquired about their harvests and tax payments from the previous year, as well as various types of taxes paid.
They calculated an account for the farmers and informed them that although the tax rate used to be 1/30, the actual taxes imposed had exceeded 1/15, and sometimes even 1/7.
Now, with the new policy from the court, there will only be a 1/15 tax in the future, and no one will come to your homes demanding additional taxes.
What?
Corvée labor for repairing the riverbank?
No more corvée, only conscription.
In the future, if the court needed to repair the riverbank, they would pay 50 wén per day. If they needed labor for riverbank repair, they could come and work for extra income. If they didn’t want to come, they could stay at home and sleep; no one would force them to become laborers.
Even if they were conscripted to transport grain or row boats, they would receive wages; they wouldn’t be working for free.
Now the Single Whip method was widely welcomed among the farmers. People from the county agriculture tax office would visit the fields every day, saying, “If you encounter difficulties, come to our agriculture tax office.”
People who didn’t know might think that the county office had relocated.
Lin Tai had no choice. The people from the Provincial administration office were sitting in the agriculture tax office. What could he do?
If, as stated in the letter, the court was really planning to distribute official land and the land of wealthy elites to the farmers, then the bottom-tier farmers would undoubtedly erect shrines for Zhu Yunwen. Peace would prevail, and there would be no great turmoil.
Just as Lin Tai and Song Baogui were deep in thought, Liu De, a county runner from the county office in Luling, also received a letter. The letter had been delivered by a censor’s messenger from the capital city. Liu De had accompanied this censor during an investigation in Luling before, which had led to a positive relationship between them.
Liu De was illiterate, so he handed the letter to his fourteen-year-old son.
When his son read the line, “Exemplary assessment of petty officials and opportunities for their children to enter officialdom,” Liu De was immediately moved to tears. He knelt on the ground, facing north, and cried out, “Heaven has opened its eyes! The emperor is wise!”
Then, standing up, Liu De looked at his son’s hopeful eyes and choked up as he said, “My child, you can continue your studies now. You can continue your studies!”

Chapter 84: Spring Examination reformed into College Entrance Examination, Laundry Outsourcing
In early February, under the recommendation of the Ministry of Rites, Zhu Yunwen honored his biological father Zhu Biao as Emperor Xiaokang, with the temple name Xingzong. His mother, Lady Chang, was honored as Empress Xiaokang, and his mother, Concubine Lv, was honored as the Empress Dowager.
After the matter was settled, Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, remained dissatisfied.
This was because Zhu Yunwen had discounted the Ministry of Rites’ recommendation by not enfeoffing his own younger brothers as regional kings, nor designating his son as the crown prince.
This did not conform to the traditional protocol.
Designating a crown prince?
Zhu Yunwen was quite speechless, looking at Zhu Wenkui, who could barely walk steadily. Making such a young child the crown prince? Pairing him with officials from the Eastern Palace to educate him every day?
No, traditional education made him very uneasy. Could you explain why flowers are so red?
If you can’t explain, then step aside and let me take care of him for a few years.
While Zhu Yunwen was concerned about his son’s education, Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, was worrying about the nationwide education issue.
Due to Zhu Yunwen’s rash decisions, the spring examination originally scheduled for the following year was moved up by a year to June 6th of this year.
Since it was now scheduled for June, the term “spring examination” clearly wasn’t appropriate.
June is scorching hot.
How about calling it the “college entrance examination (高考)”?
With the adjustment of the time for the imperial examination, the provincial-level examinations (乡试, xiangshi) needed to be aligned with the higher-level examinations (会试, huishi). Therefore, they could only be arranged in February.
“乡试” is not to be taken literally as a test in the countryside. The “乡” here refers to local areas, and the “会” in “会试” refers to the central government. So “乡试” can be understood as provincial-level examinations.
In previous years, it was scheduled for August, during the autumn examination. After the provincial-level examination, individuals would become “举人” (juren), also known as “孝廉” (xiaolian).
The top scorer was called “解元” (jiexuan), the second was “亚元” (yayuan), the third, fourth, and fifth were “经魁” (jingkui), and the sixth was “亚魁” (yakui).
“举人(Juren)” has the qualification to become an official; otherwise, why do you think Fan Jin went mad? Besides the remnants of the feudal society, it can only be said that he was so delighted that he lost his mind.
Once stepping into the system, young people find it hard to sleep for several nights, let alone an old man?
However, being a Juren only means having the qualification to become an official, not necessarily becoming one.
Just like buying a lottery ticket, you definitely have the chance to win, but who can say for sure if you will win?
Throughout nearly three centuries of the Ming Dynasty, the juren who passed the examination during the Hongwu reign were the luckiest; their chances of winning the lottery were the highest.
When Zhu Yuanzhang purged the officials by the thousands, leaving many positions vacant, how could they handle it? The government offices needed people to stamp and handle affairs. There was no choice but to recruit juren to make up the numbers.
Thus, many juren were excited and went to the county government with their lottery tickets. However, before Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang could fulfill the promise of five wens on the lottery ticket, they were sent to the underworld.
In the present Jianwen era, there weren’t many opportunities for the juren to become officials. After all, these years didn’t have large-scale cases to sweep through, and there weren’t many vacant positions. They couldn’t just draw circles all day and curse the officials to retire sooner or join Emperor Taizu.
In comparison, it was better to carry a schoolbag and participate in the metropolitan examination in the capital.
The provincial examination of the Ming Dynasty was held in the capital cities of the Southern and Northern zhili provinces, as well as the administrative centers of various provincial administrative offices.
The capital of the Southern Zhili province was none other than Nanjing, where the chief examiners were Fang Xiaoru and Chen Di.
As for the idea of advancing the imperial examination, although the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries didn’t oppose it, they still held doubts in their minds.
No one is clear about why Zhu Yunwen is doing this.
Zhu Yunwen couldn’t tell them that he was causing chaos just to let two individuals step onto the historical stage ahead of time.
Kunning Palace.
After handling the matters of the harem, Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, who was telling stories to Zhu Wenkui, and smiled, “Your Majesty, I haven’t heard of the stories you’re telling. What is Alibaba?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly and said, “It’s just a name.”
“What a strange name, certainly not a name from the Ming Dynasty,” Ma Enhui took over Zhu Wenkui, looking pleased, and said, “Seeing Your Majesty so close to the crown prince brings great joy to us. When you were in the Eastern Palace, you didn’t have so much time to spend with Wenkui.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled awkwardly, changed the topic, and asked, “How is the weaving progress?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen and said helplessly, “Although we’ve added more weaving machines and recruited some manpower, it’s still not enough. We produced four hundred boxes yesterday, which is far from the six hundred boxes I aimed for.”
Zhu Yunwen pondered for a moment and earnestly said, “Empress, solving this matter is actually quite easy, but I don’t know if the Empress is willing…”
Ma Enhui became interested and said eagerly, “If it can solve the weaving crisis, I will agree. However, among the twenty-four bureaus, many have already been seconded. If we continue to transfer people, it might affect the daily affairs of the harem.”
Zhu Yunwen stood up and said, “Empress, you mentioned transferring people, but in my opinion, there’s one bureau within the Eight Bureaus that doesn’t need to exist. If we abolish it, not only can we free up enough space, but it can also address the shortage of weaving personnel.”
“The Eight Bureaus?”
Ma Enhui frowned slightly.
The Eight Bureaus, namely the Palace Armament Bureau, Jewelry service, Laundry service, Caps and Kerchief services, Sewing service, Weaving and Dyeing service, Condiments service, and Garden service.
The Eight Bureaus were directly related to the palace’s food and clothing expenses. None of these bureaus could be abandoned.
“I truly can’t think of any.”
Ma Enhui shook her head.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the clothes and said, “Empress, I believe the Laundry service can be abolished and replaced with a palace weaving bureau, specifically responsible for producing medical gauze and alcohol-soaked materials.”
“The Laundry service?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen in disbelief.
The Laundry service was responsible for cleaning the palace’s clothes. If they abolished it, who would wash the clothes in the future? Surely she wouldn’t have to do it herself?
Zhu Yunwen smiled slightly and said to Ma Enhui, “Empress, there are two advantages to abolishing the Laundry service. First, it’s a difficult place to work, and you remember what Lady Luo’s hands looked like, I believe you recall. Second, the Laundry service has enough personnel, is located outside the palace, has plenty of space, and it’s convenient for stocking and delivering.”
Ma Enhui sighed and said, “Then, Your Majesty, answer me one question: after abolishing the Laundering service, which bureau will be responsible for cleaning the palace’s clothes?”
Zhu Yunwen confidently looked at Ma Enhui and said two words, “Outsourcing.”
“Outsourcing?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, confused by another term she didn’t understand, and asked, “What is outsourcing?”
Zhu Yunwen walked to the table, picked up the abacus Ma Enhui often used, and said, “Empress, consider it this way: after abolishing the Laundry Service, convert everything to weaving workshops. How much daily revenue does it bring? Then calculate: if we find a group of people within the capital to clean the palace’s clothes, at a rate of three to four hundred wens per day, how many people are needed and what’s the expenditure?”
“If the revenue gained exceeds the expenditure, it means there’s still profit to be made daily. If there’s profit, why not give it a try? It could also provide a way out for those palace maids.”
Ma Enhui understood. Zhu Yunwen meant to have the Laundry service handle weaving, while a different group of people would handle laundering.
However, finding those people would likely require spending money…
“What Your Majesty says makes sense. However, entrusting outsiders to handle the palace’s clothes might not be appropriate. If there are problems, how should we address them? Furthermore, if news of this reaches the officials, it might cause a disturbance.”
Ma Enhui expressed her concerns.
Zhu Yunwen approached Ma Enhui and said lightly, “Empress, do you know how many widows without support are in the capital? If, as the empress, you use the name of the harem to assign the task of the Laundry service, and support their livelihoods, even if officials hear about it, they would only praise it in their memorials. What kind of disturbance could it cause?”
Ma Enhui’s eyes brightened. If it worked out that way, wouldn’t she gain both fame and benefits?
This might be a feasible solution.

Chapter 85: The People’s Sentiments in the weathered Smile
Wuying Hall.
Liu Changge held a stack of documents and handed them to Shuangxi. Shuangxi gently placed the documents on Zhu Yunwen’s desk, then quietly stepped aside, waiting.
Zhu Yunwen reviewed a memorial, then pointed to another one nearby. He said to Shuangxi, “Deliver these to the office of transmission and inform them that these documents must not be moved.”
“As you command.”
Shuangxi collected the memorials and arranged for them to be sent out of the palace.
Zhu Yunwen went through the intelligence reports brought by the Security Bureau. His expression grew darker as he read. He turned to Liu Changge and said, “The policy to curb land consolidation has not yet been fully implemented, but there are already individuals colluding with the Agricultural Tax Office, Provincial Administration Office, and Inspection Bureau. If this is the way they intend to truly implement it, are they merely saying one thing and doing another? Are they taking me for a fool?”
“Your Majesty, news has leaked, and local officials are finding ways to respond. Some officials and wealthy landowners have begun to return land, but based on reports from places like Southern Zhili and Jiangsu-Zhejiang, the numbers are not significant. Most officials and landowners are choosing to wait and see. Some Gentry, tempted by substantial rewards, have colluded with the Agricultural Tax Office, Provincial administration office, and Inspection Bureau in an attempt to secure their land.”
Liu Changge replied solemnly.
Zhu Yunwen gave a bitter laugh. Indeed, where there’s a policy, there will be countermeasures.
These individuals were willing to spare no expense, knowing that bribing just the Agricultural Tax Office wouldn’t be enough, so they decided to bribe officials from the Provincial administration office and the Inspection Bureau as well.
Waiting and watching?
Let them continue to wait. They’ll have their moment to cry.
On 12th of February, the Grand Secretariat’s Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin submitted a joint memorial titled “Policy to Measure Land and Trace Property Origins to Curb Land Consolidation and Contributions.” After Zhu Yunwen approved and stamped it, the decree was officially announced to the entire realm on the 15th of February.
Countless couriers rushed across the country’s roads on swift horses, carrying the imperial decree.
Changzhou Prefecture, Yixing.
Wu Guang from the County Agricultural Tax Office, Wan Biao from the Administration office, and Meng Zhiyuan from the Inspection Bureau, along with more than sixty members of the land measuring team composed of officials and commoners, received the imperial decree titled “Policy to Measure Land and Trace Property Origins to Curb Land Consolidation and Contributions.”
Under a nearby willow tree, five or six wealthy landowners gathered together. After exchanging glances, smiles emerged on their faces.
“Is everything prepared?”
Zhao Qipin, a retired official for three years, asked casually.
Qian Fushen tightened his belt, his jowls quivering, and said, “Of course. This is the foundation of our livelihoods. How could we easily part with it? It cost us some, but we’ve managed to settle everything.”
Sun Funong cleared his throat and hoarsely said, “After ten years of hard work, with your guidance, we’ve gathered scattered pieces of land. Now that we’ve finally consolidated so much land, how can we just give it back to those penniless peasants? Up above, they’re still too young.”
“Be careful with your words; we mustn’t talk lightly about matters above.”
Li Fushang cautioned, looking around cautiously. He then lowered his voice and said, “Stick to the plan. We can’t let those tenant farmers get away. Otherwise, we’ll be in big trouble.”
“Ha, don’t worry. The tenant farmers are all waiting in the prefectural office. They’ve heard about rewards today, so they won’t dare to leave their homes. Furthermore, they won’t know about the land measurement today. As long as we get through the next couple of days, we’ll be safe and sound.”
Zhao Qipin said confidently.
Qian Fushen squinted his eyes and reminded, “Shh, they’re coming.”
The wealthy landowners ceased their conversation.
Wu Guang, Wan Biao, and Meng Zhiyuan let their team wait in place and walked toward the wealthy landowners.
Zhao Qipin was the first to step forward, bowing and saying, “Gentlemen, you’ve worked hard. I wonder when the land measurement will begin. We could prepare some tea to offer as refreshment.”
Wu Guang’s face was stern. He took out a weighty money pouch from his sleeve and threw it to Zhao Qipin. Wan Biao and Meng Zhiyuan also pulled out money pouches and handed them to the landowners.
“What is the meaning of this?”
Zhao Qipin was flustered.
Wu Guang spoke in a deep voice, “By imperial decree, we have been reassigned to oversee land measurements in Changxing County, Huzhou. We are no longer responsible for Yixing. The land measurement in Yixing will now be conducted by officials from Changxing. They will take over.”
“Ah?”
The wealthy landowners turned pale instantly, filled with fear.
This took several days, wining and dining, just when we’ve established good connections, and now you’re changing places?
Can the newcomers be as greedy as you are?
What if there’s one who isn’t greedy? Won’t our plans fall apart?
Meng Zhiyuan looked at these wealthy landowners and cautioned, “Don’t even think about bribing officials from the Agricultural Tax Office, provincial Administration office, or Inspection Bureau anymore. The court has announced that a hundred top-quality land measurement teams will be selected from across the nation. They will not only enjoy the honor of being among the first to bear the national emblem of Ming, but their names will also be inscribed on a monument outside the palace gates. This concerns matters for generations to come, and no one will give up on it. Take care of yourselves!”
After speaking, the three officials turned and left. They left one person to manage the land measurement team and coordinate with the incoming officials from Changxing. The rest of the team mounted horses and headed straight for Changxing.
The wealthy landowners were left with no way out. They stumbled back to their homes and began returning the land. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time.
Although the tenant farmers couldn’t read, they still sensed that something unusual was happening. In the past, these landowners either barged in forcibly confiscated their remaining grain or even whipped them. Even when they were sick, they had to go work in the fields.
Had there ever been a day when they smiled at them and even offered land contracts?
The tenant farmers found it hard to believe. Who knew if anyone dared to reach out, they might be taken away and fed to the dogs.
The wealthy landowners tried to hand the land contracts to each person’s embrace, but the contracts fell to the ground, and no one dared to pick them up.
“Please take them back and go home. Isn’t that enough?!”
“Someone, give each of them one tael of silver and let them take the land contracts!”
“Master, these land contracts are useless to them…”
“What?”
“These land contracts are under your name, Master.”
“Then quickly have someone write new land contracts! Go fetch the official Wang from the government office!”
“But, Master, according to the new court regulations, land transactions must be managed by the Agricultural Tax Office, supervised by the Inspection Bureau, and reported to the Provincial administration office. The officials from the Agricultural Tax Office have already left…”
“Something’s not right, Master fainted.”
After arriving in Yixing, Hu Jun wasted no time. After discussing with Yang Chengxuan, the office manager, and Wang Wenfeng from the Inspection Bureau, he divided the land measurement team into three groups and began measuring the land on the same day.
In just ten days, they measured forty thousand mu of land. Among them, three wealthy landowners compensated tenant farmers with as much as five thousand taels each. One landowner compensated three thousand taels, there was no more wealth left to compensate.
Hu Jun didn’t give the Landowner a hard time. He priced their remaining land, turning it into silver, and transferred it to the tenant farmers. If it wasn’t enough compensation, then their remaining property would be sold off.
Even if they had to exhaust their wealth, there was no need to hurry. First, see how many family members they had. If there were ten people, no problem. The eighty mu of land over there would be theirs. The county office would provide them with oxen, seeds, farming tools, and basic provisions.
Work diligently, 1/15 tax rate, not like the two-tax-one you were used to. Just work for a year, and your family’s food problem will be solved.
The self-sufficient farmers who gained land and freedom, voluntarily brought eggs, food, and even a very old man who slaughtered their only remaining hen, personally bringing it to the Agricultural Tax Office and the Inspection Bureau.
Hu Jun ate an egg and took a sip of chicken soup. The old man smiled happily, while tears streamed down the faces of the officials from the Agricultural Tax Office.
The people’s sentiment, this is the people’s sentiment!
The people’s sentiment is in this egg, in this chicken soup, in the weathered smiles of this old man and the elderly farmer!
Choked up, Hu Jun turned around, picked up a brush, and wrote: “I, Hu Jun, bow deeply in Yixing. As national policies are implemented, the people’s sentiment is harmonious. At this moment, I finally comprehend that while obtaining land is easy, winning people’s hearts is difficult…”

Chapter 86: Zhu Di’s Analysis: The Five-Year Window Period
“Without land, people have no roots; without roots, they wither. The gentry exploiting the tenants have no freedom, no remaining family assets. Even after hundreds or thousands of years, they will remain in poverty, unchanging. Reflecting on the national strategy, it’s like spring rain nourishing countless fields, promising prosperity…”
Fang Xiaoru read aloud Hu Jun’s memorial to the assembled officials.
The officials listened, deeply moved by the words.
Especially among the officials who had tried to send urgent letters to their families to dispose of improper land, only to be laughed at and disregarded, continuing to visit their fields each day.
Now, things had taken a turn for the worse.
Reports from various regions showed that in Huizhou Prefecture alone, over 150 gentry families had lost everything. Families that were once part of the middle class were now destitute.
Although the court’s policy was comprehensive, providing land and resources to those affected, the sudden change in status was difficult for these people to accept.
It was said that a few individuals couldn’t cope and had hung themselves from crooked-necked trees. Without leaving any explanation, they had gone to appeal to the ancestor.
Facing such tragedy, Zhu Yunwen could only accept it reluctantly.
At present, even if a few people died or even dozens died, he could accept it! Their deaths were the price paid for the future survival of the Great Ming Empire and the prevention of the deaths of tens of millions of people two hundred years later!
Hu Jun’s memorial brought Zhu Yunwen considerable comfort.
The reports from local agriculture tax offices also confirmed one thing: the common people were welcoming and supportive of this policy!
As long as the people supported it, then the policy of “Regulating Land and Investigating Property to Restrain Land Consolidation and Contributions” should be fully implemented.
Huang Zicheng, the Minister of Revenue, announced new salary standards with a fifty percent increase. This delighted all court officials. Compared to the stingy old ruler Zhu Yuanzhang, Zhu Yunwen was clearly more compassionate.
And incorporating petty officials into the salary structure, despite facing opposition from some officials, remained unassailable in the face of Xie Jin’s retort.
Xie Jin asked, “Aren’t petty officials human too? Don’t they also work for the court? Why shouldn’t they receive a salary?”
Not qualified?
So what if they’re not qualified? Does that mean they don’t work?
You are qualified, does that mean you work?
Are you living off the court?
All you know is how to babbling around. Which department are you in?
When did you enter the palace?
Your Majesty, I, Xie Jin accuse the Office of Scrutiny for War’s Supervising Secretary Liu Donglai of sitting idle, having been in the palace for three years without any notable contributions. It would be better to send him to the ministry of revenue’s warehouse, to keep company with the other thirty-nine people…
Upon hearing this, Zhu Yunwen was infuriated and, using the pretext of “The court doesn’t support idlers,” streamlined the personnel of the six ministries. The warehouse alone had nearly forty people, even if it were filled with gold and silver, it wouldn’t be enough to support them!
For the Two Capitals and Thirteen Provinces, the policy adopted by the court was to remove redundant staff, establish standards, and directly eliminate a large number of unnecessary and excessive bureaucratic officials and petty officials.
As for the officials in the capital, Zhu Yunwen didn’t spare them either. Although the number of officials in the capital was not high at this time, roughly only around three thousand, there were issues of excessive bloat in some positions, while some other positions had insufficient personnel.
The bloat was due to many officials using connections to secure their positions.
The shortage was because Old Zhu had executed too many officials.
Zhu Yunwen was decisive. He got rid of the bloated and useless positions, accelerated the imperial examinations, and prepared to bring a new batch of officials on board earlier.
To encourage the smooth reduction of redundant staff both in the capital and provinces, and to expedite their removal, Zhu Yunwen employed a tactic that left the grand secretariat, the six ministries, and the local administrations both amused and frustrated.
The new salary system was propagated, informing all officials and petty officials that the court intended to give them a raise.
When would this new salary system be implemented?
After you streamline the institutions, clear out the redundant personnel, create a new roster of officials, and submit it to the court. The court will send people to verify it. Once the verification is approved, the new salary will be distributed according to the new scale.
Whichever province submits the roster of officials first will be the first to receive the new salary. If Jiangxi Province completes its roster in February and the court verifies it in March, the new salary will be implemented that month. If the old salary has already been paid for that month, the difference will be paid retroactively.
If any province delays, the court doesn’t mind. If you want to delay it for ten years, that’s also fine. However, it’s about the welfare of all officials in a province, and I’m afraid no one would be willing to delay, right?
With Single Whip method, the basic issue of agricultural taxes was resolved, promoting land development and cultivation.
With one national policy, the excessive consolidation and contributions of land were curbed, releasing a large amount of land and expanding the scope of taxation.
Innovating the salary system, favoring bureaucrats, bringing petty officials back on track, and reducing bottom-level manipulation.
The three flames of the first year of the Jianwen reign burned fiercely and brightly across the land of the Ming Dynasty.
Central Army Commandery Headquarters.
Zhu Di stood before a map of the Great Ming Empire, his gaze fixed on the northern frontier.
The once glorious Yuan Empire, now appears to have only the remnants of its former glory, like the setting sun in the west.
Eleven years ago, in the Battle of Buir Lake, Lan Yu achieved a great victory over the Yuan army, capturing over fifty individuals, including the second son of Tögüs Temür and his concubines. He also captured fifty thousand troops, seventy thousand men and women, and one hundred thousand horses, camels, cattle, and sheep.
Naturally, this was Lan Yu’s pinnacle battle, one that was widely praised.
However, in Lan Yu’s heart, perhaps it wasn’t so.
The Battle of Buir Lake was a victory, but not a perfect one.
Because Lan Yu had failed to capture Tögüs Temür, the khan of the Northern Yuan!
This was a disgrace for Lan Yu!
It’s unclear if it was due to this disgrace that Lan Yu vented his anger and dissatisfaction on Tögüs Temür’s concubines.
In the Battle of Buir Lake, Tögüs Temür’s eldest son, Tian Baonu, official Nie Qielai, and Prime Minister Shilie Meng, along with several cavalries, managed to escape. However, after fleeing for four to five months, Tian Baonu was killed by the descendant of Ariq Böke, Yesüder.
Yesüder assassinated the Khan, seizing the khan seal, and ascended to the throne of the Northern Yuan. His power gradually grew, and he established himself in the northern desert.
In the twenty-fourth year of the Hongwu reign, Yesüder passed away, succeeded by his son Engke. However, Engke’s reign lasted less than four years before he died during internal conflicts.
After Engke’s death, a compromise was reached between the Oirat Mongols and the orthodox Eastern Mongols. They supported the son of Emperor Zhaozhong of Yuan, Maidilibala, as the Khan, titled ” Nigülesügchi Khan.”
Although Maidilibala was a descendant of Kublai Khan, he clearly lacked Kublai’s ambition. He was not only lascivious but also cruel and lacked discernment.
Looking at the map of the northern frontier, Zhu Di turned to Xu Huizu beside him and said, “Maidilibala’s time is coming to an end.”
Xu Huizu shook his head slightly, unconvinced, and said, “Although Maidilibala is foolish and heartless, accomplishing nothing, he still controls the Oirat. He has capable ministers and generals under his command, and I’m afraid he won’t die easily.”
“No.” Zhu Di looked at Xu Huizu confidently and said, “The Oirat Mongols admire strength and power. An unaccomplished Great Khan cannot maintain his position for long.”
“Based on your perspective, will the Oirat become a new threat to the Ming Dynasty?”
Xu Huizu furrowed his brows and asked.
Zhu Di nodded and said, “The four divisions of the Oirat are not to be underestimated. Although they might appear weak now, they’ve been resting and recovering in the West. In the future, this tribe might control Mongolia.”
Xu Huizu glanced at the map and asked, “Will the current Tatars pose a threat to the Ming Dynasty?”
Zhu Di squinted, pondered for a moment, and then shook his head slightly, saying, “The current Mongols are embroiled in internal conflict and lack the necessary strength and resources to invade the Great Ming. However, as you also know, the Tatars, as the legitimate rulers of the Mongols, have always desired to restore the glory of the Northern Yuan.”
“In the short term, within the next three to five years, the Tatars won’t pose a threat to the Great Ming. But if their ambitions grow in five to ten years, they will inevitably challenge our borders. These next five years are of the utmost importance for us to strengthen our military.”

Chapter 87: The New Army Policy’s roadblock – The Garrison System
The Directorate of Ceremonial’s Vice eunuch director Wang Yue, entered the Wuying Hall and greeted Zhu Yunwen. After bowing, he said, “Your Majesty, the debate between King of Yan and the Duke of Wei has reached its conclusion.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and asked with a smile, “Are they discussing the New Army policy again?”
Wang Yue showed the utmost respect and replied, “Your Majesty, today’s discussion is about the Tatars and Oirat.”
Zhu Yunwen took the document with interest, carefully read it, and then said solemnly, “Summon King of Yan and the Duke of Wei, also bring Xie Jin, Yao Guangxiao, and Ru Chang here.”
Wang Yue left to carry out the order.
As the Grand Secretariat was located within the palace, Xie Jin entered the Wuying Hall ahead of others upon receiving the summons.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t say much, he simply handed the debate between Zhu Di and Xu Huizu to Xie Jin. After going through it, Xie Jin understood that Zhu Yunwen’s attention had shifted towards Mongolia, or rather, towards the potential threats to Great Ming in the coming years.
Zhu Di, Xu Huizu, Ru Chang, and Yao Guangxiao arrived together.
Zhu Yunwen spread out the grand map of Ming and said, “Today I have reviewed the debate between King of Yan and the Duke of Wei. Uncle Yan believes that the Mongol tribes still pose the greatest threat to Ming. While the Tatar and Oirat are currently engaged in internal conflicts and won’t trouble us for three to five years, they are likely to become a threat to us five to ten years from now. I’ve called you all here to hear your opinions, to discuss how stable the northern borders can be for the next few years.”
Zhu Di and Xu Huizu remained silent.
Xie Jin and Fang Xiaoru looked toward Ru Chang. As the Minister of War, he was expected to provide insight on military matters and should be the first to speak.
Ru Chang looked at the northern borders of Great Ming and said solemnly, “Your Majesty, based on the information we currently have, the Tatar and Oirat tribes are in constant internal strife and no single faction seems to be overwhelmingly dominant. Moreover, we have established strong defenses in the northern border regions through our garrisons and fortifications. Given the current circumstances, the Tatar and Oirat are unlikely to pose a threat to our Great Ming in the short term.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and asked, “Your opinion aligns with Uncle Yan’s. How long do you consider the ‘short term’ to be?”
Rather than answering directly, Ru Chang pondered for a moment and then replied, “Three to five years, Your Majesty.”
Zhu Yunwen turned his gaze to Yao Guangxiao and inquired, “Master Yao, please share your thoughts.”
Xie Jin, Ru Chang, and Xu Huizu found Yao Guangxiao’s presence quite unexpected in a discussion of such significant military matters.
Yao Guangxiao, currently a Hanlin Academician Expositor-inwaiting, should have been present in discussions related to Confucian classics and literature. However, involving him in discussions about national defense matters suggested a deeper meaning behind this decision.
“While the Tatar may lack the strength they once had, they still consider themselves the legitimate Mongol lineage. This implies that the Tatar will inevitably pursue policies that are adversarial towards Ming.”
Yao Guangxiao didn’t hold back any longer.
All that he has sought in his life is to realize the aspirations within his heart. Now that the opportunity has come, there is no need to hide any longer. He dedicates all of his wisdom in the remaining years of his life to this realm of Ming.
“However, due to their limited strength and internal conflicts, the Tatar won’t be able to consolidate their forces for a large-scale invasion in the next five years. Nevertheless, during these five years, we might face sporadic raids involving a few hundred or even a few thousand mounted warriors, which may not cease.”
Yao Guangxiao pointed his finger towards regions such as Suzhou, Ningxia, Kaiping, and Daning, and continued, “In these areas, bolstered by the garrisons, the Great Wall, and our standing army, the defense should be adequate. From this perspective, the northern border of Ming should be secure for the next five years.”
“And what about the Oirat?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Yao Guangxiao with appreciation and inquired.
Yao Guangxiao looked at the location of Oirat on the map and said, “When I was in Beiping, I heard about Maidilibala, not a virtuous leader. His actions were despicable and disgraceful. Such a person cannot last long, and internal strife in the Oirat is imminent.”
“Unexpectedly, Master Yao has such insight! Admirable!” praised Xie Jin.
Xie Jin applauded in admiration, looking at Yao Guangxiao with newfound respect.
Zhu Yunwen greatly admired Yao Guangxiao and Zhu Di’s prediction Maidilibala will die soon. Historically, Maidilibala would indeed die in the internal strife this year. This year was later referred to by later generations as the “Beginning of Oirat Dominance.”
“Xie Jin, you have foresight. How do you view the situation with the Tatar and the Oirat?” Zhu Yunwen casually inquired.
Xie Jin shook his head slightly and said, “Your Majesty, I believe that the opinions of the King of Yan, the Duke of Wei, Minister Ru, and Master Yao are all insightful. After reviewing various information, while the Tatar and the Oirat might have ambitions, at least for the next five years, there won’t be significant issues on the northern border of Ming.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di and the others, then lightly tapped the table and said, “A King experienced in battles, a duke overseeing the Central Army Commandery, a Minister of War, a Grand Secretary with extensive knowledge, and a scholar well-versed in various matters – since you all unanimously believe that the northern border will remain relatively stable for the next five years, let’s set the tone: within these five years, the implementation of the New Army policy across the entire military. How about it?”
“Agreed!” stated Zhu Di and the others.
Xie Jin hesitated for a moment and said, “Your Majesty, the implementation of the New Army policy within the capital’s military presents no issues. However, there have been quite a few problems encountered when implementing the strategy within the Beiping Garrison.”
“Oh, what problems?” Zhu Yunwen asked, surprised.
Xie Jin handed over a document and said, “This is a document regarding the implementation of the New Army policy in Beiping Prefecture. It mentions that the New Army policy emphasizes training, which contributes to enhancing the army’s combat capabilities. However, the New Army policy conflicts significantly with the Garrison system, leading to a number of problems.”
Zhu Yunwen unfolded the document and read it, involuntarily taking a deep breath.
Ming established dominance through military prowess, and Zhu Yuanzhang reformed the old system, establishing the Garrison system throughout the empire, from the capital to the counties.
The Garrison system selected individuals to be part of the military, stationed in various garrisons to defend the borders and suppress local uprisings.
There was a parallel relationship between military and civilian statuses. Military personnel were under the jurisdiction of the Five Military Commandery, while civilians were managed by the Ministry of Revenue.
The difference between military personnel and soldiers was significant.
Military service is hereditary and fixed; once you are part of the military, your entire family will be required to serve, living within the garrison.
If you unfortunately sacrifice yourself for the country, it’s not a problem either. Take a look if you have a son; if not, find your brother. If you don’t have a brother either, then find your cousin. There will always be someone to take your place.
In the unfortunate event, that your entire family is gone, there’s still a solution. Look at your original hometown, find your clan members, select a lineage, and relocate them to continue the military service.
Soldiers, on the other hand, were voluntary and temporary recruits. They weren’t part of the established military structure, lacked fixed numbers, garrisoned locations, and were separate from their descendants’ career choices.
During the early Ming Dynasty, military expenses constituted a small portion of the imperial budget. Two million dan of grain were enough to sustain three million soldiers annually. In many instances, military expenses were considered “self-sufficient.”
This was linked to the Garrison system. Garrisons were a fusion of military and agricultural life. When at war, they functioned as a military force; otherwise, they worked as farmers, cultivating fields and tending to crops.
On one side, tending to the crops with hands wielding sickles, while on the other side, signals of war spread, allowing for an immediate switch to armor and the grasping of steel swords to fight the enemy.
If the harvest from the military settlements isn’t sufficient to cover the expenses of the army, then have merchants hire people to cultivate the frontier. By exchanging the cultivated crops for salt permit from the court, a win-win situation can be achieved for both the merchants and the border troops.
What seemed like a beautiful existence, after going through the storms of the Hongwu era, has begun to reveal its problems. The signs of decline and collapse of the garrisons are becoming increasingly evident.
Furthermore, the integration of military and agricultural duties within garrisons severely hindered proper military training.
Just imagine, a collective farming army, how much time could they have for training? How much mastery of combat skills could they attain?
Without reforming the Garrison System, it will be difficult to implement the New Army strategy!

Chapter 88: Tragic Military Camps, Helpless Zhu Yunwen
The New Army policy was implemented in Beiping during the winter, a season with little agricultural activity. It wasn’t a problem for everyone to get up early and do some running, exercising their bodies.
However, now it’s already spring, and everyone is still thinking about their several dozen acres of land. You can’t continue training every day, right?
The court has regulations that every military household in the garrison must cultivate a portion of land.
Someone mentioned that it’s just a small piece of land, easy to plow a few times and get it ready. Does it really take that much time and affect the training?
Sorry to say, in the Ming Dynasty, a “portion” in a military camp was generally around fifty mu.
For each soldier’s portion of land, according to regulations, they had to yield eighteen dan of grain, submitting six dan and keeping twelve dan for themselves. If the harvest was poor, or even failed completely, you still had to compensate the full amount, commonly known as making up the difference.
The garrison system and military farm system did indeed play significant roles in the early Ming Dynasty.
By the first year of the Jianwen era, there were over 1.2 million troops involved in cultivation, adding nearly 90 million mu of land. They gathered more than 23 million dan of grain annually, This is also the key factor of the early Ming Dynasty, where the low agricultural taxes could still support an army of two to three million.
However, after two or three decades of implementing the Garrison System and Military Farm System, numerous problems have emerged.
Regarding the Garrison System, Xu Huizu pointed out four issues:
Firstly, the issue of desertion among military households.
This is actually understandable. Who can guarantee a bountiful harvest year after year?
If it doesn’t rain all year and the crops fail completely, how are we supposed to deliver our grain?
When we can’t survive, isn’t it natural to try and escape?
Secondly, the issue of military officers seizing land.
Scholars understand that taking land from peasants can bring benefits, and even though military officers may be unrefined, they are not ignorant and comprehend the value of land.
Fifty mu of land for a soldier? Alright, go cultivate fifty mu on the barren wasteland eighty miles away. Those fifty mu of fertile land will become mine.
Oh, and don’t forget to come back and water my crops after you’ve finished working on that wasteland.
When a military officer gives an order, you have to obey, right?
Thirdly, the issue of vassal kings’ annexation.
Take a look at the northern border of the Ming Dynasty and then observe the various vassal kings who hold their own territories. You will notice that wherever there are vassal kings, there is inevitably land reclamation.
Especially in regions like Ganzhou, Guyuan, Ningxia, Yansui, Datong, Xuanfu, Jizhou, Liaodong, and other nine border areas. These places not only have land reclamation but also maintain large armies, all under the control of vassal kings.
When the territories of the vassal kings are right next to the reclaimed land, it’s almost understandable if they accidentally seize a few million acres more.
Who let the field is adjacent, you soldiers are also at fault, why don’t you make the field ridge well?
This King didn’t see it, sorry.
Fourthly, poor military farms, and unrealiable harvests, severely affects training.
In the early Ming Dynasty, military farms did not seize land from the people. Many of the military farms used the abandoned land left by landowners and farmers killed during the Yuan Dynasty, or land that had been reclaimed through cultivation.
Fertile lands naturally weren’t assigned to the soldiers. For the majority of soldiers, the land they received was often barren and infertile, not suitable for farming. Moreover, these lands were scattered, requiring them to clear grass in the west in the morning and dig ditches in the east in the afternoon, making it difficult to meet production quotas.
Coupled with the tools promised by the court for cultivation, they were available at the start but disappeared later.
Yes, the court promised to provide cattle for soldiers’ plowing, but the Ming Dynasty didn’t have many cattle to begin with. Where would they find a large number of cattle to allocate to the military farms?
You are lucky, you received a cattle ten years ago. Now you say the cattle has died, and you still want another one?
No chance, use yourself as the cattle.
This is what Zhu Yuanzhang took pride in, the Garrison System and Military Farm System, the once-bold statement of “I maintain an army of a million without burdening the people with a single grain.” Yet, when it came to Zhu Yunwen’s time, all that remained was a suppressed sense of tragedy.
Zhu Yunwen really wanted to reform the Garrison System, but he also understood that it was a minefield – one wrong step, and it could lead to mutiny.
When Zhu Houzhao become the emperor, the eunuch Liu Jin wanted to reform the military farms, which led to the rebellion of King of Anhua, Zhu Zhifan. Though it didn’t create a huge uproar, it was enough to tell Zhu Yunwen that changing the Garrison System wouldn’t happen overnight.
However, if the Garrison System isn’t resolved, the implementation of the New Army Policy would only be superficial, unable to achieve the goal of a strong military. The future of the Ming Dynasty would be limited to a defensive strategy.
Just defense, no offense – that’s not what Zhu Yunwen desired.
Since the mongols would inevitably attack sooner or later, Zhu Yunwen couldn’t let them easily return to their home to graze.
If they dared to invade a small step into Ming territory, then Ming should have the courage to march a million steps into Mongolia until they completely conquer the grasslands, making it the richest pasture for the Ming Dynasty!
With a sigh, Zhu Yunwen concluded his contemplation and placed Xu Huizu’s report on the desk, saying solemnly, “Currently, we’re at a critical point in enforcing single whip method and restraining land consolidation. However, the current court may not be able to sustain the expenses resulting from the relaxation of the garrison system.”
Xu Huizu naturally understood this point and empathized with Zhu Yunwen’s dilemma.
Enforcing the Single Whip method and restraining land consolidation offended numerous scholars and the gentry within the Ming Dynasty. Although these individuals lack the power to resist the court, losing benefits still causes discomfort, inevitably leading to some outcry.
There are many voices of criticism against the Single whip method and the policy of restraining land consolidation, especially coming from the gentry.
Zhu Yunwen managed to gather popular support but offended the gentry – this is to be expected. However, if the Garrison System is tampered with again, it won’t be about harming the gentry’s interests; instead, it will harm the interests of the Garrison officers and military officials in various regions.
These officers have strong control over the soldiers, they not only possess kitchen knives but eighteen different types of weapons at home. If pushed to their limits, they won’t hesitate to wield them.
If some gentry secretly supports this, and a certain vassal king with ambitions starts shouting the slogan “Restore ancestral traditions, protect our properties,” then that could spell trouble.
Although Xu Huizu also knows that these Garrison forces can’t rival the capital troops, once turmoil erupts, it will undoubtedly become a major issue.
This matter can only be handled gradually.
Zhu Yunwen frowned and said, “The new army policy in Beiping cannot be halted. As for the issue of Garrison land cultivation, let Zhang Bing, the Commissioner of Beiping, and Ping An, the Commander, come up with solutions and find a way out.”
Xu Huizu nodded in agreement.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di and said, “Uncle Yan, when it comes to military strategy and battle formations, I am far inferior to you. Even Duke Wei and Minister Ru are not on par with you. I’m thinking of entrusting the task of reforming the capital troops to you. What do you think?”
“Your Majesty…”
Zhu Di found it hard to believe.
As someone who had transgressed in the past and came to the capital to beg for forgiveness, he had thought that the best outcome he could hope for was to retain his title as King of Yan and live a leisurely life as a prince.
After their candid conversation following that drunken night, Zhu Yunwen hadn’t pursued his past action instead asking him to study the new army policy. Later on, he even appointed Zhu Di to Five army commandery, where he collaborated with Xu Huizu on the new army policy and the defense of the borders.
He had initially assumed he would just be an advisor, offering some ideas.
Unexpectedly, Zhu Yunwen had entrusted him with such a crucial task!
Reforming the capital troops!
This was a matter of national importance!
Zhu Yunwen looked deeply at Zhu Di, his gaze filled with anticipation.
After over half a year of implementing the new army policy in the capital troops, it achieved remarkable success. Even Zhu Di couldn’t help but praise it – the capital troops were now an elite force of the empire!
However, as the new army policy continued to progress, individual soldiers’ combat abilities improved, and research into formations of several thousand or tens of thousands of soldiers achieved significant results. But there remained an issue with coordinating large-scale battles for the capital troops.
The tactics for armies of one hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, or even three hundred thousand soldiers were entirely different from those for a few thousand or ten thousand.
Neither Xu Huizhu Ru Chang have experience in commanding large armies in battle. Relying solely on theoretical discussions and ancestral knowledge is far from sufficient.
Therefore, Zhu Yunwen needs Zhu Di, someone who is experienced in the battlefield and adept at commanding large army formations, to be the key figure in the reform of the Capital Garrison!

Chapter 89: The Political Insight of Suzhou prefecture Literati
Suzhou Prefect Yao Shan finished his official duties, changed into casual clothes, and holding a scroll of book, he entered the Confucian Temple.
In the courtyard of the Minglun Hall, Wang Bin, Han Yi, Yu Zhenmu, and Qian Qin were gathered, engaged in a scholarly discussion. Wang Bin lifted his head, spotted Yao Shan, and smiled faintly, signaling the discussion to pause. He bowed his hand, “Brother Ke Yi has arrived.”
Others turned slightly to pay their respects.
Yao Shan smiled heartily, tinged with a hint of apology, “Apologies, I’ve been occupied with official matters lately, and came a bit late.”
“It seems Brother Ke Yi is determined to secure the position of Suzhou as one of the top ten prefectures. If that day comes and your salary increases, you must treat us to more than three drinks,” Qian Qin teased.
Yao Shan patted the book in his hand, saying, “If Suzhou is selected as one of the top ten prefectures, don’t mention three drinks, I can afford five.”
“Indeed, generous…”
Yu Zhenmu disapproved.
Han Yi and the others burst into laughter, and even Yao Shan couldn’t help shaking his head.
Qian Qin led everyone to sit at the prepared seats nearby, then said, “Discussing classics and scholarly works is not our agenda for today.”
Yao Shan looked at Qian Qin in surprise, asking, “If not discussing classics and scholarly works, then what are we going to talk about?”
Qian Qin chuckled, taking out a small booklet from his sleeve. Yao Shan received it and saw that it was filled with suggestions about lifting restrictions on business and increasing commercial taxes.
After glancing through it, Yao Shan looked up at Qian Qin, saying, “Brother Qian, although your surname is Qian, you are ultimately one of Suzhou’s literati. In the past, you ridiculed and dismissed the ways of merchants, not approving of their practices. Why have you changed your stance today?”
Qian Qin smiled slightly, saying, “In the past, I disapproved because I believed business harms the people and is detrimental to the livelihood of the masses. However, as I wandered through Suzhou, I found countless traders and merchants bustling about. Brother Yao, aren’t you striving to make Suzhou one of the top ten prefectures? This, I believe, is the way to achieve victory.”
“Your so-called way to victory is to lift the bans on merchants and then heavily tax them? If that’s the case, I’d rather Suzhou not become one of the top ten prefectures!”
Yao Shan’s expression darkened.
Seeing the two men stiffening, Yu Zhenmu hurriedly intervened, “Brother Yao, please don’t get angry. Allow us to discuss and debate this matter.”
“Very well!”
Yao Shan said solemnly.
Yu Zhenmu looked at Qian Qin and said, “Brother Qian, go ahead.”
Qian Qin nodded earnestly and said to Yao Shan, “Brother Yao, we’ve known each other for many years, and I believe you know my character. But today, there are some things that I, Qian Qin, want to say, for the sake of Suzhou prefecture, for the sake of Great Ming!”
Yao Shan looked at Qian Qin, and the anger on his face gradually subsided.
Indeed, as Qian Qin said, they had been close friends for many years, and Yao Shan knew that he was not a materialistic person.
Qian Qin looked at Yao Shan seriously and said, “The court’s Single Whip Method’ and the strategy to curb land consolidation, I ask Brother Yao, has Suzhou implemented them?”
“All seven counties and one prefecture have fully implemented them, without delay.”
Yao Shan replied.
Suzhou prefecture comprised seven counties and one prefecture. The seven counties were Wuxian County, Changzhou County, Changshu County, Wujiang County, Kunshan County, Jiading County, and Chongming County. The prefecture was Taicang Prefecture.
Qian Qin then asked, “And the court’s changing the the tax rate from 1/30 to 1/15 rate, do you, Brother Yao, consider it heavy taxation?”
Yao Shan’s eyebrows furrowed slightly, “Compared to the various taxes and corvée labor mixed in previous years, 1/15 is not heavy.”
“Then why is it that when merchants are subjected to a 1/15 tax, it’s suddenly considered heavy taxation?”
Qian Qin countered.
Yao Shan hesitated for a moment, thought, and then said, “Merchants make their living by selling goods and making profits. Once the taxes increase, their profits will naturally decrease. At that point, Suzhou may likely suffer a decline in prosperity, with no more bustling trade.”
Qian Qin shook his head slightly, saying, “Brother Yao, you’re only half right. It’s true that merchants make profits, and higher taxes will reduce those profits. But it won’t necessarily lead to a decline.”
“Heh, without profits, won’t merchants seek greener pastures elsewhere?”
Yao Shan asked coldly.
Qian Qin took out a letter and handed it to Yao Shan, saying, “This is a letter from a friend in the capital’s Ministry of Revenue. Brother Yao, as an official in the prefectural government, you must be aware of the affairs of the Arts Troupe, right? It’s known that although the troupe is under the inner palace, its performances are high-priced and profit-oriented. Yet, they are subject to the 1/15 commercial tax. The Ministry of Revenue has reportedly gained thousands of taels of profit due to this.”
“While it’s a heavy tax, the Arts Troupe still makes substantial profits. Even after the implementation of the strategy to curb land consolidation, their performances continue unabated. This shows that the fifteen percent tax brings significant gains. Now, looking at the Ministry of Revenue, it has a richer treasury due to the increased taxes. If Brother Yao petitions the court and implements the 1/15 tax law, Suzhou’s merchants might not necessarily leave. However, the commercial tax revenue in Suzhou will substantially increase.”
Yao Shan glanced at the letter and said, “The Arts Troupe is merely women’s performances, not the trade of goods.”
“What about the medical gauze produced by the King of Liao and the King of Min? Isn’t that goods? Aren’t they also subject to the 1/15 tax?”
Qian Qin countered.
Yao Shan stood up and said, “The King of Liao and King of Min engage in commerce as kings. If we don’t tax them heavily, wouldn’t they dominate the market? Who could compete with them for profit?”
Qian Qin chuckled and took out another letter from his sleeve, saying, “Brother Yao, since you’ve put it this way, you seem to be falling behind. Don’t blame us for not reminding you.”
Perplexed, Yao Shan unfolded the letter and widened his eyes, asking, “This, this can’t be true, can it?”
Confidently, Qian Qin said, “Brother Yao, playing chess isn’t just about the current move, it’s about considering the next move. After the ‘Single Whip method’ and the National policies, there will undoubtedly be abundant goods, and surplus among the farmers. And what becomes of these surplus goods? Those surplus will be exchanged for silver, and people will purchase cloth and goods from traders. The Flourishing of merchant and traders are just in one or two years.”
“Zhang Bing, the Administration Commissioner in Beiping, lifted restrictions on merchants last year, boosting commerce. I’ve heard that the court is already preparing to implement the 1/15 commercial tax in Beiping. If Brother Yao dares to be a pioneer for the whole world, Suzhou Prefecture will surpass Beiping and become the foremost prefecture in our Ming Dynasty’s new commercial strategy.”
Yao Shan looked deeply at the letter. While these news might not be entirely accurate, they certainly weren’t baseless rumors.
If Beiping was indeed implementing the 1/15 tax, it wouldn’t be the end but just the beginning!
The Emperor had already accustomed the merchants in the capital and the Ministry of Revenue to the existence of the 1/15 tax through the two kings and the Arts Troupe. Although these taxes hadn’t been levied on the merchants in the capital, the Ministry of Revenue had already seen the benefits of increased taxation.
With the treasury overflowing and merchant profits unceasing, what could be better?
The Ministry of Revenue likely had no reason to oppose increased commercial taxation anymore.
Furthermore, the court had recently incorporated petty officials into the salary system. While this reduced the exploitation of the lower-class farmers by these officials, it also increased the court’s expenditure. It was reasonable to assume that when the court needed funds, implementing the new commercial strategy and increasing taxation on merchants would be a natural step.
If that were the case, would Suzhou Prefecture dare to be the first to implement this new commercial strategy?
And would he dare to push for the implementation of the new commercial strategy in Suzhou Prefecture?
Yao Shan looked at Wang Bin, Han Yi, and Yu Zhenmu. The three nodded slightly, indicating their support.
In the Kunning Palace in the capital.
Xu Miaojin held Zhu Wenkui in her arms, her face radiant with a smile. She occasionally glanced at Zhu Yunwen behind the desk, observing him intently reviewing her documents. This sight filled her with a sense of pride.
She had identified the issues with the Imperial Academy.

Chapter 90: Drawbacks of Bureaucratic Development Institution
The Imperial Academy, the highest educational institution of the Ming Dynasty.
Regarding the establishment of the Imperial Academy, Zhu Yuanzhang might not have had the mindset of “a hundred-year plan based on education,” but rather it was out of necessity.
The Ming Dynasty had conquered the world through military might, but ruling the realm with force alone was not sustainable.
Most of those who followed Zhu Yuanzhang to conquer the world were uneducated commoners, illiterate and unable to write official documents. Using them to govern the country, wouldn’t that be too challenging?
To govern a country effectively, bureaucrats are needed, and these bureaucrats must be literate. Those who can read and write are collectively referred to as literati. This is also why in many dynasties, as they developed, there emerged a phenomenon known as the “rise of culture and decline of military.”
Those who hold positions and provide ideas are often literati. As a rough and uncultured person, even if you have achieved military feats, you cannot compare to the influence of literati with their words and eloquence.
The problem is that Zhu Yuanzhang had a limited number of literati at his disposal. So, he brought over surviving former officials from the Yuan Dynasty, but that wasn’t enough. What could he do? He had to resort to appointing educated individuals who had never held official positions before.
However, these educated individuals also had concerns. During the early Ming Dynasty, the Northern Yuan was still a threat, and the stability of Zhu Yuanzhang’s rule was uncertain. They worried that hastily entering official positions, What if the Mongols launched another attack? That would likely result in retribution for their actions.
Zhu Yuanzhang invited them, but they stubbornly refused to come, infuriating old Zhu.
Fine, you won’t come, huh?
If you won’t serve as officials, then I’ll have you killed. Let’s see if you’ll come after that.
It’s truly a severe shortage of talent. Zhu Yuanzhang was at his wit’s end; he even enlisted granary officials into the bureaucracy, but that still wasn’t enough. This group of literati was causing him even more trouble.
With no other options left, Zhu Yuanzhang had to simultaneously promote the imperial examination system while establishing his own new bureaucracy.
And this new institution for bureaucratic training is known as Imperial Academy.
The Imperial Academy originally called the Imperial School, initially had no fixed location and conducted teachings in the main hall of the imperial palace. Later, Zhu Yuanzhang established the Imperial School to the south of Jiming Mountain. In the 15th year of the Hongwu era, it was officially transformed into the Imperial Academy.
To the Eastern of Imperial Academy is a small training ground, extending to the Yingling street(?)[1]Tl’s note: 英灵坊 in the west, reaching the City Slope Earthen Mound in the north, and spanning to the Pearl Bridge in the south. To the left, there is Longzhou Mountain, and to the right, there is Jiming Mountain. In the north lies Xuanwu Lake, and in the south, the Pearl River flows. Stretching for ten miles, the lights shine in harmony, portraying a vivid depiction of the grandeur of the early Ming Dynasty Imperial Academy
In the early Ming Dynasty, the Imperial Academy did indeed nurture a group of talents that could be utilized. However, this does not mean that the Imperial Academy was flawless.
Zhu Yunwen was aware of the significant issues in traditional education of ancient times, particularly the problems within the official school education during the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, he chose Xu Miaojin, a woman, to enter the Imperial Academy, which in itself was a silent confrontation and challenge to traditional official education.
Xu Miaojin lived up to Emperor Zhu Yunwen’s trust. She not only established her presence in the Imperial Academy but also garnered support from a large group of students by using the matter of the ‘national flag, national emblem, and national anthem’ as a foundation of the state.
After several months of observation and contemplation, Xu Miaojin completed the essay ‘Ten Major Ills of the Imperial Academy.’
Zhu Yunwen carefully read through each point, reaching the end of the document. He then looked back and reviewed it again, rereading it three times before finally raising his head to look at Xu Miaojin. He earnestly said, “This memorial should be recorded in the annals of history!”
Xu Miaojin smiled warmly and, holding onto Zhu Wenkui, walked towards Zhu Yunwen, asking, “Does this count as recognition and praise from the brother Emperor?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded seriously and said, “You have achieved great merit for the Ming Dynasty! These ten major ills of the Imperial Academy are exceedingly sharp, directly addressing the essence of the matter. In the future, with reforms and flourishing talents, you shall be recognized as a key contributor.”
Xu Miaojin’s face lit up with a radiant smile, brimming with joy.
After a few months of observation and contemplation, Xu Miaojin completed the memorandum ‘Ten Major Ills of the Imperial Academy.’
Zhu Yunwen lowered his head again and silently marveled at Xu Miaojin’s unique insights and acuity. After folding the memorandum, he said, “You stay here with the Empress. I need to discuss matters regarding the Imperial Academy with the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of Rites.”
“I also wish to go.” Xu Miaojin quickly said.
Ma Enhui held onto Xu Miaojin, detaining her, and said, “You’ve finally had the opportunity to enter the palace. Today, you are not allowed to go anywhere.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Miaojin’s pitiful expression and felt quite content.
Wu Ying Hall.
Grand Secretariat’s Yu Xin, Xie Jin, Zhang Dan, and the Minister of Rites, Chen Di, along with Hanlin attendant Yao Guangxiao, sat on both sides. After reviewing the memorandum ‘Ten Major Ills of the Imperial Academy,’ Chen Di returned the document and said, “Your Majesty, this memorandum indeed strikes at the heart of the issues within the Imperial Academy. However, some viewpoints are too biased, with aspects that are both valid and invalid.”
Zhu Yunwen lightly tapped the table with his fingers and asked, “What are the aspects that you find invalid, Minister Chen?”
Chen Di solemnly replied, “The memorandum mentions that the content taught in the Imperial Academy is currently limited to the Four Books, Five Classics, and relevant laws and regulations. It suggests expanding the curriculum to encompass agriculture, commerce, craftsmanship, and military affairs. With all due respect, the Imperial Academy is intended for selecting officials for the court, and its curriculum should align with the content of the imperial examinations. Expanding the curriculum without proper consideration will only burden the students.”
“Are you suggesting that students do not need to study knowledge beyond the Four Books and Five Classics?” Zhu Yunwen asked gently, with a hint of disappointment in his gaze.
Chen Di candidly responded, “Your Majesty, the schedules of the academy’s students are already full, leaving no time for additional studies.”
Zhu Yunwen closed his eyes slightly.
Speaking of the civil service examinations of later times, it was a competition where thousands trampled upon thousands. But who could have imagined that the education of the Ming Dynasty imperial examinations and official schools was even more examination-oriented, perhaps tens of times more so than the later civil service examinations!
To be clear, the imperial examinations tested the Four Books and Five Classics, and nothing beyond this scope was considered.
From the age of three, children memorized these few books. Any extracurricular reading was considered miscellaneous studies and not considered orthodox. What purpose would it serve?
Do they want to become walking encyclopedias?
Countless scholars of the Ming Dynasty, with their heads hanging and bodies bent over, struggled through their studies to unlock the mysteries of these books.
If you asked them how to respond to disasters, they would shake their heads, clueless. If you asked them what to do if they couldn’t fulfill the court’s mission, they would say they’d rather die with honor and find a place to end their lives.
Lacking adaptability, overly rigid, full of benevolence and virtue, yet utterly devoid of practical solutions.
This was the common malady of countless scholars!
The reason for these problems was that these individuals had been trapped in the Four Books and Five Classics for decades, never opening up their minds.
Why did Zhu Yunwen favor Xie Jin?
Because Xie Jin was adept at finding alternatives and had foresight.
Why did Zhu Yunwen value Yao Guangxiao?
Because this person had a wide range of knowledge, a lively mind, and many ideas.
There was also Yang Shiqi, recommended by Fang Xiaoru, a future member of the Cabinet whom Zhu Yunwen highly esteemed. Even though Yang Shiqi’s studies were rooted in the Four Books and Five Classics, he had roamed the world for a dozen or so years, dabbling in both the lawful and unlawful, understanding changes, and solving many problems.
But when you looked at the court, how many people truly understood adaptation?
Their adaptation was often a shift in position, not a change in thinking or ideology.
Even high-ranking officials like the Minister of Rites couldn’t recognize the problem of the Imperial Academy solely teaching the Four Books and Five Classics, and some even opposed the idea of adding other subjects. Could you really expect the old scholars of the Imperial Academy to accept this?
“Master Yao, what’s your opinion?” Zhu Yunwen opened his eyes and looked at Yao Guangxiao.
Yao Guangxiao stopped twirling his prayer beads and gazed at Zhu Yunwen, saying, “Your Majesty, the Imperial Academy teaches only the Four Books and Five Classics, which has its limitations. In my view, the teachings of the Four Books and Five Classics do not need to mimic the teachings of sages day and night. Instead, they should serve as auxiliary teachings, molding personal character and promoting an understanding of propriety, loyalty, and trust. Other subjects can be introduced in the Imperial Academy, focusing on the students’ experience in governance, matching talents with virtues – that’s the correct path.”

Chapter 91: No One Speaks for Zhu Xi
Yao Guangxiao did not hail from a conventional background in official education, so he can hardly be said to hold high regard for the Four Books and Five Classics. His interest in the teachings of Confucius, Mencius, and the Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism might even come after his interest in Buddhism.
Upon hearing Yao Guangxiao’s words, Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, Xie Jin, Chen Di, and others all furrowed their brows.
No need to treat it as word of sages, and listen to it day and night?
Isn’t this deviating from the original teachings?
Confucius and Mencius are revered as sages; this is a consensus among all scholars.
The reason why all of us stand here, enjoying power and glory, is precisely due to the teachings of these sages. You, Yao Guangxiao don’t acknowledge them as sages, we, the disciples of Confucius and Mencius, will not agree.
Yu Xin’s face turned dark, opposing, “Your Majesty, the Four Books and Five Classics embody the words of the sages. They cultivate one’s character, foster virtues, elucidate propriety, and illuminate the way for the people. They are the foundation of governance for our country, the backbone of the reading seeds of our Great Ming. They should be listened to day and night, studied diligently, and they should be the main focus, not supplementary.”
Zhang Dan glanced at Yao Guangxiao and said to Zhu Yunwen, “I concur. While the Imperial Academy may include other subjects, the Four Books and Five Classics should only be the main focus, not secondary. If we reverse their importance, neglecting their proper hierarchy, it will lead to calamity.”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips twitched slightly as he suppressed his underlying anger. He asked, “Xie Jin, what is your perspective?”
Xie Jin appeared visibly conflicted, being skilled at deducing the Emperor’s intentions.
Judging from Zhu Yunwen’s expression and tone, Xie Jin understood his thoughts quite clearly. It was apparent that Zhu Yunwen intended to introduce other subjects outside the Four Books and Five Classics, which would undoubtedly challenge the primacy of the latter.
To safeguard the status of the Four Books and Five Classics, Xie Jin needed to oppose Yao Guangxiao and Zhu Yunwen’s intentions.
However, Xie Jin had learned from the hardships and setbacks of the era of Zhu Yuanzhang that going against the boss could lead to a grim fate.
To preserve his position in the Grand Secretariat, he needed to stand behind Zhu Yunwen. Otherwise, Yao Guangxiao, who was standing on the sidelines, might easily replace him!”
Thinking this, Xie Jin resolved to speak out, saying, “Your Majesty, the Imperial Academy stands as the pinnacle of education in the Great Ming. The way of nurturing individuals should illuminate their foundation and display their capabilities. If we confine our teachings solely to the Four Books and Five Classics, excluding other subjects, it risks being one-sided. The officials produced might possess eloquence on paper but lack practical strategies for national advancement. I believe that reforms are needed in the curriculum of the Imperial Academy.”
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Chen Di stared at Xie Jin in surprise.
Chen Di could hardly contain his anger as he stepped closer to Xie Jin, speaking with a stern tone, “Scholar Xie, don’t forget that you also passed the imperial examination in the twenty-first year of the Hongwu Era with the knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics!”
Xie Jin’s expression remained unchanged as he continued, “We all entered officialdom through the Four Books and Five Classics, but may I ask, Minister Chen, do you not understand matters of agriculture, taxation, commerce, military strategy, astronomy, and astrology? If we’ve learned about these, then why can’t they be incorporated into the curriculum of the Imperial Academy? Emperor Taizu established the practice of “li shi” in the Imperial Academy, aiming to select talents for the nation.”
The term “li shi” referred to the period after Imperial Academy students completed six sessions of study, during which they engaged in practical affairs for a certain period of time. After this, they could register with the Ministry of Personnel and be placed on a list as reserve officials.
Chen Di wanted to retort, but Zhu Yunwen tapped on the table and said, “Debate is permissible, but not dispute. Since there’s controversy surrounding this matter, let’s set it aside for now. Are there any other issues with the remaining nine major ills?”
Yu Xin and the others shook their heads slightly.
In the memorandum ‘Ten Major Ills of the Imperial Academy,’ besides addressing the limited scope of subjects taught, it also raised concerns about excessive reverence for Zhu Xi’s annotations, difficulties for students in entering official positions, too lenient admission standards, excessive numbers of older students, and excessively strict assessments.
Reverence for Zhu Xi and treating his annotations as the words of a sage was the view of Zhu Yuanzhang.
The humble Zhu Yuanzhang wished he could have joined the Zhu Xi lineage, considering Zhu Xi an ancestor. Unfortunately, Zhu Xi had died a hundred years prior, and his descendants had a clear understanding of their bloodlines. Unable to impersonate, he had no choice but to give up.
Since bloodlines couldn’t merge, they would integrate spiritually.
Zhu Yuanzhang valued Zhu Xi and believed that Zhu Xi’s annotations on the Four Books and Five Classics were beneficial for his rule. He quickly integrated them into official teaching materials after making certain modifications. He even required everyone to emulate Zhu Xi’s interpretations when writing articles.
If one delves into Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism, Zhu Xi’s views, and gains some understanding of ancient texts, one wouldn’t use the phrase ‘maintain the principles of Heaven and eradicate human desires’ to criticize Zhu Xi.
The “Book of Rites: Book of Music” states, “That which transforms man and objects, eradicating the principles of Heaven and exhausting human desires.”
Zhu Xi’s advocated ‘maintain the principles of Heaven and eradicate human desires’ simply means that human desires exceeding fundamental needs, such as greed and selfishness, need to be eradicated. These excesses must be removed, allowing one to attain clarity and understanding of principles.
In simpler terms, Zhu Xi’s words can be summarized as: One’s desires should be moderated, not excessive.
However, among the Chinese, there’s a habit of taking sentences out of context, hand-copying passages, and using half a phrase as the full essence, which is quite common.
Later generations would look at it and say, ‘Oh, this restricts freedom, devoid of humanity, let’s criticize it.’
Zhu Yuanzhang would think, ‘Not bad, this keeps people disciplined and restricts various types of ideas from scholars, creating a group of obedient people. What’s the problem?’
Before the Ming Dynasty, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism was relatively open, advocating that ‘teachers don’t need to be wiser than their students, and students don’t need to be inferior to their teachers.’ It encouraged innovation and surpassing boundaries.
But under Zhu Yuanzhang, innovation? Breaking boundaries?
What was that?
Zhu Xi said something, and that something became the absolute truth. Whoever dared to babble nonsense wouldn’t have a chance to become an official.
To put it in an analogy, before the Ming Dynasty, scholars could describe a ‘willow tree’ as ‘branches flutter like spring breezes, tender as gold, soft as silk,’ or ‘chaotic twigs not yet turned pale yellow, leaning with the momentum of the east wind.’
But after Zhu Yuanzhang’s era, scholars could only write:
Oh, that’s a willow tree.
There was no other way. Zhu Xi’s interpretations made it so; a willow tree it was. You’re wrong if you consider a willow tree as a woman, and you’re wrong if you consider it wild and impetuous.
If you’re wrong, don’t expect to pass the imperial examination.
Speaking on behalf of the sage’s words leaves no room for free interpretation.
In theory, Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, Xie Jin, and Chen Di should have upheld Zhu Xi, but Zhu Yunwen hadn’t seen anyone opposing his viewpoint.
Xie Jin and others spoke for Confucius and Mencius, but they wouldn’t speak for Zhu Xi. This was because while Zhu Xi had great influence, it wasn’t enough to earn the unreserved respect and allegiance of these scholars.
Is Zhu Xi’s interpretation always right?
We’ve also studied the Four Books and Five Classics, can’t we interpret them with our own understanding?
We’re all literati; if you’re capable, come out from the earth. Let’s compare our knowledge!
Furthermore, the rule about representing the sage’s words had only been in place for a little over a decade (the Hongwu Emperor began the imperial examinations in the early years of his reign, then suspended them for a decade). It hadn’t formed strong enough recognition and momentum yet.
“Since you all have no objections, but I have one question.” Zhu Yunwen took a deep breath, stood up, and gazed at everyone with intense eyes, asking, ‘Why is there a Japanese student at the Imperial Academy?'”



---


Chapter 92: It seems that Your Majesty really despises Japan.
In the Ming Dynasty, students of the Imperial Academy can be divided into two categories: civilian students and official students.
Civilian students are those from ordinary families.
Official students refer to those born in official families, including five types: the sons of titled officials, examinee students (举监) , noble students for education, sons of local officials, and foreign exchange students.
Sons of titled officials are also called ‘Yin Jian.’ The sons of officials from the first to the seventh rank can directly enter the Imperial Academy as students due to their father’s rank.
Examinee students are Juren[1]Juren (Chinese: 舉人; lit. ‘recommended man’) was a rank achieved by people who passed the xiangshi (Chinese: 鄉試) exam in the imperial … Continue reading
For instance, if Zhang San is already a Juren, but didn’t pass this year’s examination, he might think, ‘If I return home, it will take three months to get back and forth. I might as well study at the Imperial Academy for three years.’
Noble students for education are easier to understand. Even the sons of prince consort, marquises, dukes, need to attend school, right?
Sons of local officials, here referring to chieftains, are often officials in border minority regions, such as the Wusa Prefecture in Yunnan, the Mangbu prefecture, the Bozhou Prefecture in Sichuan, and the Xuanwei Prefecture in Guizhou, where there are also many local chieftains.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang nominally ruled over these areas, they could be considered semi-autonomous states. The central government’s control and management over these areas were not strong. When dealing with matters, negotiations with the local chieftains were often necessary.
There were foreign exchange students at the Ming Dynasty’s Imperial Academy, mainly from Goryeo, Japan, Ryukyu, and Siam.
In the fourth year of the Hongwu Emperor’s reign, Goryeo’s Jin Tao, Pu Shi, and Liu Boru participated in the imperial examination, and Jin Tao passed the exam become Jinshi.
In the twenty-second year of the Hongwu Emperor’s reign, Japan’s Tengyou and others entered the Imperial Academy.
In the twenty-fifth year of the Hongwu Emperor’s reign, the Ryukyu Kingdom’s King Zhongshan dispatched exchange students to the Ming Dynasty.
In his daily life, Zhu Yunwen mainly focused on state affairs, such as taxes, land, and military organization, and didn’t pay much attention to the Imperial Academy. If not for Xu Miaojin’s mention, he would have thought that all the students at the Imperial Academy were Chinese.
There were even Japanese students right under his nose?
“Uh? Your Majesty, is there anything wrong with this?”
Chen Di looked at the furious Zhu Yunwen, his tone uneasy.
The vast Ming Dynasty, the vast expanse of China, accepting a few foreign students to showcase the grandeur of the Ming Dynasty, was there anything wrong with that?
Zhu Yunwen slammed the table and stared fiercely!
Chen Di and the others trembled in fear, quickly kneeling down.
Everyone was confused. What’s wrong with the Japanese exchange students?
When those Japanese pirates killed some soldiers and civilians along the coast last time, you sent a large fleet over. Do you know that because of your orders, the Ming Dynasty Navy, with over thirty thousand people, is currently patrolling the East China Sea, killing people?
Zheng He has already killed more than twenty pirate leaders and over a thousand pirates, it’s said that not a single one was left alive. They were all beheaded.
Who knew if there were still pirates at sea?
In the end, the Japanese pirates were dead men walking.
But Your Majesty, these Japanese official students are sent by the Japanese authorities, you should show them some face.
Moreover, Japanese students were usually diligent, polite, and well-mannered, and hadn’t committed any wrongdoing. So why be so angry with them?
Looking at Chen Di and the others kneeling on the ground, Zhu Yunwen also felt helpless.
What should he say?
The current Japanese pirates are only small bands, not yet large and daring enough to launch a massive attack on the Ming Dynasty, and they aren’t large enough to devour Korea. Moreover, he couldn’t tell them about events a thousand years in the future.
Telling them that the Japanese people are inherently bloodthirsty, savage, warmongering, and evil creatures—these people wouldn’t believe it.
“Starting today, send the Japanese official students back to Japan. Great Ming will no longer accept Japanese students! Also, inform the coastal guard stations that Japanese is not allowed to set foot on Chinese territory! If Japanese envoys come, send them back without letting them disembark! Reform the Imperial Academy, and all of you, come up with a plan as soon as possible!”
After saying this, Zhu Yunwen turned and left.
Chen Di and the others exchanged puzzled looks, unable to understand Zhu Yunwen’s odd orders.
“Your Majesty seems to strongly despise Japan.”
Xie Jin murmured, deep in thought.
Chen Di and the others nodded in agreement.
Anything related to Japan made Zhu Yunwen seem like he wanted to tear them apart, as if the Japanese had wronged him.
But how could the Japanese people possibly harm the Ming Emperor?
They hadn’t even had a chance to see Zhu Yunwen!
Yao Guangxiao continued to twirl his prayer beads, saying, “Although the problem with Japanese pirates is small, if not dealt with sternly, it may lead to great calamity. Your Majesty’s concerns are for the long term and beyond our speculation.”
Chen Di and the others sighed. After all, there were only a few Japanese students. Just drive them away.
As for the reasons, that was easy. Let’s use ‘insufficient fluency in Chinese, please return to your home country.’
As soon as Zhu Yunwen returned to the Kunning Palace, Xu Miaojin eagerly approached and asked, “Brother Emperor, has the Grand Secretariat and Ministry of Rites agreed to reform the Imperial Academy?”
“You know, His Majesty seems a bit tired,” Ma Enhui reproached Xu Miaojin, handing a cup of tea to Zhu Yunwen and saying with concern, “Your Majesty, do you need to rest?”
“What about Wenkui?”
Zhu Yunwen looked around but didn’t see Zhu Wenkui’s figure.
“Consort Ning took him away.”
Ma Enhui smiled and explained.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and turned to Xu Miaojin, saying, “You want to establish a women’s academy, but you might need to delay it a bit. Let’s wait a few more months.”
“Why?”
Xu Miaojin asked, puzzled.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and explained, “The current single whip method and curbing land consolidation are in progress. There’s too much government affairs. If we establish a women’s academy at this time, it’s likely to stir up controversy. There are many officials, and they all have their opinions. I only have one mouth.”
In this moment, Xu Miaojin suddenly felt that Zhu Yunwen was somewhat helpless, somewhat vulnerable. He seemed like himself, unsure of what to do, enduring hardship.
Although he was the Emperor, he was still a human being.
Xu Miaojin knew that His Majesty wouldn’t be bothered by the controversies of the officials.
However, when the women’s academy was established, the officials’ criticism might not be directed at His Majesty, but at herself.
Zhu Yunwen hoped to free up more energy, introduce the women’s academy at the right time, and then protect herself.
Xu Miaojin lowered his head, pondered for a moment, then lifted his head and said, “Your Majesty, if the women’s academy is postponed, I have no objections. However, I hope it won’t be delayed for too long. After all, women can’t wait.”
In ancient times, women married early, usually between the ages of thirteen and nineteen. Anyone over twenty was considered a late marriage.
If a women’s academy was established, only those who were already married or close to marriage could participate, such as the daughters of noble families and officials in the capital.
For unmarried women, it was still manageable, they had some freedom.
But for those who were already married, everything would be subject to their husbands’ decisions. How many husbands would allow their wives to attend a school and study subjects beyond household management?
Xu Miaojin knew that throughout the long history, there were only a few brief mentions of women.
Lacking talent, all she wanted was to make a small contribution with her life.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware of this, after a moment of contemplation, he promised, “I promise you, no later than the second half of the year, we will definitely have the women’s academy established this year.”
Xu Miaojin sincerely saluted Zhu Yunwen.
Looking at the earnest pair, Ma Enhui shook her head slightly and said, “Now that things are settled, it’s good. Shuangxi, bring in the meal. Miaojin, you don’t need to leave the palace today. Stay here and accompany me properly.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui, silently asking: If she stays here, where do I go?



---


Chapter 93: The issue of Two Hands
Unjust, he was driven out.
Outside the gate of Kunning Palace, Zhu Yunwen helplessly said to Shuangxi, “Go to Chengqian Palace.”
Ma Enhui’s actions carried profound implications.
Zhu Yunwen, as the Emperor of Ming Dynasty, currently only has one son, Zhu Wenkui, the bloodline is too thin.
For the imperial family, this is not a favorable situation.
Furthermore, Zhu Yunwen excessively favors Ma Enhui and often stays at Kunning Palace. Neither Consort Ning, consort Xian, nor Lady Luo has ever been hosted overnight. If this continue, When will Zhu Yunwen’s lineage be able to grow and thrive if this continues?
Zhu Yunwen is well aware of Ma Enhui’s subtle intentions.
However, the moral constraints etched into his soul prevent him from taking that step.
Moreover, he is not familiar with Consort Ning, consort Xian, and Lady Luo. If he rashly indulges in a relationship, wouldn’t that be acting like a rogue?
The sound of weaving in the Chengqian Palace was light and rhythmic.
Luo Yan’er was inspecting new medical gauze and recording the details when she saw Zhu Yunwen approaching. She quickly bowed in greeting.
Seeing that the room was a bit stuffy, Zhu Yunwen said, “Let’s take a stroll.”
Luo Yan’er handed her tasks to her maidservant and followed Zhu Yunwen out of the Chengqian Palace.
As the night grew deeper, the stars became brighter.
The gentle spring breeze brushed against Luo Yan’er’s hair, bringing a soft smile to her lips. She stole a glance at Zhu Yunwen beside her, who seemed lost in thought.
Despite the silence, there was no awkwardness, but a hint of unexplainable nervousness.
“Why is Lady Luo smiling?” Zhu Yunwen suddenly asked.
Luo Yan’er looked surprised. He hadn’t seen her smiling, yet he knew she was?
“Your Majesty seems to be in a good mood, and naturally, your humble concubine is happy too,” Luo Yan’er replied, looking towards the distant palace.
Zhu Yunwen stopped and turned to face the starry sky. “If I were to get angry, wouldn’t Lady Luo burst into tears?”
Luo Yan’er pouted slightly and said, “I wouldn’t. I’d probably just tremble with fear and forget how to cry.”
Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter, looking at Luo Yan’er and saying with satisfaction, “You’re quite something, truly talented.”
Luo Yan’er took a step forward with a coy smile. “Your Majesty is the truly learned one. I’m just displaying a bit of superficial knowledge.”
Zhu Yunwen gestured towards a pavilion not far away and said, “Let’s sit for a while.”
The peonies outside the pavilion were in full bloom, filling the air with a delicate fragrance.
“On behalf of all the palace maids from the Laundry service, I thank Your Majesty,” Luo Yan’er said with a respectful bow.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand. “If you want to thank someone, thank the Empress. This matter has nothing to do with me.”
Luo Yan’er smiled lightly and said, “But I’ve heard that outsourcing was Your Majesty’s idea. I come from the Laundry service and know that it’s a place of hardship. The Laundry service’s escape from adversity relies entirely on the grace of Your Majesty and the Empress. They will certainly work diligently in gratitude, not letting down such heavenly favor.”
Zhu Yunwen also sighed. He had only mentioned the idea of outsourcing, yet Ma Enhui had actually brought it to fruition.
However, considering the security of the royal clothing, Ma Enhui had kept a small-scale laundry within the Laundry service, responsible for washing the clothes of the Emperor, Empress, and consorts. Other royal garments were all handed over to the external Laundry service, under stricter supervision.
The location of the external Laundry Bureau had been chosen in the abandoned music office. Its workforce consisted of widows and spinsters from the capital.
Many soldiers died during the early Ming wars, resulting in numerous widowed women. Among them, many had lost both their husbands and sons, left without support. They could only barely get by through textile work and clothing repairs.
In the name of the imperial harem, Empress Ma Enhui recruited widows and spinsters into the inner palace for lighter tasks, providing them with a monthly stipend. This move not only cared for the disadvantaged group but also gained popularity among the common people. Even the usually critical Censorate sent several memorials praising the Empress for her motherly image and thoughtful care.
In this way, the Laundry service was essentially reorganized through outsourcing. Although the Laundry service wasn’t officially disbanded, most of its rooms had been transformed into weaving workshops and storage areas.
Due to its location outside the palace, the transportation of goods to and from the Laundry service became more convenient, saving a considerable amount of manpower.
The current production of medical gauze, jointly produced by Chengqian Palace, Jingyang Palace, Yonghe Palace, Yanxi Palace, the Laundry service, and the Two King’s Residence, amounted to nearly 600 boxes per day. Over 1,600 palace maids participated in the production daily.
If it weren’t for the fact that some civilian merchants still have petroleum, the supply of Vaseline would likely have been cut off.
Additionally, the merchant caravans, upon learning that the price of petroleum was high in the capital, saw profit potential. They purchased it at a low price from other provinces and counties and then sold it at a higher price in the capital, which ensured a stable petroleum supply.
Profiteering and the distribution of goods was, in essence, a simple market resource allocation.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t need to conscript labor or military force to transport petroleum from the border or areas like Shanxi. The merchants helped him complete all of this, and he only needed to pay a certain amount of silver.
A gentle night breeze stirred, dispersing Zhu Yunwen’s thoughts.
He looked at Luo Yan’er beside him and softly said, “Actually, they should be most grateful to you. It was your hands that moved me, your wisdom that gave them an opportunity.”
Luo Yan’er looked at Zhu Yunwen, and her smile bloomed on her face like a spring flower—graceful and captivating.
The next day, after having her morning meal, Ma Enhui asked Shuangxi, “Where did the Emperor spend the night yesterday?”
Shuangxi looked at Ma Enhui with a bitter expression and replied, “Answering Your Majesty, the Emperor spent the night at the Jinsen Hall.”
“The Jinsen Hall?”
Ma Enhui furrowed her brows and sighed softly, not saying anything further.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the memorial from the Suzhou Prefect, Yao Shan, with surprise. He hadn’t expected that there would be someone daring to pioneer changes for the entire nation within Ming Dynasty.
The Beiping Administration Commissioner, Zhang Bing, had lifted the ban on merchants, and despite the opposition of the court officials, who were somewhat alarmed by the news, he hinted that he intended to implement new commercial policies in the Beiping Prefecture. This included adopting a tax rate of 1/15 on commercial activities. To everyone’s surprise, Zhang Bing did not oppose it, and even the merchants themselves didn’t raise any objections. As a result, the court began to stir once again.
Zhu Yunwen was wondering how to introduce reforms to the commercial tax and convince the court officials, now Yao Shan’s memorial arrived just in time, like a timely rain.
“Summon Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, and Xia Yuanji.”
Zhu Yunwen felt delighted.
Xie Jin and Huang Zicheng had read the copied content of Yao Shan’s memorial and had guessed that Zhu Yunwen would summon them. However, they didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.
Zhu Yunwen straightforwardly asked, “What are your opinions on the Suzhou Prefecture’s intention to trial new commercial policies?”
Huang Zicheng, being the Minister of Revenue, was the first to respond, “Your Majesty, the new commercial policies alter the low tax rate of 1/30 that was set during the Taizu period. Could implementing a 1/15 tax on commercial activities in Suzhou Prefecture harm the merchants’ profits? Moreover, if Suzhou Prefecture enacts a 1/15 tax rate while Songjiang Prefecture, Jiaxing Prefecture, Huzhou Prefecture, and Changzhou Prefecture remain at 1/30, would it not cause Suzhou Prefecture to become a high-tax area, driving away its merchants?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly. Huang Zicheng had indeed put in effort in the Ministry of Revenue; raising these two points indicated that he had studied the matter in depth.
The operation of commerce followed an invisible hand with its own rules.
On the other hand, government control was like a tangible hand. If this hand was extended, policies would be the thumb, and taxation the index finger.
Whether the merchants stayed or left depended on how well the thumb and index finger could control them.

Chapter 94: Urgent Report – Jiangxi Planning to Rebel?
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xia Yuanji and inquired, “Minister Xia, in your opinion, how much harm would increasing the business tax cause?”
Xia Yuanji’s gaze was steadfast as he looked at Zhu Yunwen, and he solemnly replied, “Your Majesty, by lifting the ban on merchants and allowing them the freedom to conduct trade, lies great potential for profit. Although the shift from a business tax rate of 1/30 to 1/15 seems like a significant increase, like the single whip method, this is akin to merging multiple taxes into one. Upon careful calculation, the actual increase in business tax revenue would be quite limited. I believe it is feasible.”
If one were to simply view the tax rate on businesses during the Ming Dynasty, it could be argued that it was relatively low compared to other historical periods.
However, upon deeper examination, this perspective might not hold.
Zhu Yuanzhang initially set the business tax rate at 1/30, which was already lower from the 1/20 rate during the Yuan Dynasty.
If you were doing business during the Ming Dynasty and sold goods worth ten taels of silver, the nominal business tax would appear to be just over three hundred wen.
But is it really so?
Perhaps not.
Keep in mind that while conducting business, you often have to travel through various regions. If you want to enter a city, you need to pay a city gate tax. If you’re traveling by water, you might have to pay boat passage tolls or boat fees.
If you get tired and decide to rest at an official inn for a couple of days, that also comes with a tax.
If you want to sell goods in a particular place, you usually need a shopfront. Even if you’re selling something as small as chicken feathers with a small basket, it still occupies space, doesn’t it?
This requires you to pay a market stall tax.
And what if you feel that your goods are too much to display all at once and need to be stored in a warehouse? Well, that’s subject to a storage tax.
And if your goods aren’t selling well, no problem. You can approach a trading firm (牙行) to help facilitate the trade, but guess who’s footing the trading firm tax? You get the idea.
Although the early Ming Dynasty’s business taxes weren’t numerous and the types of taxes weren’t complex, as the Ming Dynasty developed, the volume of business taxes increased. By the time Zhu Yunwen was ruling, multiple layers of taxes had been introduced at some checkpoints to maximize tax collection.
And the revenue from these business taxes wouldn’t necessarily make it into the national treasury.
Xia Yuanji knew very well that the new commercial policy wasn’t just about five words; it involved a series of tax cancellations and regulations. For instance, the new commercial policy directly abolished the city gate tax. This might seem insignificant, but for merchants, this was a huge benefit.
For example, when a guard inspects your goods and decides there’s an issue, denying you entry into the city, you’re at a loss and must comply, paying up and being courteous.
Furthermore, city gate taxes lack consistency; they can be very arbitrary. Today, you might be charged fifty wens, while tomorrow it could be three hundred wens.
Completely abolishing them is a great boon for merchants.
And there are more improvements in the new commercial policy. It not only cancels the city gate tax but also regulates the tolls paid at checkpoints, removing trading firm taxes, and the like. These policies, once enacted, won’t make Suzhou Prefecture a high-tax area. Instead, it will become a haven for low-tax commerce!
At that point, Suzhou prefecture’s commercial prosperity would be inevitable, causing neighboring regions to follow suit. Eventually, the new commercial tax policy of the Ming Dynasty would be fully implemented.
Xie Jin suggested to Zhu Yunwen, “Since Suzhou prefecture has the courage to implement this, give them a chance to try it out and assess the results. Then we can decide whether to expand it to both capital and the thirteen provinces.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “I have granted Yao Shan’s request. However, it shouldn’t be limited to Suzhou Prefecture alone. Beiping prefecture’s Zhang Bing and others have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. The merchants have been eager as well. It might be wise to implement the new commercial policy simultaneously in the south and north.”
Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, and Xia Yuanji all answered in unison.
After confirming the new commercial policies for both the south and north regions,  Zhu Yunwen shifted his gaze towards the policy of preventing the land consolidation and inquired, “I’ve heard that the implementation of the consolidation policy has been relatively smooth in Jiangsu and Zhejiang region, but in Jiangxi, there have been obstacles and slow progress. How do you view this?”
“Your Majesty, Jiangxi has many local gentry, and the quantity of land holdings to be consolidated is quite substantial. While the progress is slow, there haven’t been significant disruptions so far.”
Xie Jin replied promptly.
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and said solemnly, “The presence of numerous local gentry is not an excuse to resist the policy. These individuals are exceedingly greedy, with significant financial resources at their disposal. If unrest were to arise, the consequences would be unimaginable. I intends to give them a warning.”
“A warning?”
Xie Jin and the others exchanged glances, somewhat puzzled.
Zhu Yunwen nodded earnestly and continued, “Liu Chen, as the provincial administration commissioner of Jiangxi, has not performed his duties well. He will be demoted to advisor position, and Lu Yi, the Left Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, will replace Liu Chen and oversee the implementation of the land consolidation policy in Jiangxi. What are your thoughts?”
“Your Majesty, Liu Chen has always been loyal and capable. The slow progress of the policy is due to various reasons. However, if his demotion leads to further complications, it might be difficult to maintain stability.”
Huang Zicheng expressed his concerns.
Xie Jin chuckled and addressed Huang Zicheng, “Minister Huang, you worry too much. His Majesty’s decision is advantageous. Firstly, it will serve as a warning to officials at all levels in Jiangxi. If they fail to diligently implement the policy, the next official to be demoted could be them. Secondly, once Jiangxi successfully implements the policy and Lu Yi returns, Liu Chen will still hold his position as the provincial administration commissioner in Jiangxi. This way, no harm is done.”
“Your Majesty?”
Huang Zicheng looked towards Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and smiled, saying, “Exactly so.”
Huang Zicheng agreed, “In that case, I have no objections.”
Zhu Yunwen’s brow furrowed, and he said, “Jiangxi is facing difficulties, and I am well aware of it. Some criticize me, and I am also aware of that. But there’s no other way. For the sake of the prosperity of Great Ming and its people, I cannot afford not to promote the national policy!”
“Is Your Majesty concerned about instability in Jiangxi?”
Xie Jin keenly sensed something and asked in a low voice.
Upon hearing this, both Huang Zicheng and Xia Yuanji looked at Zhu Yunwen with surprise.
If Xie Jin’s speculation was correct, then Zhu Yunwen would undoubtedly take additional measures, rather than simply replacing the administration commissioner.
Zhu Yunwen nodded gravely and said, “The local gentry in Jiangxi may not be willing to part with their interests so easily.”
Xie Jin and the others looked a bit bitter at the corners of their mouths. It was true; while it’s easy for people to want to take money out of someone else’s pocket, no one wants their own pockets to be emptied.
“Your Majesty, Liu Changge from the Bureau of Security seeks an audience.”
Shuangxi quickly reported.
“Oh? Let him in.” Zhu Yunwen said.
Liu Changge swiftly entered and, after saluting, said solemnly, “Your Majesty, an urgent report from the Raozhou branch of the Bureau of Security in Jiangxi. Affluent families in Raozhou have covertly formed connections with local factions, intending to resist the consolidation policy. The individuals involved in this plot number more than three hundred.”
“Haha, good!”
Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter, enraged.
Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, and Xia Yuanji were all taken aback.
Could it be that the local gentry in Jiangxi are plotting a rebellion?
“Summon Ru Chang, Liu Jun, Xu Huizu, Zhu Di, and Song Cheng!”
Zhu Yunwen’s voice became stern.
Shuangxi acknowledged and hurriedly left.
Xie Jin took the report from Liu Changge’s hands, his brow furrowed.
If this were true, it couldn’t be taken lightly. While the consolidation policy impacted the interests of the gentry, in the long run, it was designed to protect those interests. After all, the court didn’t prohibit land transactions, but merely increased requirements and regulations to ensure fair land deals.
As long as these gentry were willing to buy and sell land fairly, their land holdings would still grow, and taxes still needed to be paid.
Even so, they were still benefitting. They shouldn’t be resisting the consolidation policy, let alone rebelling.
Relying solely on their gang of ruffians and hoodlums, they dare to confront the court?
Even without deploying the imperial army, the local garrisons under the command of the regional authorities are enough to crush them.
What are these people thinking?
The court merely intends to slice a piece of meat from them, but they insist on extending their necks. If a blow is struck, it won’t just be a matter of a piece of meat anymore…”

Chapter 95: Zhu Yunwen’s deceptive strategy
In the Jinshen hall, a sense of solemn killing intent permeated the air as eunuchs and palace maids outside the gates treaded cautiously, fearing to make any noise.
Xu Huizu’s gaze was filled with anger as he stared intently, his voice raised, “Your Majesty, Jiangxi gentry dare to do this, I request the deployment of our troops to march to Raozhou!”
Ru Chang furrowed his brows and objected, “The findings of the Security Bureau only indicate signs, not actual rebellion. Deploying our forces hastily would not only be a drain on resources and manpower but also detrimental to the implementation of our national policies. In my humble opinion, it should suffice to send a directive to Jiangxi Provincial Commander to exert influence and deter the locals, achieving victory without combat.”
“Minister Ru, do the words ‘signs’ not suffice to prove their rebellious intent? What if they gather thousands and publicly rebel, waving banners and shouting slogans? How about deploying the military then to suppress the turmoil?” Zhu Di said sternly.
Ru Chang’s expression darkened, but he did not retort.
Zhu Di was not only a king but also one of the few seasoned commanders of the Ming Dynasty.
His words carried considerable weight.
Zhu Di turned to Zhu Yunwen and said solemnly, “Your Majesty, Jiangxi is a vital source of taxation, and it must not fall into chaos. If the gentry wishes to defy the court, then the military should be dispatched to quell their resistance. I am willing to lead a thousand soldiers to Raozhou and enforce the national policies in the countryside.”
Ru Chang was extremely frustrated and sighed inwardly.
Even if there was some commotion in the region, it shouldn’t warrant you Zhu Di’s personal intervention, right?
Furthermore, they haven’t even resorted to violence yet, and you’re sending troops over already. Is it kill or not kill?
Once bloodshed starts, what becomes of the prosperity we’re aiming for?
Isn’t a prosperous era all about having enough to eat and drink, without readily losing one’s head?
However, there was no way around it. The Ministry of War still couldn’t outdo the authority of the Five Army Commandery. Xu Huizu, Zhu Di, and Song Cheng were all proponents of military action, while Grand Secretariat’s Xie Jin was clearly aligned with the Emperor’s viewpoint.
With a worried expression, Zhu Yunwen pondered for a long time before finally making a decision, saying, “Although the Jiangxi Provincial Commander has the authority to handle this matter, it concerns national policies and should not be taken lightly with military intervention. It would be best for the court to send troops. Uncle Yan should remain stationed to oversee the reforms in military. It would be imprudent for him to be far away. In my view, we shall appoint He Fu to lead three thousand men to Raozhou.”
Xu Huizu, Zhu Di, and Song Cheng were somewhat disappointed. Such a favorable opportunity slipped through their fingers.
“In that case, all of you withdraw. Let He Fu enter the hall. I have personal instructions to give.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, and Xu Huizu and the others left the hall.
In the Grand Secretariat,
Xie Jin informed Yu Xin and Zhang Dan about the court’s decision to deploy troops to Jiangxi.
Yu Xin was astonished and quickly asked, “The Jiangxi gentry are trying to rebel? Is that even possible?”
Zhang Dan also looked skeptical; the news was too sudden.
Xie Jin furrowed his brows and said, “This information was obtained through investigations by the Security Bureau. It’s hard to determine its authenticity. But from recent reports about Jiangxi, while there is resistance and opposition from the gentry, there’s no evidence of outright defiance against the court.”
Zhang Dan took a report, said “Jiangxi administration commissioner Liu Chen’s report mentioned that there are many among the gentry resisting the national policies, but their actions mostly amount to delaying and non-cooperation. There’s no mention of any region daring to directly oppose the court. Since Your Majesty ascended the throne, freedom of speech has been encouraged. If there were issues in the localities, they could be reported. Liu Chen had no reason to cover up for the region.”
Taking a seat and pouring himself a cup of tea, Xie Jin said, “This matter is strange precisely for this reason. Gentry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are well aware that national policies must be carried out without deviation. Thoroughly implement it is the only way; resistance would lead to a dead end. Why is it that when it comes to Jiangxi, these gentry fail to comprehend?”
“Ah, let’s hope that His Majesty can restrain He Fu and avoid a massacre.”
Yu Xin let out a sigh.
Xie Jin nodded slightly, realizing that his hopes could only rest upon the Emperor now.
In the Jinshen hall, He Fu paid his respects.
Zhu Yunwen looked at He Fu. Although he was nearing fifty, he appeared to be in his early forties, exuding an imposing aura. However, his face bore a scar resembling a long insect’s trail, evoking fear in those who looked upon it.
“He Fu, if I remember correctly, you are also from Fengyang?” Zhu Yunwen asked in a soft voice.
He Fu’s heart warmed, and he replied, “Indeed, Your Majesty, I am from Fengyang.”
Fengyang in Anhui, the place where the dragon rises.
Zhu Yunwen smiled, “It seems that you, I, and the Founding Emperor are distant relatives.”
He Fu quickly responded, “I wouldn’t dare make such a claim, Your Majesty.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and then turned serious. He said, “In the early years of the Hongwu era, due to your merits, you were promoted to the position of Commandant of the Imperial Guards. Later, you accompanied Duke Ying, Fu Youde, on the expedition to Yunnan, and you were promoted to the position of Deputy Commander of the Front Army Commandery. In the twentieth year of Hongwu, you followed Duke Liang, Lan Yu, in attacking the Northern Yuan outside the border and achieved a great victory in Battle of Buir Lake. In the twenty-fourth year of Hongwu, you participated in quelling the rebellion of A Zi, the leader of the rebel forces in Yuezhou.”
“In the third month of the thirtieth year of Hongwu, West water tribe Zong Bideng rebellion were pacified under your command. In November, as Left General for Conquering the Barbarians, you joined Marquis Xiping, Mu Chun, to suppress the rebel tribe led by Dao Gangmeng in Luchuan. You surrendered seventy thousand of their forces, bringing Luchuan under control! Am I correct?”
He Fu was deeply moved, nearly shedding tears. How could he deserve such recognition in the vast affairs of the Ming Dynasty? Yet the Emperor remembered his deeds!
“Your Majesty, this is the duty of a subject.”
With red eyes, He Fu shouted.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “I remember your contributions and understand that you are weary. This time, after coming from Yunnan to the capital for rewards and titles, I have a task for you. You will need to leave the capital for some time. Are you willing?”
He Fu replied solemnly, “I am willing to follow Your Majesty’s command even to death!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Very well, He Fu obey my orders.”
“Here I am!”
He Fu knelt on one knee.
Zhu Yunwen spoke sternly, “I order you to lead three thousand elite soldiers to Jiangxi, specifically to Guangxin, Raozhou, and Wannian. The official mission is to suppress local unrest and enforce the national policies, but in reality…”
He Fu widened his eyes, looking at Zhu Yunwen’s triumphant smile, and couldn’t help but shiver.
Could it be that there was no rebellion in Jiangxi, and this was all a scheme devised by the Emperor?
“Do you understand?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
He Fu exclaimed, “I promise to complete the mission!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Attend court tomorrow, and three days later, proceed up the Yangtze River. Pass through Poyang Lake and enter Raozhou. The rest of the details, I entrust to you.”
He Fu issued his military order, “If I fail to complete the mission, I shall apologize with my life!”
“Haha, it won’t be that severe. However, you must remember, this matter is to be kept secret, and no word of it should leak.” Zhu Yunwen exhorted.
He Fu readily agreed.
The next day’s court assembly, Zhu Yunwen issued an edict, bestowing upon He Fu the title of Marquis of Ningyuan. He was ordered to depart from Jiangxi and oversee the local areas. Simultaneously, a message was sent to the Jiangxi Regional Command, granting them the authority to handle obstructions caused by local gentry towards the Land Assessment team and the Agricultural Tax office.
With the change in Jiangxi’s administration commissioner as well, the court officials now clearly recognized Zhu Yunwen’s determination to implement the national policies. They had to put aside their critical memorials.
After several months of acquaintance, everyone had come to understand Zhu Yunwen better. Although he was kind and receptive to the advice of his ministers, he held strong opinions. Once he set his mind on something, he would not consider it complete until it was thoroughly implemented.
At this point, advocating for those gentry, attacking national policies, could very likely lead to being stripped of one’s official hat and donning a bamboo hat, going to conduct land assesment.
Compared to the small benefits offered by those gentry, one’s official position was far more crucial.
Three days later, He Fu set out. Not only did he lead three thousand elite soldiers, but he also brought along three hundred craftsmen. He even took twenty personnel from the Gunpowder Bureau. Riding the eastern wind, he sailed upstream along the Yangtze River, heading straight for Poyang Lake…

Chapter 96: New Furnaces and the Challenges of Innovation
Kunning Palace
Ma Enhui was playing with Zhu Wenkui, accompanied by palace maids and eunuchs, enjoying themselves.
Just at that moment, a eunuch approached and reported, “Your Majesty, the Seal holding eunuch of the Palace Armament Bureau has arrived.”
“Oh? I don’t recall summoning the Palace Armament Bureau. Why have they come to Kunning Palace?” Ma Enhui was somewhat puzzled.
“I instructed them to come,” Zhu Yunwen said as he walked into Kunning Palace. The people present all knelt down, Ma Enhui gave a slight bow, and she saw the eunuch from the Palace Armament Bureau kneeling outside, paying his respects. On the ground, there were also something covered in red cloth.
“Bring the items inside,” Zhu Yunwen said softly.
Seal-holding eunuch Liang Xiu from the palace armament bureau quickly ordered his subordinates to carry the items, carefully bringing them into the main hall of Kunning Palace.
Zhu Wenkui walked up to Zhu Yunwen and called out in a childish voice, “Father Emperor, what is that?”
Zhu Yunwen lifted Zhu Wenkui and laughed, “That is something very special. Let’s go take a look together.”
Ma Enhui entered the hall, and at Zhu Yunwen’s gesture, Liang Xiu removed the red cloth, revealing three furnaces.
The furnaces were square-shaped, painted red on the outside, with a rectangular drawer at the bottom to collect coal ash. In the middle was a grate supported by iron bars, meant for holding the coal. On top, there was a heavy lead-iron cover with a small opening, and above that, another layer of iron plate cover.
The upper side of the furnace extended outwards, providing a space to place objects. Near the top rear wall of the furnace, there were smoke vents, a hot water tank compartment, and water inlets and outlets.
On the side, there were also small chimneys made of iron sheets, arranged in a row of pipes resembling a fence-like structure.
Ma Enhui looked carefully but couldn’t understand what she was looking at. She turned to Zhu Yunwen and asked, “What is this iron contraption?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled gently and said, “This is a good way for us to get rich. Let’s call it the ‘Warm Room Stove.'”
“Warm Room Stove?”
Ma Enhui lowered her head and looked at it, asking in confusion, “Although it’s different from ordinary stoves, how does it warm the room?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “It’s springtime now, and the weather isn’t very cold, so its effects might not be obvious. But since the Empress wants to give it a try, then you guys assemble it and add water.”
Liang Xiu and the others quickly assembled the chimney, then chose a spot on the wall, carved a small hole, and extended the chimney outside, bending it upward to prevent smoke from coming back in.
After connecting the heating panels, they filled it with water, and they took out the new type of Yeontan[1]Yeontan (Korean: 연탄) are coal briquettes used in East Asia for cooking and home heating. Made from a mixture of lignite coal dust and a gluing agent that … Continue reading coal, ignited it with charcoal on the outside, and clamped it into the furnace. On top, they placed an iron kettle.
After everything was set up, the people from palace armament bureau left, leaving only three pieces of Yeontan behind.
Zhu Yunwen ordered the room to be closed, then sat behind the table and said to Ma Enhui, who had only a partial understanding of the matter, “Ever since the incident at Chengqian Palace, I ordered the palace armament bureau to make this Warm Room Stove. However, they don’t even know how to mass-produce iron sheets, which has disappointed me greatly.”
“Mass-produce iron sheets? How do you mass-produce iron sheets? Isn’t it made by hammering it out one by one?” Ma Enhui asked with a puzzled expression.
Zhu Yunwen picked up a tea bowl and lightly tapped it against the tea saucer, saying, “Empress, many ideas come from daily life, and this method of mass-producing iron sheets is no exception.”
“How is it done?” Ma Enhui leaned in and inquired.
Zhu Yunwen took a sip of tea and said to Ma Enhui, “Empress, haven’t you seen rolling out dough before? You can compare the dough to a lump of iron. If you roll it out before it hardens completely, won’t you get iron sheets? It’s that simple.”
“Ah? This?” Ma Enhui was somewhat stunned.
Yes, what the emperor said was right.
If dough can be rolled out into dough sheets, why can’t iron be rolled out into iron sheets?
Why didn’t anyone think of such a simple idea before?
Although Ma Enhui didn’t understand metallurgy, she understood that forging iron typically involved melting iron, creating molds, and then crafting objects. However, if you poured molten iron into a hopper and combined it with a rolling iron mill, it would easily produce iron sheets.
Just a bit of edge refinement and assembly, and you’d have iron sheet chimneys.
“As for coal, I just can’t understand why they insist on using finely crushed coal. Why not completely pulverize it, mix it with clay, and create blocks? In the Imperial Palace, are there not enough bricks made from clay? Everyone knows how to fire clay into bricks, so why don’t they think of turning coal into brick-shaped blocks? Why go through the trouble of using coal chunks in these stoves and furnaces?”
Zhu Yuwen rubbed his forehead in frustration and asked.
Ma Enhui looked at him in astonishment, then glanced at the Yeontan coal placed not far away and sighed, “Compared to Your Majesty, I feel so ignorant.”
Zhu Yunwen gestured for Ma Enhui to sit down and continued, “It’s not that you’re ignorant, but rather that our people in Ming Dynasty lack innovation and the drive to seek new ideas.”
If Zhu Yunwen were just an ordinary citizen of the Ming Dynasty, a blacksmith, he would have spent his days hammering and crafting objects without questioning why coal was in chunks instead of cakes or considering that iron sheets could be rolled instead of beaten.
The limitations of their time and the repetitiveness of their lives made them not think about exploring new possibilities. They even believed that their inherited skills were the best.
It’s a pity that in thousands of years of history, despite countless inventions, very few scientists truly pursued innovation for its own sake.
Apart from the wisdom and collective knowledge of the masses, some inventions only happened by various accidents.
Take gunpowder, for instance; it was discovered by alchemists accidentally.
It wasn’t a lack of intelligence among the Chinese people but rather the lack of an environment conducive to innovation during the feudal era, along with a lack of a market for novel ideas.
For example, alcohol was clearly a distillation product, but people mistakenly thought it might be poisonous, and nobody dared to try it. If it weren’t for soldiers in the barracks frequently getting injured and wanting to test the effects of alcohol, the discovery of its usefulness might have been delayed.
Similarly, the palace armament bureau’ gunpowder division conducted several studies to improve firearms. Although they didn’t achieve significant breakthroughs, their advancements in range and power were still notable compared to the early Hongwu-era firearms.
But what rewards did they receive?
Oh, none.
As for their improvements, wasn’t that what they were supposed to do?
Without incentives, encouragement, or benefits, why would anyone bother with research?
It wasn’t Ma Enhui’s fault.
Being stuck in traditional ways was the norm for a feudal dynasty with a primarily agrarian economy. They were accustomed to staying within their own boundaries, occasionally gazing into the distance from a higher point.
But they never ventured beyond their boundaries.
Zhu Yunwen wanted to change all of this, to encourage people to imagine and innovate, but looking at the current state of education, it seemed incredibly difficult. There were only the Four Books and Five Classics; no mathematics or science.
Zhu Yunwen bitterly shook his head, gazing at the boiling kettle. Steam billowed, pushing the kettle’s lid open, and from the spout, there emitted a whistling sound, much like the urging of a steam whistle.



---


Chapter 97: Steam Engine? Lets call it a day.
“Steam engine?”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly. While he understood the principles of physics and knew that steam energy could be converted into mechanical energy, However, one cannot confuse the act of lifting the lid of a kettle with steam and the manufacturing of a steam engine.
They were two entirely different things.
One shouldn’t assume that knowing the principles of a steam engine meant you could simply point and tinker for a moment to build one.
Did they know that after Thomas Newcomen created the first practical industrial steam engine, it took sixty years of continuous optimization and improvement by generation after generation before it could only be used for mine drainage?
By the time James Watt came along, it took another twenty years of improvements before they had the “versatile prime mover,” which allowed humanity to enter the age of steam.
Considering the current technological foundation in Ming Dynasty, even if he presented blueprints, they wouldn’t be able to manufacture one.
Setting aside the fact that the cylinders, gears, and connecting rods required high-strength steel, where would they get the high-strength steel for the high-temperature, high-pressure boilers?
How would they manufacture the specialized components?
How would they address safety concerns?
He couldn’t just put on a helmet and pick up a hammer every day and become an engineer by himself.
Relying on oneself alone, starting from scratch to research and produce, one’s lifetime dream of seeing a steam engine and a train? Don’t kid yourself.
Ah, one must learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry to be fearless in traveling the world.
But now, look around the entire court, other than rough people who only know how to wield swords and stick, who are constantly eyeing other people’s throats, are those who are full of empty talk and uphold the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and filial piety, it’s difficult to find a few who can handle accounting, let alone engage in scientific research in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Let’s call it a day.
“Your Majesty, is it too early?” Ma Enhui glanced at the sky. It’s not even evening yet, and you want to sleep? Could it be that Your Majesty has been working too hard these past few days?
“Uh…”
Zhu Yunwen came back to reality and looked at Ma Enhui. Had he just said all that out loud?
“It’s warm.”
Zhu Yunwen changed the subject.
Ma Enhui stood up, gracefully twirling, her slender figure dancing with her long sleeves fluttering. She looked at Zhu YUnwen with bright eyes and said, “Your Majesty, this stove is indeed extraordinary. Not only does it eliminate the coal smoke, but it also provides warmth like late spring. It’s a remarkable treasure.”
“Haha, with this treasure, we won’t have to worry about poisoning in the winter. I plan to select a group of people from the palace to be in charge of Yeontan coal production, manufacturing the new stoves, and sales. Empress, do you have anyone in mind?”
Zhu Yunwen approached Ma Enhui, his gaze filled with affection.
Ma Enhui looked at the stove and the heating pipes beside it, saying, “Using palace maids might not be appropriate. In my opinion, the Vice Eunuch director of the Directorate of Imperial Accouterments, Zhao Gui, is loyal and capable in his daily duties. I think he should be entrusted with this task, and there should be no problems.”
“Zhao Gui, then? Very well, let it be him. Shuangxi, summon Zhao Gui.”
Zhu Yunwen agreed.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen and said softly, “Your Majesty, I had some biases about commerce a few days ago. Please forgive me.”
Zhu Yunwen pulled Ma Enhui, sitting her down on the couch, holding her hand and sighed, “Empress, you can still reconsider, but those courtiers haven’t grasped it yet. Implementing new commercial policies in Beiping and Suzhou has already caused quite a stir in the court. It shows that they are not in favor of these new commercial strategies becoming widespread.”
Ma Enhui smiled and said, “Your Majesty, they only see the increasing from a 1/30 to 1/15 tax. They are not interested in the other commercial policies, so naturally, they oppose it. I’ve heard that even though many officials don’t directly engage in business, there are quite a few merchants affiliated with them.”
“I see,” Zhu Yunwen said gently.
This was the typical integration of officials and merchants.
Although the “Great Ming Law” stipulated that officials above the fourth rank were forbidden from engaging in business, and they would be stripped and paraded if found guilty of embezzling sixty taels of silver, for Ming Dynasty officials, business was not an uncommon affair.
With such low commercial taxes and the power they held, why wouldn’t they try to make a bit of money?
Of course, these officials still want some dignity; they wouldn’t be like the two kings, appearing on the frontlines. Instead, they would manage their businesses through their relatives and servants.
For example, the notorious corrupt official Yan Song not only engaged in bribery but also made a fortune in the grain trade, becoming extremely wealthy.
Yan Song’s hometown was in Yuanzhou, Jiangxi, which consisted of one prefecture and four counties. Seventy percent of the land there belonged to the Yan family, and they didn’t have to pay taxes on it. When they had too much grain, what did they do? They exchanged it for silver.
Then there was Xu Jie, who managed to eliminate Yan Song. While he was known as a virtuous and wise statesman, he also engaged in business. He had around two hundred thousand acres of land in his hometown Huating, and he had established a large textile factory. They produced a significant amount of fabric each year, not only for domestic use but potentially for export as well. After all, Huating was not far from the sea, and they had small sailing vessels.
During Zhu Yunwen’s reign, Ming Dynasty officials weren’t this audacious. The ministers and high-ranking officials were relatively clean, but when it came to officials below the fourth rank, including local officials, it was a different story.
However, Zhu Yunwen wasn’t in a hurry. Even though he allowed the two kings to engage in business, opening up this opportunity, these officials seemed to overlook one thing: all of the two king’s land was confiscated, leaving them with only the income from their king title and what they earned from business.
In the future, this could serve as a template. Officials who wanted to engage in business were allowed, but they had to pay a price. For kings, it meant confiscating their land. For officials, it meant resigning from their official positions. If they wanted to be officials and businessmen at the same time, they were deluding themselves.
The dangers of the exchange of power and money were something Zhu Yunwen deeply understood. The thought of a lowly clerk receiving bribes worth hundreds of millions made it impossible to talk about fairness and justice in the market.
Commerce needed regulations, but at the moment, Ming Dynasty commerce was like a stumbling foal, far from the point where it needed a bridle.
Zhao Gui, the vice eunuch director of the directorate of imperial accoutrements arrives.
After explaining the specific tasks, Zhu Yunwen asked, “Are you willing to leave the palace to handle this?”
“I am willing!” Zhao Gui quickly agreed. How could he refuse such a good opportunity that had fallen into his lap?
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said seriously, “Listen carefully. When you leave the palace to handle this, you must forget your identity in the inner palace. Whether you are buying coal, selling yeontan coal, or dealing with stoves, you cannot use the identity of the inner palace! Whatever price you should buy at, you must buy at that price, and you cannot exert pressure or use force to take things forcefully!”
“If someone comes to buy or sell, you must treat them well. Even if they scold you and vandalize your shop, you cannot claim to be from the inner palace! Do not think that Empress and I will support you! After leaving the palace, you are a merchant, and you must conduct yourself accordingly. Do you understand?”
Zhao Gui was a bit surprised and didn’t understand why Zhu Yunwen was doing this. If he used his position in the inner palace to directly acquire coal, no one dare to have any objections. After he had it produced, he could just sit back and enjoy the profits.
Why go through the trouble of buying, manufacturing, and selling like a common merchant? And not defending himself when people attack? Was this appropriate?
“I understand,” Zhao Gui said, even though he was puzzled, he remembered it.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Choose three to five capable individuals from the directorate of imperial accouterments to go with you. You will learn the ways of business under the two kings for a month, and then I will personally assess your progress. If you do well, the business outside the palace will be entrusted to you.”
Zhao Gui’s eyes brightened, and he knelt and said, “I will do my best and won’t let Your Majesty and the Empress down.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, letting Zhao Gui leave. He walked to the desk and unfolded a map of the Ming Dynasty, his gaze filled with worry.
Ma Enhui approached and, seeing Zhu Yunwen staring northward on the map, asked with concern, “Your Majesty, is there anything happening in the northern region?”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and sighed, “There is a major issue with the new army policies in Beiping. I don’t know if Zhang Bing and Ping’an can find a solution.”

Chapter 98: Requesting Permission from the Emperor
As the nightfall descended and the lanterns of Beiping Prefecture were lit, the city remained bustling and lively. The sounds of musical instruments and drinking games from the taverns echoed in the distance.
Merchants were celebrating with great enthusiasm.
The new commercial policies had granted a fundamental dignity to all merchants, relieving them from the need to register under any specific household.
A merchant was now just a merchant, with no distinction between merchant status and civilian or military status.
The old prohibition against merchants wearing silk had also been abolished. As long as they didn’t violate court etiquette and common customs, they could wrap themselves in eighteen layer of silk, and no one would intervene.
While the merchants celebrated with drunken revelry, inside the Regional Military Command’s office, an air of solemnity prevailed.
Ping An paced back and forth, Zhang Jing sat with a furrowed brow, and Sheng Yong sighed.
“Commander, please stop walking back and forth,” Zhang Jing said, massaging his temples as Ping An’s pacing was giving him a headache.
Ping An halted his steps, looked at Zhang Jing, and said, “You’ve seen the court documents. You’re known for your wisdom. Can you come up with some ideas? If we continue like this, can we still proceed with the new army policies?”
Zhang Jing picked up a tea bowl, opened the lid, found it empty, and placed it heavily on the table, saying, “We absolutely cannot halt the implementation of the new army policies.”
“Implementation, implementation, but how can we implement them? The new military policies emphasize training and strengthening the army, but now? We’re drawing soldiers from various regional garrisons, and their minds are preoccupied with the land they’ve been allotted. Who has the time and focus for training?” Sheng Yong impatiently tapped on the table.
Zhang Bing rose from his seat, his tone stern, and said, “That’s the problem. The court hasn’t given us a clear method, so we need to think about how to maintain soldier training while not hindering land reclamation.”
Sheng Yong coldly huffed, “I might not know much, but I’ve heard that you can’t have both fish and bear’s paw. Now Commissioner Zhang wants both. Is there anything so perfect in this world?”
Zhang Jing stood up and said sternly, “Then what do you suggest we do? The Emperor has allowed us to come up with our own solutions. Can we go back and ask the Emperor again?”
Sheng Yong found himself at a loss for words.
The Emperor allowed the new commercial strategy to be implemented in Beiping but did not address the issue of the new army policies for Beiping Garrison, only giving a straightforward and clear instruction: “Find your own solutions.”
It was evident that the Emperor’s stance was clear: training could not be relaxed. As for the issue of land reclamation and production, they needed to come up with their own solution.
Although Ping An is the Commander of Beiping, he can handle battles, engage in combat, and strategize without any issue. However, when it comes to military land cultivation issues, he feels at a loss.
While the garrison was a military matter, it was not fundamentally different from civilian administration.
Ping An was unable to handle it effectively, and Sheng Yong was in a similar predicament.
That’s why, even though it was a matter for the Regional Military Commander, Ping An had invited Zhang Bing over.
Zhang Bing was in charge of civil administration in Beiping, and he was a relatively assertive figure. His approach had been swift and effective in Beiping and its surrounding regions, and even Ping An and others had been surprised by the speed.
At the rate Zhang Bing is progressing, it’s almost certain that in the future, Beiping  Prefecture will be recognized among the top ten prefectures.
Ping An hoped that Zhang Bing could contribute his wisdom to help resolve the biggest challenge of the new army policies.
“Sheng Yong, be cautious with your words,” Ping An warned with a furrowed brow.
Sheng Yong sighed and leaned back in his chair, remaining silent.
Ping An personally poured a cup of tea for Zhang Bing and said, “As you know, the soldiers currently in Beiping City, apart from the basic guards, Prefectural soldiers, and the Three Guards of King of Yan, are all transferred from various regional garrisons like Huaicai Garrison, Yanqing Garrison, Baiyangkou Garrison, Bohai Garrison, etc. Their number has reached up to eighty thousand. It’s near march now, and someone needs to look after the growing wheat.”
“If we allow them to return to their garrisons for farming, the New Army policy will become mere formality, and the path to building a strong army will be abandoned. We won’t be able to justify this to the court. If we can’t find a solution, I fear there will be no way forward for me and Sheng Yong.”
Zhang Bing looked at the worried expression on Ping An’s face and understood the difficulty he was facing. Even though Beiping Prefecture was now fully under the control of the court, the Three Guards were still influenced by the King of Yan.
With the King of Yan absent from Beiping, Zhu Gaochi is the supreme commander of the three guards of King Yan
At least, until the court officially disbanded the Three Guards, it appeared that way.
So, Ping An had been maintaining a substantial number of soldiers Beiping Prefecture. One was for selecting and training soldiers, and the other was for contingencies.
However, now, soldiers from various regional garrisons were eager to return to their fields. Should they be allowed to go back or not?
If they were allowed, they would return once the wheat was harvested, and then return to training?
The soldiers said, “Commander, i still need to plant cotton.”
Give them time to plant cotton, and after they’ve done that, they’d return after a month, saying, “I need to go back and tend to the fields.”
They would ride back, tend to the fields, and return to Beiping for training. In less than two months, they’d be back to harvest the cotton.
After harvesting cotton, it’d be time to plant wheat again.
Once the wheat was planted, they’d pat the dirt off their clothes and report back to Beiping, “I am done, let’s resume training.”
A gust of wind would blow in, and winter would come.
All year round, they’d spend eight months farming, one month on the road, and three months in training. Could they create elite soldiers like this?
But if they weren’t allowed to return, the Garrison System and the land cultivation system would still be in place. Fifty mu of land and eighteen dan of grain. When military officers came to collect the grain, they wouldn’t care whether training had taken place; they’d only care about the grain.
If the grain contribution fell short, what would happen? You have to make up for it.
No money? Impossible, military men received military pay, and it could be deducted. Soldiers had asked, “If we’re not allowed to go back for farming, and the officers deduct our military pay when they collect grain, can we come to you to claim it?”
Ping An and Sheng Yong were troubled. Eighty thousand soldiers meant a total of one million four hundred forty thousand dan of grain, equivalent to seven hundred twenty thousand taels of silver. Even if the two of them sold their residences and belongings, they wouldn’t be able to fill such a gaping hole.
“Let’s make the problem clear,” Zhang Bing said with a serious expression. He looked at Ping An and Sheng Yong and continued, “The New Army Policy is aimed at building a strong army, so allowing the soldiers to go back to farming and tilling the land is definitely not an option, is that correct?”
Ping An nodded vigorously and said solemnly, “We must not allow them to farm. They are the soldiers of the Great Ming! A soldier can only wield spears and swords!”
Zhang Bing sat down, picked up his teacup, and with a determined look in his eyes, he said, “Alright, let’s stop discussing whether the soldiers should return to farming. From this moment on, all discussions must be based on the premise that the soldiers will not return. I believe we can find a solution!”
Sheng Yong wanted to speak but was silenced by a stern look from Ping An.
With great respect, Ping An inquired, “Official Zhang, the biggest issue if the soldiers don’t return is that their farmland will be left untended. Once the fields become barren and unproductive, how do we deal with the collection of grain by the garrisons?”
Indeed.
No one can expect crops to grow without tending to the fields, right?
The garrison system requires soldiers to work the fields, while the New Army policy demands soldiers for training. A soldier can’t do both things at the same time.
That’s right!
One soldier can’t do both tasks simultaneously, but if we bring in an additional person…
Mr. Zhang sipped his tea, his throat seemingly dry and unrelieved. He placed the empty teacup on the table and fell silent for a moment. Then, he looked at Ping An and said seriously, “We need to request permission from the Emperor!”
“Permission? What kind of permission?” Ping An and Sheng Yong stood up simultaneously, asking with hopeful expressions.

Chapter 99: Zhu Gaoxu also has rebellious genes
The waning moon sinks in the west, casting its reflection on the water on both sides of the north and south. This rare and enchanting scene of ‘one day, three moons’ is so mesmerizing.
Zhu Gaoxu gazes the moon at lugou bridge[1]Marco Polo Brige without turning his eyes away until the day gradually breaks, and the waning moon disappears. He nods in satisfaction and says to Jin Zhong behind him, “Do you remember the poem left by Jin Dynasty Minister of rite and Academician of the Hanlin Academy Zhao Bingwen here?’
Jin Zhong respectfully bows and says, “Your Highness, I remember.”
“Recite it for me.”
Zhu Gaoxu turns around and says.
Jin Zhong recites, “River-dividing bridge pillars stretch like melon vines,
Passersby at the capital’s gate resemble canine teeth.
As the sun sets on the willows of Lugou Bridge,
I’ve seen off friends departing for the capital countless times.”
Zhu Gaoxu’s eyes reveal a hint of sharpness as he says, “As the sun sets on the willows of Lugou Bridge, I’ve seen off friends departing for the capital countless times. This Lugou Bridge, we cannot just bid farewell to those leaving. Sir, you ask, will those who have departed ever return?!”
Jin Zhong looks at Zhu Gaoxu, and his heart trembles. The Prince’s words carry a hidden meaning!
“If one is willing, they will naturally come back.”
Jin Zhong replies cautiously.
Zhu Gaoxu slaps the stone lion on the railing and fixes his gaze on Jin Zhong. He sternly asks, “Master, can you read fortunes? Are they accurate?”
Jin Zhong raises his eyebrows and quickly says, “Your Highness, fortune-telling is based on one’s fate at the time. With the shifting of stars and the changing of fate, one’s fortune may change.”
“Then take another look at this Prince’s future, whether there’s a way to rise to the top!”
Zhu Gaoxu says sternly.
Jin Zhong understands that when Zhu Gaoxu talks about being able to rise to the top, he is referring to the character “仐” that Zhu Gaoxu wrote when they first met.
According to the fortune-telling at that time, Zhu Gaoxu’s future should have been as a vassal king. If he can rise higher, it would mean becoming an emperor!
Jin Zhong trembles slightly. Zhu Di had surrendered to Zhu, Zhu Gaoxu still has aspirations to become an emperor?
What kind of family is this!
Zhu Yuanzhang, with a background of rebellion, toppled the Yuan Dynasty.
Zhu Di also wanted to rebel, to get rid of his own nephew, but halfway through his rebellion, he was suppressed by a series of moves by Zhu Yunwen, unable to catch his breath, pretending to be crazy and stupid, and couldn’t escape. He had to go to the capital to plead guilty.
He thought that the world was peaceful and that he could continue to set up stalls on the streets and alleys to tell fortunes and deceive people. However, after Zhu Di left Beiping, Zhu Gaoxu treated him with great respect and generosity, which made him feel valued.
It turns out that Zhu Gaoxu had plans all along.
Jin Zhong felt a sense of killing intent behind him. Without a doubt, if he didn’t serve Zhu Gaoxu well today, this Lu Gou Bridge would become his burial ground!
“Your Highness is destined for wealth and nobility, and possesses the Jade Steps patterns in hand, bearing the aura of an emperor. However, this path is long and difficult to achieve.”
Jin Zhong looks at Zhu Gaoxu’s palm, ponders for a long time, and cautiously says.
Zhu Gaoxu’s complexion improves significantly. He withdraws his hand and says to Jin Zhong, “Then, in the future, you will work for this Prince. You will be the foremost subject when the time comes!”
Jin Zhong quickly bows and says, “Thank you, Your Highness.”
Zhu Gaoxu, in a very good mood, looks at the brightening sky and says in a deep voice, “Now, the ‘Single Whip method’ and the national policy to curb land consolidation have greatly harmed the interests of the gentry. If we can win them over, and use their wealth to support my elite troops. It may not be impossible to achieve great success. Father didn’t dare to do it, so I’ll take it on!”
Under the coercion of Zhu Gaoxu, Jin Zhong had no choice but to do things for him.
In Beiping Prefecture, the gentry who have been severely affected by the ‘Single Whip method’ and the anti-land consolidation policy see that Zhu Gaoxu wants to stand up for the gentry. They are flocking to Zhu Gaoxu’s side. Those with money are contributing money, and those with connections are offering their connections.
In summary, these gentry hope that Zhu Gaoxu can convey a message to the court, that the policy of curbing consolidation is not feasible, and the abolition of the gentry’s fiefs and tax-exempt lands is also not viable.
They hope that Zhu Yunwen will turn back and restore the ancestral system to protect the interests of the gentry.
They do not know Zhu Gaoxu’s true intentions, and if they did, they probably would not have joined in.
After all, Zhu Gaoxu is the son of Zhu Di, and he has learned some acting skills, coupled with his study of Machiavellian tactics. He has indeed won over a group of gentry, all of this happening in secret, not even Zhu Gaochi noticed.
Capital, Central Army Commandery.
Zhu Di had just returned from observing military exercises at the training ground when he said to Xu Huizu, “We must strengthen the training of the cavalry in the capital. The current level of our cavalry is still unable to directly confront the elite cavalry of the Tatars and the Oirats!”
Xu Huizu frowned, then relaxed and said, “Your Highness, the Tatar and Oirats cavalry have grown up on horseback from a young age, while our cavalry mostly undergo training as adults. It’s not easy to catch up with the elite cavalry of the Tatars and Oirats.”
Zhu Di shook his head and said firmly, “The Mongol cavalry is powerful due to well-structured training, strict discipline, expert horseback archery, and effective tactics. Although our Great Ming has often defeated the Tatars in the past, looking at the current tactics of the capital’s cavalry, I’m afraid they will suffer a devastating defeat in actual combat.”
“Is it that serious?”
Xu Huizu, who was well-versed in military strategy, had heard of the strength of the Tatar cavalry, but they had ultimately been defeated. Moreover, after half a year of special training for the capital’s cavalry, their combat strength had improved significantly. Wasn’t this enough to satisfy Zhu Di?
Zhu Di sat down and said, “I want to ask the Emperor to transfer some of the Duoyan Three Guards to the capital.”
“Duoyan Three Guards?”
Xu Huizu was suddenly surprised.
Zhu Di nodded solemnly and said, “The Duoyan Three Guards are mainly Mongols and are experts in cavalry tactics. Since you believe that the capital’s cavalry has already achieved something, it might be a good idea to let them have a real competition and let the capital’s cavalry see what real elite cavalry is like! If we don’t wake them up completely, the cavalry of the Great Ming will only reach this level. Duke of Wei, what do you think?”
Xu Huizu understood Zhu Di’s intentions: use cavalry to train cavalry.
“The Doyan Three Guards are the elite troops under King of Ning’s command. If they were to be transferred to the capital, how many soldiers would be optimal?”
Xu Huizu agreed with Zhu Di’s suggestion.
Zhu Di thought for a moment and said, “At least one thousand cavalry.”
After considering it, Xu Huizu finally nodded and said, “Then please write a memorial, and I will endorse it.”
Zhu Di smiled and said, “Very well.”
If one cannot match others in skill, then one must learn and surpass them, then surpass them again, that is the right path.
“Your Highness, it is difficult to train cavalry, and it is even more difficult to produce elite troops. If we look at our generation and the previous generation of cavalry, we are already weaker by twenty percent. If we wait another ten or twenty years, will we become weaker by thirty to fourty percent? What should we do when that time comes? In the end, our Great Ming will still rely on infantry.”
Xu Huizu expressed his concerns.
Zhu Di also saw this problem. Over the years, cavalry had been gradually weakening, and this was an undeniable fact.
Just like the Yuan Dynasty, the cavalry swept the world during its founding, how majestic it was!
They destroyed the Western Liao, defeated the Western Xia, expelled the Khwarazmians, step on Jin, and swallowed the Song!
But in less than ninety years, the Mongol cavalry had become so weak that they couldn’t even ride horses properly.
The decline of cavalry was not unique to the Yuan Dynasty; the Great Ming must also consider this issue.
“It seems that we need to retrain our formations.”
Zhu Di walked to the sand table on the side.
On the sand table, there were models of cavalry, infantry, and arquebusiers, and a bold idea was gradually taking shape…

Chapter 100: Zheng He’s Military Order: Land on the Island, Kill the Pirates!
The East Sea, with strong winds and rough waves.
Dozens of ships of various sizes ride the waves, and the cries of the sailors on board continue to sound.
Zheng He stands steadily at the bow of the ship and shouts loudly, “Signal Zhu Neng and Zhang Yu, we must not let these pirates escape!”
A flag bearer by his side walks to the side of the ship. After three strikes of the bronze gong, the flag bearer waves two yellow flags, crosses them, lowers them down, and repeats the motion until the sound of the gong from a nearby ship responds, then stops.
Zhu Neng stands on a 300 liao battleship, which, although not as large as Zheng He’s 400 liao battleship, is still a formidable warship. Just three hundred paces away are five Japanese pirate ships.
Not long ago, this group of pirates had gathered more than two hundred people and invaded Andong, but they were driven into the sea by the troops of Andong before they could decide whether to hold a funeral or change their location for robbery, Zheng He’s naval fleet arrived.
After leaving behind two ships and more than thirty corpses, these pirates took advantage of their small and agile boats to escape. Along the way, they attempted several times to break out individually but were forced by Zheng He, Zhang Yu, and Zhu Neng’s naval forces to continue heading east.
Zheng He was not in a hurry. Killing one group after another of these pirates seemed to only make them increase in numbers and become even more aggressive. There were even organized attacks, which made Zheng He curious about who was controlling these pirates behind the scenes.
“We’ve spotted an island ahead!”
The naval troops shouted.
Zheng He quickly looked and said, “Let them rest in the sea! Charge!”
On the left side, Zhang Yu led three warships, and on the right, Zhu Neng led three warships, with Zheng He in the center, they accelerated towards the enemy!
The pirates saw this and began to shout wildly, waving their Japanese swords and some even pulled out arquebuses and fired at Zheng He’s ships.
The shield-bearers by Zheng He’s side didn’t even move. The range of the arquebuses was insufficient to break through 150 steps. The fact that they were haphazardly using their arquebuses at such a range only indicated their extreme panic.
Zheng He raised his hand, and the trebuchet was ready, filled with jars containing lime, mud, and iron caltrops. Eighty soldiers leaned against the side of the ship, arrows drawn.
“Fire!”
When the distance closed to about a hundred and fifty paces, Zheng He suddenly waved his hand.
With a hum, the trebuchet launched jars from various ships. Some fell into the sea, and others landed on the pirate ships. Lime dispersed, smoke billowed, and the iron caltrops tore through the faces and hands of the pirates, resulting in cries of agony.
“Fire!”
Zheng He shouted loudly.
The soldiers drew their bows to full draw, aiming at the sky. The arrows were released and then fell, covering a small area of the sea.
After firing the arrows, the soldiers stood up calmly. Twenty soldiers held long spears, hooked spears, shields, and swords, while another twenty held arquebuses. There were also twenty soldiers holding fire arrows and Shenji arrows.
As the distance closed in, the arquebusiers fired one after another. Then came the fire arrows and Shenji arrows. The pirates on the ships had already been reduced to a state of chaos. Many of them had been killed, and even before the boarding battle began, the Ship plowed directly through.
Several pirate ships were shattered upon impact, becoming a mass of broken wooden planks.
This move was called ‘Chongjiao’ [1]literally ‘ramming with the prow’.
After eliminating the pirate ships, small boats were lowered from the ship. Soldiers armed with hook-sickles, shields, swords, and arquebuses, moved along the periphery of the ship, constantly searching for the pirates.
When they encountered the living, a shot from an arquebus followed by a beheading was the procedure. When they encountered the dead, the same procedure was followed.
This was the brutal experience of bloodshed.
At the beginning of the naval battle, the pirates would pretend to be dead, and when the Ming troops approached, they would counterattack and attempt to seize the ships.
To minimize casualties among his soldiers, Zheng He gave the order:
Regardless of whether they are alive or dead, treat them all as if they are alive, then deal with their heads later.
“Deputy General, ahead should be Cheniushan Island, Should we land there?” asked Li Xing, Zheng He’s assistant.
Zheng He looked coldly at the distant island. It was highly likely to be a pirate hideout, but they had no information about the number of pirates present.
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng boarded Zheng He’s flagship.
Zhang Yu asked solemnly, “Deputy General, the enemy’s strength is unknown, and our forces consist of only 800 troops. Should we wait for reinforcements before landing and exploring the island?”
Zheng He also understood that his naval forces were scattered in various locations, and although these few ships were the main force, they were still understaffed. Landing and fighting on an island was not their strong suit, especially with the unknown situation of the pirates. Rushing in recklessly would result in losses.
“What does General Zhu think?” Zheng He asked solemnly.
After a moment of contemplation, Zhu Neng said, “The pirates have plundered our people, killed our citizens, and committed numerous crimes! No matter how many pirates there are, we should go and kill them! With our soldiers and firearms, even if they number two thousand, it is not enough to fear!”
“Isn’t that too reckless?” Zhang Yu, who was more cautious, asked.
Zhu Neng nodded solemnly and said, “Taking risks is inevitable, but consider this: if our wives, children, and loved ones are on that island, in the hands of the pirates, who would be willing to endure it? Who would be willing to wait? Every moment we delay landing, there’s a good chance we might lose another life!.”
Zheng He looked at the island, raised his hand, and struck the ship’s railing heavily. He said in a resolute tone, “Land and kill the pirates!”
On the first day of the third month, it was also the first day of the lunar month.
Under strong pressure from the Ministry of Rites and the officials, Zhu Yunwen conducted a sacrificial ceremony to honor Confucius.
Wearing a ceremonial leather cap and gown, Zhu Yunwen proceeded to the Fengtian hall. He issued decrees, appointed officials, and offered sacrificial offerings. After arranging the sacrificial ceremony and livestock offerings, he organized ceremonial music and dance performances. The ritual began with the chanting of “Welcoming the Deity,” followed by the performance of the ‘Xian He’ music:
“Great is the Sage,
Venerated for his virtue.
Upholding the royal legacy,
The people follow his teachings.
With rituals properly performed,
Our purity and reverence increase.
May the spirits come and accept our offerings,
And illuminate our devotion.”
Following the ‘Xian He’ music, the ceremony proceeded with offerings of silk and a performance of ‘Dian Bo, Conducting the Initial Ritual.’ The ceremonial music continued with ‘Ning He’ music:
“Since the birth of our people,
Who has surpassed his grandeur?
Only the royal sage and deity,
Exceed the ancients.
Our grain and silk are ready,
And the rites are meticulously observed.
Oblations of millet and rice,
May the spirits grant their presence…”
Subsequently, there were ‘An He,’ ‘Jing He,’ and ‘Xian He’ music performances, all under the title of ‘Xian He’ (though with different contents).
The degree of respect for Confucius during the Ming Dynasty can be seen through the elaborate and complex rituals, which, in a way, demonstrate the powerful influence of Confucius and his teachings.
The practice of emperors paying homage to Confucius dates back to Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang, but the first emperor to perform a kowtow ritual specifically to Confucius was Emperor Taizu of later Zhou, Guo Wei. The second emperor to do so was Zhu Yuanzhang.
Now, it was Zhu Yunwen’s turn to follow suit.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t have particularly strong personal feelings toward Confucius. If it weren’t for his knowledge from his “previous life,” Zhu Yunwen wouldn’t even be able to recite passages from the “Analects.” Talking about respect for Confucius, he couldn’t simply rely on the line “Is it not a pleasure, having friends come from afar?”
However, nobody could deny the contributions of Confucius to Chinese culture and philosophy.
Just as that line written on the wall of the Shudao Pavilion goes:
“Without Confucius, it would be eternal darkness through the ages.”
Heavenly teacher or not, if kowtowing is what it takes, so be it.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t mind paying his respects to Confucius. Considering Confucius’s contributions to Chinese culture, he would gladly bow a three thousand times if needed.
What troubled Zhu Yunwen was that the Ministry of Rites seemed to be using this method to resist the reforms at the Imperial Academy. It was a subtle reminder that Confucius was the ultimate teacher, and trying to change the status of Confucianism was an impossible task.
If the Imperial Academy didn’t reform, achieving well-rounded talent would be nothing but a pipe dream. After all, the Imperial Academy was the highest institution of learning in the Ming Dynasty, right under his nose. Could he even hope to reform local county schools when he couldn’t change this?
Those stubborn traditionalists were like stubborn logs. Wasn’t it just about adding some extracurricular readings and practical experience beyond the Four Books and Five Classics? Why the extreme caution and resistance?
Culture thrives through diversity and open debate!
Did they not know that Confucius said, “Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous”? Did they forget that Mencius advocated, “Believe wholeheartedly in books, but it’s better to have no books”? How did they end up here, emphasizing theory while neglecting practice?
Don’t like it, resisting?
I have plenty of ways to deal with you!
