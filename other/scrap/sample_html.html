     </div><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">   Chapter 1034: Role Model Franz 
      </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Facts have proved that there are always more solutions than difficulties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the problem may not necessarily be solved, once the human brain starts functioning, solutions will always emerge. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        To solve the problem of people running away with money, the core problem lies in the quality of personnel and the supervision of funds. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The quality of personnel will definitely not be solved in a short period of time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has been less than a year since the establishment of the investment group. The employees were all newly recruited and there was no loyalty at all. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Because of the special nature of the profession, investment groups have very high requirements for "fooling" ability when recruiting employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not to mention that everyone who does this is a liar. Anyway, liars come to apply and are almost 100% accepted. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Originally, the employees were a mixed bag, but for the sake of corporate efficiency, Rivera formulated strict performance appraisal measures. Those who are capable are promoted and those who are mediocre are demoted. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There seems to be no problem, but the particularity of the profession is ignored. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deceiving investors into taking their money out of their pockets is clearly a position tailor-made for scammers. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        No matter how eloquent ordinary people are, they still have a process of adaptation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When it comes to deceiving investors, it is obviously not as good as more professional liars. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        So it’s not surprising that money ran away. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, scammers climb faster and can easily sneak into company management and be entrusted with important tasks to raise funds. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Rivera's picture can only tie up ambitious liars. However, not every liar has great ideals. Many people just want to get a vote and leave. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Fortunately, Rivera has a strong ability to deceive people. This is not called "charisma". 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Relying on his extraordinary charisma, Rivera also won over a group of people who worked for him wholeheartedly, otherwise the situation would have been even worse. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Unless the recruitment model is changed, the mixed situation of investment groups will never be solved. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        However, once the recruitment model is changed, the team's business capabilities will be greatly reduced. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although Rivera hates being cheated, big plans have been set in motion and he now desperately needs money. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It seems that the investment group is starting to make a profit, but the floating profit on the book is not a profit at all. It only has an increase of 20 to 30%. Once a large amount of shipments are made, it will immediately fall back. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Rivera is not a short-term player. What he wants to build is a consortium rooted in the middle class and change the world where wealth is monopolized by a few people. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If we can’t work on people, we can only think of ways to regulate funds. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The investment group alone cannot do it. Even if it sends more supervisors, it will only add a few cents. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There is no betrayal, it is just because the interests are not big enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just look at the money scammers, which basically happen after large-scale seminars. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Because investors actively participated and the amount of funds received on site was too large, some people would run away with their money. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        In addition to strengthening supervision at home, the cooperation of banks is still indispensable if we really want to solve the problem. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If an account could be fixed, allowing investors to deposit money directly into the fixed account, and only Rivera himself could withdraw it, then the possibility of his subordinates taking the money and running away would be greatly reduced. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It is a very common service in later generations, and any bank is very happy to undertake the business, but banks in this era simply do not provide it. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It’s not that banks don’t know how to make progress. The key is that without the Internet, it is difficult to transmit information in a timely manner. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this context, opening value-added services is causing trouble for yourself. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Think about all information transmission, all of which can only be done manually. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any mistake along the way will cause huge losses to the bank. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        In fact, many people these days also complain about the complicated procedures of banks and the slow speed of remittances. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        But there is no other way. It is purely manual operation. For safety reasons, banks can only do this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if they knew it would reduce efficiency, no bank would risk making changes. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If international business exchange is involved, this time will be even longer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would take more than a month at the fastest to transfer a sum of money from Britain into the Holy Roman Empire. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If something unexpected happens midway, it is not impossible for the payment to be delayed for three to five months. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The procedure is troublesome and takes a long time. The key is that banks also charge high handling fees, and most banks do not accept small-amount remittances. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although the total business volume of Rivera's investment group is very large, it does not mean that the amount of each investment will be large. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Investors are not fools. Under uncertain circumstances, many people will make a small trial investment first, and only make additional investments after they are sure it is safe. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If the existing business model is followed, the funds will not only have to stay in the bank for a month or two, but will also be charged high fees, and the investment group will suffer huge losses. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although Rivera also secretly controlled Appel Commercial Bank, it was only a small bank operating in Germany. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The outlets do not even cover the Holy Roman Empire, let alone overseas markets. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Not to mention small banks like this, even the largest commercial banks in the world have limited branch coverage these days. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Generally speaking, a bank that can cover major cities in the country and set up several branches in international metropolises such as London and Vienna is a proper international bank. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        This is embarrassing. Now it is not a question of whether banks can do it, but that others simply cannot do it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So far, no bank in the world has the capacity to meet Rivera's needs. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Especially when it comes to cross-border business, bank cooperation alone is not enough. Rivera also has to deal with insurance companies and law firms. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Without the help of these local snakes to supervise, it is unknown whether the money can come out after entering the bank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Losing the money in your account is not something that is exclusive to any particular industry. In this age of manual labor, accidents are more likely to happen. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It's just that times are different, and the methods of response are also different. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The impact is naturally different. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Rivera, who has a background in finance, is very familiar with these operations, and he does not have that much time to defend his rights. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Perhaps it was because people were having so much fun these days that later European countries introduced extremely strict disciplinary laws, which changed the situation. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        For a time, Rivera was like a hard-working little bee, flying around the European continent, constantly looking for banks, insurance companies, and law firms to discuss cooperation. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Affected by Rivera, European airlines' performance increased significantly. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        After all, not many people dare to fly in flying vehicles these days. Rivera, a well-known figure who flies every day, is a good publicity case. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        As for the vast American and Asian markets, limited by transportation, Rivera can only reluctantly give up temporarily. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        A CEO who can deceive, coupled with a seemingly good story, and a beautiful profit statement, is simply invincible. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Under the promotion of the operation team, Rivera and his investment group suddenly became influential figures in the European world. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It’s unknown whether he bought the space, but Rivera’s photos appeared in all major economic newspapers. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Bonus comment: "The greatest entrepreneur, investment expert, and financial expert in the 19th century..." 
      </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Rivera's investment group is also known as the most potential enterprise in Europe and is highly sought after by the capital world. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        His popularity has almost reached the point where he is a household name. Even Franz, who has lived in the palace compound for a long time, has heard his name more than once. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If he hadn't sent someone to confirm again and again, Franz once thought that Rivera was another time traveler who entered by mistake. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        All kidding aside, just looking at Rivera's investment goals, they all buy whatever has potential, and almost all of them are high-quality assets at the bottom. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There is no way, who makes the two people's bargain hunting goals surprisingly similar? 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The only difference is that Franz started earlier and bought a larger share; while Rivera started later and had less abundant funds. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Surprised, after confirming that he was not a time traveler, Franz stopped paying attention. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The emperor was also very busy. In addition to his daily work, he was also busy eating melons and watching the fun. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no time to pay attention to a "capitalist", even an investment genius. 
        </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It's not that similar geniuses have never appeared before, but the fate of these people was not very good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Either he died of his dream, or his virtue was not up to par and he was killed. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        "Break the oligarchic model of consortia and build a new economic era." 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Just listen. Until the 21st century, the oligarchic model of consortia has not been truly broken, let alone now. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Even if I click through the entire consortium, it will be useless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"If the old doesn't go, the new won't come." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story of a boy who slays a dragon and turns into an evil dragon has always been played out in this world. 
        </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although he failed to achieve his goals, Rivera still played an active role in promoting social development. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Needless to say, it is only incidental to stimulate the development of the aviation industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, he also bought airline stocks at the bottom, so he should help with advertising. 
        </font></font><br>
        <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The most important thing is to promote the development of the financial industry. With the continuous good news, more and more banks and insurance companies have been roped in by Rivera. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Services that were originally supposed to appear only in the 20th century entered the stage of history in the 19th century, which greatly facilitated enterprises. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If it were not limited by technology, it is estimated that the cross-border financial cooperation promoted by Rivera might really be able to achieve the ultimate goal of the banking industry - "connecting the world." 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The public's attention was attracted by stories of wealth, but politicians were always paying attention to the three wars in the Far East, the Cuban independence movement, and the Philippine rebellion. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Needless to say about the Sino-Japanese War, anyway, now is the time when the Japanese are full of luck and have officially opened their protagonist halo. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Both the Cuban independence movement and the Philippine rebellion revolved around one protagonist - the Kingdom of Spain. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Let's put it this way, if either battlefield fails, Spain will really be removed from the list of great powers. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        This time is different from last time. Before, it was only the media of Britain, Russia and Austria. They were dissatisfied with being tied with Spain to become the four major European powers. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        After all, the title of "Four Great Powers" also has historical origin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the past hundred years, it has been monopolized by the four countries of Britain, France, Russia and Austria, and it is full of gold content and quality. 
        </font></font><br>
        <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Mixing into Spain is like mixing a husky into a pack of wolves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although they look somewhat similar, the problem is that a husky is a husky and will never become a real "wolf". 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It seems that Spain's fall from the position of the great powers has little to do with everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this is not the case. This means that there is one less person at the table who is qualified to share the cake. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There are many countries with ambitions to become great powers, but none have the strength to rise to the top. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no one to fill the seat, which means that after France, there is one less great power. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The number of great powers continues to decrease. It seems that everyone has less pressure and does not need to face so many bosses, which is conducive to the reduction of international disputes. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        In fact, that's not the case at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reduction of great powers can only mean that resources are more concentrated. By absorbing these resources, the top powers will become more powerful. 
        </font></font><br>
        <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The law of "the strong always gets stronger" is vividly reflected here. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        As the number of great powers decreases, international competition will also become more intense. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the critical moment of competition, all countries will be forced to take sides. 
        </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Perhaps in a short period of time, the three powers of Britain, Russia and Austria will stand side by side, and it seems to be very stable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem is that the existence of the Russian-Austrian alliance directly breaks this balance. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although Spain does not fall and cannot change this pattern, it can at least bring spiritual comfort to everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At critical moments, everyone hugs each other for warmth, and there is still a chance to remain neutral. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There is no doubt that the current situation is very unfavorable to Britain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After Spain's fall, the international situation that Britain will face may further deteriorate. 
    </font></font><br>
    <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The British government certainly wanted to win over the Spaniards if possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although Spain's strength is not very good, it is better to have one more ally from the great powers than one more enemy from the great powers. 
        </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Unfortunately, Britain and Spain are still on opposite sides for various reasons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible for the Spanish government to defect to the British government regardless of its own interests just for a vague promise from the British government. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Since win over cannot be achieved, the only option is to suppress. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        HRE has killed France, and now it is at its peak; Britain, which has not performed for a long time, now also needs to establish its authority and establish its own majesty as a hegemon. 
    </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Otherwise, all countries would be pulled away by the Vienna government, and Britain would really be alone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the moment the Continental Alliance was established, the British were destined to abandon "isolationism." 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        The miserable Spain has tragically become a victim of the great power game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise, it would just take the blame for someone else, and the British government would not catch Spain to its death. 
        </font></font><br>
          When one problem is not solved, a new one arises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If one bank can't do it, then you can only find cooperation with multiple banks. 
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        This is why the Spaniards suspected that the Vienna government was behind it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No matter which way you look at it, Shinra is the biggest beneficiary right now. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        It not only has sufficient strength, but also is the biggest beneficiary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who would believe me if I say it has nothing to do with the mastermind behind the scenes? 
     </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        If he wasn't sure that he didn't do it, Franz wouldn't believe it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Cuban independence movement has nothing to do with the HRE, but the increasingly unstable situation in Morocco makes it somewhat unworthy of its allies. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        As a moral emperor, Franz would naturally not stab his younger brother at this time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But just because the emperor has moral integrity does not mean that all his subordinates also have moral integrity. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        There are various signs that someone within the Holy Roman Empire is already eyeing the Spanish colonies. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Everyone knows that for the sake of international image, neither the wealthy Philippine Islands nor the Cuban HRE can be eaten. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The only place to start is in the Moroccan areas that have not yet been controlled by Spain. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although it is recognized by various governments as Spain's sphere of influence, the Kingdom of Morocco is indeed an independent country and not a Spanish colony. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        As the saying goes: "If you are not afraid of thieves stealing, you are afraid of thieves missing you." 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Now that the opportunity has come, naturally some people started making small moves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, these guys know how to take the impact into account and act appropriately. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        They just imported a batch of arms to Morocco and sold them to indigenous tribes who hated Spain, and they did it in the name of British arms dealers. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Franz felt a little relieved that he did not plan the so-called Moroccan independence movement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this may not be because of moral integrity. After all, the Kingdom of Morocco has always been independent and there is no need to do it again. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Everything was done without saying a word, without stirring up a single wave. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        Although he didn't do anything drastic, it still made Franz feel embarrassed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to make up for his inner guilt, he decided to wait until the Spaniards came... and then pay for the Moroccan area. 
     </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        ... 
      </font></font><br>
     <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
