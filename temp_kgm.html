<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Schwartz's recruitment work in the Hesse and Baden areas went incredibly smoothly. Several recruitment sites were surrounded by enthusiastic local youths.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When Marin received the news, he was also filled with emotions.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is hard to imagine the poverty of Germans in this era.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In this era when the yield of rye per mu is only over 100 kilograms, there is not enough food to eat.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And because the Black Death has not broken out on a large scale for a long time, the population has increased a lot.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If it is a noble or wealthy family, adding a few more people may not be a big deal.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But in a serf family, it would be a tragedy.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There was a limited number of people needed to cultivate the estate's land, and there were only a limited number of people to feed.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Serf owners were not philanthropists and would not benefit others at the expense of themselves.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, except for the eldest son of a serf family who needs to inherit his father's business and continue to be a serf for the serf owner, the other sons will be driven out by the manor owner to make a living for themselves when they grow up.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If they were near Hanseatic commercial cities or in areas with developed handicraft industries such as Saxony, these surplus laborers might be able to enter handicraft workshops and sell their labor to earn a living.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, in the inland mountainous areas such as Hesse and Baden, there is basically no handicraft industry, and the city's population capacity is also very limited.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, people here are really poor...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Schwartz was surrounded by a group of skinny young men at the recruiting points in Hesse and Baden.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It is obvious that most of these young people do not have enough to eat.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, Schwartz is here to recruit soldiers, not to do charity.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Since it is recruiting soldiers, it naturally needs to pass an assessment...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It's still Marin's old method - you don't need to be strong in martial arts, you just need to be brave enough and not afraid of pain during the assessment battle.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, mercenaries are a dangerous profession with their heads tied to their belts.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you are afraid of being injured or hurt by your opponent's wooden stick, how can you ensure that you have the courage to fight the enemy on the battlefield?
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, during the competition, in addition to being brave and fearless, if you can also have a calm mind, such a person will be specially marked on the list and will be trained as a squad leader in the future.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Soldiers at the bottom need to be brave and fearless, while those who serve as officers at the bottom need not only to be brave and fearless, but also need a calm heart.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Schwartz originally planned to recruit 9,000 infantry in the Hesse and Baden regions, but unexpectedly, he had already selected all the people, and the recruitment point was still surrounded by a large group of local youths, refusing to let him leave.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There was no other way, so Schwartz had to send people to work hard and send the news back to Aurich without hesitation.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After getting the news, Marin thought for a long time, and then gave a reply - continue to recruit 2,500 people, just to fill the vacancy left by Frunzberg who took away 2,500 people!
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for the 2,500 people Frunzberg took away, Marin did not plan to come back.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, he met the emperor and received his support.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Otherwise, he would not be able to secure his position as earl.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Frunzberg and the 2,500 soldiers were regarded as the representatives and assistants of the Marin faction to the emperor.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for this recruitment, Marin changed his plan and planned to recruit 2,500 more people.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In this way, Marin plans to replenish the number of troops in East Friesland to 10,000.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then, the Teutonic Kingdom also put 10,000 people there for training.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Once there are changes in Rome, these 10,000 people will quickly board the ship and accompany Archbishop Rovere back to Italy by sea.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, even if Schwartz recruited another 2,500 people, he could not stop the enthusiasm of the locals.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You know, Schwartz recruited a total of 11,500 people in the two princely states, but as many as 40,000 young people came to sign up...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although they know that being a mercenary is dangerous, these young people are afraid of poverty.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In order to have enough to eat every day, they are willing to risk their lives.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, the people who came were actually not just people from Hesse and Baden.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After hearing the news, poor young people from some nearby vassal states also came from all over the country on foot to sign up...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When Schwartz announced that he would stop hiring, many young people burst into tears.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Many people even shouted that instead of a salary of 3 pfennigs a day, as long as they have enough to eat every day...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It's no wonder that the weather in the inland areas of Germany has been abnormal this year, resulting in food harvest failure and famine in many places.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As it happened, the regions of Hesse and Baden were both within the scope of the famine.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     That's why so many people want to sign up as mercenaries.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Otherwise, you will starve to death if you stay at home.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It's better to be a mercenary and a dead ghost.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you are lucky, not only will you not die in battle, but you will also go home rich.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Once upon a time, several mercenaries from Hesse joined Marin's team in Italy.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After Marin sold the prisoners of war and horses privately, he distributed a lot of gold coins to each person.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After these people came back, they all built houses, bought land, married wives, and became little winners in life...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Inspired by this rumor, when young people in the Hesse area heard that Marin sent people to recruit soldiers, many people rushed to sign up.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, they don't know that the kind of good things that happened in Italy are very rare.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But everyone has a luck mentality, and they always imagine that they are the ones who are lucky.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, young people are very active.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, even if you don't get good things like dozens or hundreds of gold coins, you can definitely have enough food and clothing with a salary of 3 pfennigs a day, and you can even save half of the money to support your family.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     What's more, there is a famine in southern Germany this year. If you can survive, you are considered good. How can you dare to find fault?
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     While Schwartz sent people to bring the recruited recruits back to East Friesland in batches, he also sent an urgent message to Marin.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin originally planned to ignore it, but he suddenly remembered that his American colony seemed to need a large population.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     So, Marin changed his mind...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     He immediately wrote back, asking Schwartz to come back immediately and take the selected recruits to the Teutonic Kingdom.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But at the same time, Kohler was sent to these two places and brought a group of subordinates with him.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Kohler went here not to recruit soldiers, but to recruit immigrants...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Developing the American colonies required population and labor.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Since these young people are too poor to survive, why not recruit some to go to the American colonies to cultivate wasteland?
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Kohler not only brought many clerks and guards, but also many bakers who were good at making "cola bread" (that is, adding straw bran to bread).
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Obviously, Kohler wants to use the simple, direct and crude method of "enough bread tubes" to attract these hungry young people...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The operation of loading and transporting the new soldiers to the Teutonic Kingdom went smoothly. Marin not only used the 10 200-ton Kirk sailing ships originally purchased, but also hired a dozen idle merchant ships from the Hanseatic League to help transport the people.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin asked the fleet to transport 9,000 people to the Teutonic Kingdom, and left another 2,500 people to supplement the army of the East Frisian Count.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     His large-scale recruitment of troops once again aroused tensions among neighboring countries.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, Marin told the envoys from neighboring countries that these were mercenaries recruited for the Teutonic Kingdom.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Grand Captain Philip and Duke John II of Cleaver also came forward to help cover up the lie, which reassured several neighboring countries.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The recruitment of cavalry in the Teutonic Kingdom was also extremely smooth. Marin's uncle Yule personally came forward. Most of the wandering knights in the Teutonic Kingdom who were not selected by the Teutonic Knights,  u, chose Come and participate in the selection.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Yule clearly remembered Marin's recruitment requirements, and only recruited people with good moral character.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Yule would not admit any wandering knights who had committed crimes in the Teutonic Kingdom.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     You know, he is the secretary of the Grand Commander of the Teutonic State, and it is very easy to access the Teutonic State's public security files.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Who has committed a crime and who has been honest will be clear upon investigation.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, he only needs to choose among those wandering knights who have not committed any crime.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Moreover, due to financial constraints, many wandering knights are indeed unable to survive.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     There were even some wandering knights who went to the houses of small landowners in the countryside to serve as nursing homes in order not to go hungry.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin's salary for these wandering knights is 9 pfennigs a day, three times that of infantry.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     With such a salary, you will definitely not have to worry about food and drink, and the war horses can also have money to buy feed.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, these wandering knights signed up enthusiastically.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When Schwartz arrived in the Teutonic Kingdom with 9,000 infantry recruits, Jule had been waiting for a long time with the 1,000 cavalry he had picked...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     When the news that the recruitment was completed was returned to the Aurich Palace, Marin was drinking with his father-in-law, Archbishop Rovere...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Congratulations, kid. You have more than 20,000 troops. You are already the king of mercenaries in Germany. No other mercenary leader has as many troops as you, not even the Swiss! I am proud of you!" Rowe Archbishop Ray raised his glass filled with Bordeaux wine and congratulated him.
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Is he just the king of German mercenaries..." Marin smiled incredulously.
    </font>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As a time traveler and a mercenary leader, what is there to be proud of?
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     "My goal is the stars and the sea!" Marin added silently in his heart...
    </font>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
