   Chapter 1241 About Children's Education&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as Tios finished speaking, Dickpolis went on to say: "Although His Majesty and the Ministry of Commerce's approach is a bit harsh on our Thurii Chamber of Commerce, its fundamental purpose is to provide services to the Mediterranean. People from other countries show off their kingdom and show us Thurii, which promotes the prosperity of Thurii's business.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the long run, the prosperity and growth of Thurii's trade is more conducive to the development of our Thurii merchants, which is huge. It's a good thing. I think we should be happy and fully assist the Ministry of Commerce to run the business of this sports meeting!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sostatus looked at Dickpolis: Dickpolis took the initiative to speak for him, and actually made it clear to him Willing to restore friendship with him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The other people at the banquet were also thoughtful after listening to the words of Theos and Dickpolis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Saustatus laughed and said loudly: "Everyone, after we have finished talking about the business, let's not just sit there in a daze. Come on! Come on! Eat the food quickly. This is the dish that I urged the chef under me to carefully prepare. It's almost ready now." It's cold, don't waste it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The banquet in the backyard hall has just begun, and the banquet in the front yard living room is getting underway. Under the auspices of Steward Status, the place was already bustling with activity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heskraus was already a little flushed from drinking. Next to him, a Carthaginian businessman who was still a stranger was pulling him affectionately and talking non-stop: "You just said that you would bring your child to Thurii." Come on, how old is he?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nine years old."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems you are planning to let him go to school in Thurii, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "No, no, you are mistaken, I just brought the child to watch the sports meeting. Kingdom Schools have also been built in Larissa and Philae. I plan to send my son back to Thessaly to go to school next year."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I advise you." The Carthage businessman seemed not to have heard Hesklaus's response and burped from the wine. , continued: "It is best for the child to go to school in Thurii. This will be of great help to him in business or politics when he grows up. After all, your Thessaly has now been merged into Theonia. You are a citizen of Dioria, this is your luck..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heskraus was greatly moved after hearing this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, a head suddenly appeared from behind, which startled him. It turned out to be a businessman from Massilia (that is, Marseille) whom he had just met.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The businessman apparently heard the conversation between the two and asked curiously: "I heard that there are more than 10 Theonian schools in Turiyi?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course, you didn't see how many Theonian schools there are in Turiyi The population is said to have exceeded 400,000, which is several times the population of Carthage!" The Carthage businessman said with some sigh: "So one or two schools are not enough. I heard that now there is almost one school for every block... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Massilia businessman took over the conversation with some excitement: "I heard that the schools in the inner city of Turiyi are the best, and that the descendants of His Majesty the King, the children of senators, and the children of important ministers of the kingdom all study there. I heard that they are also open to the outside world. Recruit students. If our children can study in this school, it will definitely be of great help to their future development!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't have sweet dreams!" The Carthage businessman spit out the grape seeds on the table and sneered. A voice said: "There are children of the royal family and important ministers of the kingdom studying in the inner city school. How can it not be strictly guarded? It does recruit students from outside, but it only recruits two types of people. One is the children of soldiers who died in the Turiyi area. , the second is the children of the racial leaders and city-state leaders who are attached to the Kingdom of Theonia, like you and me, it is impossible for their children to enter that school...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, it doesn't matter if they can't enter the inner city schools, these schools in the outer city It's also very good. Some children of senators and kingdom officials also study there. My eldest son studied at the school in the eastern outer city not far from here -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These schools accept students like us who are not citizens of Theonia. Is the child going to school?" the Massilia businessman asked in surprise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course that's impossible, but there is another way -" the Carthage businessman showed a strange smile and pointed at the wine on the table: "After you finish three glasses, I will tell you." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Massilia businessman Without saying anything, he picked up the wine glass and drank three glasses in a row.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Massilia was the only Greek colonial city-state established within the sphere of influence of the Gauls. In addition to accepting invitations from Cumae and other Greek city-states in Campania in the early colonial period, Massilia jointly resisted the northward expansion of Carthage on the sea. Since then, it has not participated in any disputes between forces on the Italian peninsula and has been concentrating on development.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because it is close to the Tyrrhenian Sea, backed by the foothills of the Alps, and located at the mouth of the Rhone River. Next to it is another famous mountain pass connecting the Gaul region to Italy. The Massilians built tall and solid walls, allowing The Gauls, who were poorly armed, had nothing to do with them. On the contrary, Massilia took advantage of its convenient sea and land routes to develop itself into a famous port for trade with the Mediterranean in the Gaul region outside the mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although they were harassed by the Gauls from time to time, the Massilians, who benefited greatly from them, were content with their transcendent status. It was not until Theonia conquered Rome and became the overlord of Italy that Massilia adapted to the situation. Ally with Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To this day, the entire Western Mediterranean, even the former overlord Carthage, is attached to the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, not to mention some Theonia allies actively requesting to be merged into the kingdom, but Massilia still maintains its old alliance There is no change, and there are relatively frequent exchanges with Theonia in terms of trade, but politically they have always maintained a distance that is neither far nor close.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in fact, many Massilia businessmen became increasingly uneasy when they saw the increasingly powerful national power of the Kingdom of Theonia. They repeatedly proposed at the meeting that "we must establish closer diplomacy with the Holy Kingdom of Theonia." "Relationship", but this proposal was never passed at the citizens' assembly, because ordinary Massilia people are accustomed to this closed and isolated comfort and do not want this situation to change. Therefore, some Massilia businessmen can only find ways to make themselves The relationship between the family and the Kingdom of Theonia has become closer to ensure the security and development of the family, just like what this Massilia businessman did.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He slapped the empty wine glass on the dining table, and then said: "Three...three glasses have been finished, you...you can say it!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Carthage businessman's eyes were straightened when he saw it, how could he dare to show off any more, and quickly Said: "Uh... okay, let me say... this... Although there are laws in Theonia that only children of Theonia citizens can enter Theonia schools, there are still loopholes to take advantage of.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You should know that many of the citizens of Theonia are refugees from the Eastern Mediterranean. They wandered alone in Theonia, and finally became official citizens and settled down permanently. However, some of them have not yet settled down after getting married. The child died on the battlefield..." The Carthage businessman chuckled: "The adopted sons and daughters of Theonian citizens are legally binding. If you can get the widow of a citizen who died in battle to agree to recognize your child as an adopted son, and Go to the local household registration office to register, then your child will be able to enter school as a future Theonian citizen!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I think Lord Saustatus used this method to help my child enter the school in Turiyi..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh...that's it!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "After hearing this, the Massilia businessman's mind changed rapidly, thinking about how to ask Sostatus to help his children do the same.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This method will not work now!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "A thick voice came from behind the Carthage businessman.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hesklaus and the Malaylian businessman immediately said respectfully: "Lord Kaunus!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Carthaginian merchant turned around, he saw Saustatus' steward Kaunus standing behind him, and he quickly stood up to say hello.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kaunus was originally Kunogorata's confidant slave, and he obtained the title many years ago. He was freed and became a citizen of Theonia, but he was still willing to continue to serve Cunogorata, and later became the right-hand man of Sostatus, the huge commercial sales company established by Sostatus. The network was mainly implemented by him. Many downstream merchants dealt more with him than Sostatus. This is why he was able to host this banquet well and the merchants were willing to crowd around him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he looked at the Carthaginian businessman with a deep look, which made the Carthaginian shudder and realized that he had made a mistake.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kaunus quickly put on a smile and shouted to the people around him Said: "The method he said worked 10 years ago, but after reports from the tribunes of Thurii, the Senate issued a decree specifically on this, 'Unless one of the biological parents is a citizen of Theonia , he (she) can enjoy the rights enjoyed by minor citizens of the kingdom only if he (she) is adopted by other Theonian citizens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   'So today, the children of foreigners who are adopted by Theonian citizens still cannot enter Theonian schools!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kaunus looked at the depressed Massilia businessman and said seriously: "There are other ways for your children to study in schools within the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example, in towns with small populations such as Capusa and Garaguso, the kingdom has also built schools in these towns and sent teachers. Since there are few students, it is actually a bit wasteful. If you go to the Academic Affairs Department in Thurii Go apply, be willing to pay the high admission fees, and let your children study in schools in these towns. There is no problem at all.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But...what's the point of letting children study in these remote places?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Massilia businessman seemed a little disappointed with this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "First of all, in the current kingdom, even the teachers who teach in schools in remote towns all graduated from Theonia schools or even academies, and all passed the examination of the Ministry of Education, and After more than a year of professional training, only after obtaining the teaching qualification can you serve as a school teacher, and your teaching ability is guaranteed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
