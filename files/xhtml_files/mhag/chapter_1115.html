   Chapter 1115 Hasdrubal&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, sir."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Maximus!" A middle-aged man in white robes came towards this side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Copanis." After Maximus saw the person clearly, a smile immediately appeared on his face: "We just finished a battle yesterday. You are not treating the injured soldiers in the medical camp. You come here to hang out. You are not afraid of being hurt. Mr. Drogba's criticism."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There were not many wounded in yesterday's battle, and the injuries were not serious. They only needed one doctor and two nurses to handle them, and there was no need for me to treat them personally. In the medical camp I feel bored after staying here for a long time, so I came out today to get some fresh air and take care of the soldiers who were training. The commander of the Hasdrubal Army saw it and praised me for being very responsible." Copanis said with some satisfaction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the current requirements of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the director of the Legion Medical Battalion must be a doctor who has graduated from the Theonia Academy Medical School, has been practicing medicine for more than ten years, and has rich experience in emergency treatment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, since the Border Legion has been staying on the northern border of Etruria for a long time, it is always in danger. Unlike the regular legion, as long as the war is over and the medical staff can go home, they will basically not be called for military training. Therefore, these senior doctors from Theonia, who have already started a family and have a comfortable life, are basically unwilling to serve as directors of the Border Corps Medical Battalion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the Ministry of Military Affairs had to lower the terms of office for the director of the Border Corps Medical Battalion, and prepared to adopt a half-year rotation. Not many doctors signed up just like this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kopanis has only been practicing medicine for 5 years after graduating from the academy and is less than 30 years old. The reason why he was selected by the Ministry of Military Affairs is that in addition to his relatively good medical skills, his willingness to serve in the Border Corps for a long time is an important reason. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because he is young, he occasionally does some outrageous things, but because he has led the medical staff to do a lot of things over the past year or so, everyone is tolerant of this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus smiled and said nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Copanis suppressed his smile and said seriously: "Yesterday, I received news from Pisay. In a few days, Rome will deliver a batch of herbs, bandages... and other medical supplies. I need a pack team to arrive. Pick it up at Pisay Port."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A Theonian legion generally has a relatively large pack team, which has 300-500 laborers, 150-200 pack animals such as oxen, horses, and donkeys, and 80 pack cars. -150 liang.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It seems that there are a lot of materials, but every time the legion marches, the baggage camp, engineering camp, and medical camp have a large amount of materials that need to be transported. In fact, the transportation capacity is relatively tight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the baggage battalion accounts for the majority of transportation and has many transportation tasks, and the baggage baggage officer has more management skills than the medical director and engineering director, in order to facilitate management and command, before the Western Mediterranean War, the Ministry of Military Affairs had already stipulated: Legion packs The team is assigned to the baggage camp and is managed by the baggage officer. If there are transportation needs for the engineering battalion and the medical battalion, the baggage officer must make arrangements for them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Maximus asked directly: "How many medical supplies are there?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "About a ton... Well, maybe two tons..." Copanis stammered: "You know, the medical camp is here to stay For more than a year, its supplies have been replenished only once, but there are often wounded soldiers... Now the herbs and bandages are almost used up-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   How many supplies are there! I can't remember, but I can give a rough number. Maximus said angrily. After spending a year with this young man, he knew that this guy was not sensitive to numbers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now Copanis spoke fluently: "I heard that two cargo ships are coming."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maxim thought for a moment and then said: "I will send you thirty pack trucks, but for safety, I have to ask Harbin Man Sdruba applied for a company as a guard."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What are you applying to me for?" At some point, Hasdrubal came to them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus and Kopanis immediately explained the situation to Hasdrubal.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hasdrubal nodded in agreement, and then asked: "Maximus, have the rations promised to us by the Etruscans been shipped every year?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus immediately explained the situation to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hasdrubal immediately frowned: "This is not possible. You must urge them harder and ask them to transport all the food as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Lord Commander of the Legion!" Maximus responded loudly, then slightly He asked softly and suspiciously: "Is there something going on?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hasdrubal hesitated for a moment, and finally decided to tell his guess to make them wary: "Autumn is the harvest season, and it is also the time when the indigenous people go crazy. During looting. According to the reports of the Etrururians, the Gauls were most rampant at this time in the past, but so far this year, the Gauls' invasion has decreased, which seems a bit abnormal.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These days, the mountain reconnaissance team The soldiers came back and reported that the Gaulish tribes in the mountains to the north and adjacent to us had suddenly moved north. They wanted to go deeper to the north for reconnaissance, but the Gauls strengthened their vigilance there and increased their manpower, resulting in several casualties. The scout soldiers did not get any more information, but the situation is so abnormal, I'm afraid it is not a good thing. We must be more vigilant and prepare for defense!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hasdrubal chatted with his two subordinates for a while. After saying a few words, he ran to the heavy infantry and led the soldiers in training.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Master Hasdrubal is overthinking it. Maybe it's because our presence made the Gauls feel that the cost of looting here is too high, so they changed places." Copanis said disapprovingly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus glanced at him and said seriously: "If this is the case, the Gauls will not be the most terrifying enemies in the eyes of all races in northern Italy. Go and transport your supplies back quickly, maybe next time We will be busy..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a Roman who had personally experienced the Gauls conquering his motherland, Maximus knew the terror of the Gauls, although he expected Hasdrubal's intuition to be wrong. But reason told him that he could never be too wary of the Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was almost dusk before Hasdrubal gathered his troops and returned to the military camp under the afterglow of the setting sun.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The first thing the soldiers did when they returned to the military camp was not to have dinner, but to go to the bathroom to take a shower.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the engineers selected the site for the Border Corps military camp, they specifically chose it next to a river. During the construction, they also buried ceramic water pipes between the military camp and the river, so that the river water could be diverted directly into the military camp, and some of it could be used for drinking. Part of it is used for bathing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The regiment commander's residence is located next to the central headquarters of the military camp. It is larger in area and has its own dedicated kitchen, dining room, master bedroom, second bedroom, slave quarters, stables, and a small private bathroom... It can be said that it is relatively large. The main reason for luxury is that the Ministry of Military Affairs allows the family members of the legion commander to accompany the army, which will inevitably lead to some slaves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in fact, Hasdrubal stayed here for more than a year and never let his wife and children come to live in the military camp for a period of time. Therefore, there were only two slaves to take care of his daily life, and even meals were mostly shared in the group. Dining room.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to prevent the mansion from going to waste, he also allowed his adjutant and several senior officers to live in it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From time to time, he would go hunting in the mountains. If he caught a lot of prey, he would hold a small banquet in the mansion and invite the subordinates of the legion and the middle and senior team officers to attend.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But today, there were only two people in the dining room of the mansion-Hasdrubal and his lieutenant Kisgo.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though Kisgo is a member of the Magonid family, he once led an army of tens of thousands of people to fight alone. However, it is not an easy task to become the adjutant of the Theonian Legion, because according to military law: Legion The adjutant is a mid-level officer. He must have more than 5 years of service experience, participated in at least one war, served as a squad leader, a squad leader, or even a company captain, and then studied in the Staff Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs for one year before he can be appointed as a corps adjutant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was only because of Hasdrubal's persistence and Davos' special approval that Kisgo went through several months of special training and became the adjutant of the Etrunian Border Legion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Hasdrubal was reading the letter. He raised his head in shock: "Carthage and Theonia have formed an alliance?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It is not an equal alliance, but Carthage is dominated by Theonia! "Kisgo reminded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ah?!" Hasdrubal was stunned, and then his face became a little more angry: "I heard Haka talk about this in Turii last year. After Okriton returned, the Carthage Senate has not In response, I thought they had become tougher this time, but I didn't expect... I didn't expect them to be weaker than before! It's a disgrace to us Carthage people!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I heard Dido say that the reason why Carthage was so weak this time You will agree, because the 17th Army Corps sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs (the military camp was in Lilibi, and the troops came from the western region of Sicily) easily wiped out the rebellious Masili tribe, demoted all the captives of the tribe into slaves, and also The land was distributed to other tribes in West Numbia... The Carthage Senate must have been frightened, fearing that it would become the second Masili, so it took the initiative to ask for an alliance with Theonia -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Be greedy and fearful. Death!" Hasdrubal snorted coldly, suddenly remembered something, and asked: "How did Carthage deal with people like Hanno and Typanlaco?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to our requirements, they were Expelled from the city of Carthage!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Just expelling is too cheap for these damn guys!" Hasdrubal was not satisfied with this, and he immediately asked: "How did Dido react when he heard the news? ?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, in southern Iberia, Hasdrubal was busy fighting for a day, and he did not see Dido for many years. Although the two were cousins, they were not close until he led the legion to station in It. After the northern border of Luria, I got very close to Dido who lived in Rome. Because they were both in a foreign country, family ties became valuable, so the two of them had more contacts (mainly with Dido providing help and support). People's relationships are quickly improved.&#13;
