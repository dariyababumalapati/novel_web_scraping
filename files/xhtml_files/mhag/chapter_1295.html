   Chapter 1295: The Great Battle of Cyprus (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The sailors quickly withdrew their wooden oars inward, and the opponent's warships were also trained to withdraw their oars in time. The two warships almost passed each other, and even the Cypriot sailors looked through The sailors of the enemy ship can be clearly seen through the narrow hatch. Their expressions are cold and confident, and many of them even have a mocking smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Death is imminent, what is there to be proud of!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...the Cypriot sailors thought angrily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With a "Bang!" sound, the 12-meter-long suspension bridge crashed down and was nailed to the deck of the Cyprus warship. The forward Cyprus warship suddenly had a heavy burden, and it soon stopped. Forty The Theonian fleet infantry quickly passed the drawbridge and killed the enemy ship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, another parallel Cypriot warship in the double-column formation had turned a small corner and rushed towards the hull of the Crow warship, which could no longer move.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing this dangerous situation, the Theonian sailors remained calm. Under the command of the captain, facing the imminent collision, they used the fixed suspension bridge as the fulcrum to try their best to deflect the entire warship slightly. , so that the ship body is not vertically facing the collision angle of the enemy ship, but has a certain deflection angle. It seems that this effort seems to be in vain, because based on past experience, this level of violent collision can still make the battle The ship suffered a lot of damage, but -&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Peng!" After a loud noise, the three warships were shaking violently at the same time. However, the Cypriot crew on the deck widened their eyes in surprise: Dioni The part where the Yawu warship was hit by their warship was only sunken inward into a small crater, and was not broken into a large gap.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turns out that this crow warship is an iron ship!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Over the years, through full cooperation between Theonia Academy, Thurii Shipyard, and Ironworks Workshop, repeated experiments have been carried out, and the weak hull of the crow warship was hooped with a special iron sheet, which not only made the warship more resistant to The collision ability is greatly enhanced, and at the same time, the warship's ability to float and balance on the sea is retained, but the sailing speed is slower.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the entire warship was painted black, people who did not know the inside story did not know the specialness of this kind of warship. Therefore, the Cypriot crew felt very happy when they saw that the Theonia ship was safe and sound under such a violent impact. be surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonia crew breathed a sigh of relief. Although the iron ship had been tested many times during normal training, this was the first time it was used in actual combat, and it obviously did not live up to their expectations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the fast warship hiding behind the iron ship rushed up like a ghost and quickly hit the enemy ship that was still crowded with the crow warship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Cypriot crew, who had no time to dodge, could only hope for a miracle like the Crow Warship just now, but no... water poured into the bottom tank through the broken gap...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the fleet infantry rushed to another Cyprus After the warship, they did not rush into the cabin, but killed the crew and helmsman on the deck, completely destroyed the rudder, and then quickly returned to the Crow Warship and pulled out the drawbridge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Cypriot warship that lost its rudder completely lost its ability to flexibly turn and became a target for enemy ships. The best way to avoid being sunk was to withdraw from the battlefield.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Yalitaka led the main force of the Persian fleet to the vicinity of the battlefield, he was surprised to find that Cypriot warships were gathering together, waiting for his arrival.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon he knew the reason: the Theonian fleet in the bay not only had strong warships, but also had unique tactics and strong defensive capabilities. The Cyprus fleet, which had slightly more warships than its opponent, not only failed to gain the upper hand in the attack, but also After destroying more than a dozen warships, no great results were achieved. The morale of the crew was hit and they had to retreat temporarily to wait for reinforcements.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the combat effectiveness of this Theonian fleet is surprising, Yalitaka, as the commander of the Persian fleet, was secretly happy that the Cypriots who did not obey orders suffered a small setback. He believed that this was just a way to improve his performance in Great opportunity for prestige in the fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to the battle process of the Cypriots in detail, he still decided to adopt a double-column offensive formation, but he gave up the Cypriots' tactic of focusing on one side of the attack. Instead, he took advantage of the huge advantage of having more than twice the number of warships as the opponent's to attack in all directions. Launch an attack to overwhelm the Theonia fleet's defense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers of the Theonian Legion high up on the beach saw countless Persian warships spread out on the sea in the distance like a huge fishing net, and they posed menacingly like they were about to shrink the group into a ball. The Onia fleet was completely trapped, which made everyone worry about the safety of the fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian, who was at the center of the storm, laughed calmly: "The Persian fleet has finally come forward, great! These timid Persian servants will soon know how powerful the Theonian fleet is. ! Woo!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "... Woo!... Woo!..." Accompanied by the loud sound of the bugle, three red flags were raised on the main mast of the Theonia flagship and fluttered in mid-air.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fight to the death!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Every crew member who received the captain's message looked at the surging enemy ships ahead, and began to hum the Hades hymn in a low voice with a calm expression&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the thick fog on the sea dissipated and the sky became brighter, Midorades immediately realized that something was wrong. Although he could not know the specific location of the fleet, it should have appeared. The Chaoyang, which was diagonally to the right of the fleet, appeared diagonally to the rear. It had obviously deviated greatly from the course.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He finally gathered the warships and cargo ships scattered nearby, then sent out clippers to search in the direction of the sun, and at the same time let the entire fleet sail in the direction of the sun.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the voyage, he gathered some scattered warships and troop transports, and the fleet he led gradually possessed the 1st Squadron, 2nd Squadron, 5th Squadron, and part of the 4th Squadron of the Second Fleet. Ships, as well as the Third Squadron, the 4th Squadron, the 5th Squadron, and some of the 6th Squadron warships of the First Fleet, a total of more than 700 ships, in addition to nearly 400 troop carriers... Such a huge In a mixed fleet, Midorades also widened the distance between the ships, doubling the area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the entire ship array and expanding outward. It was his move that finally caused the clippers sent by Sekerian to Found them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few hours later, Midorades led the fleet to the bay where the Theonian army landed, and saw countless Persian warships charging and maneuvering around the offshore area, like covering the sky. The vultures on the sun are sharing their delicacies, and the Theonian warship is almost invisible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Midorades was anxious, he did not act impulsively and immediately launched an attack. He kept the troop fleet away temporarily and asked all the warships to fan out in front of the Persian fleet as they marched. Then, with fast warships in front, The crow warship followed in the "starry sky" formation and launched a charge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The flagship of Yalitaka has been coordinating and directing the battle from the rear. After a hard battle, the Persian fleet finally broke through the defense of the Theonian fleet, disrupted its formation, and was preparing to completely crush it in one go. At that time, he received an emergency notification from the Clippers: a larger Theonian fleet was approaching rapidly!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This news immediately extinguished Yalitaka's enthusiasm for victory and glory. He was so frightened that his only idea at this time was to have the fleet retreat immediately, but the warships that were already scattered in the vast offshore sea and were in battle It was impossible to receive his orders quickly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the newly arrived Theonian fleet was like a giant eagle with open wings amidst the loud sound of the bugle, rushing towards its prey quickly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long and hard battle, the Persian fleet's warships were damaged, its sailors were tired, its strength was dispersed, and it was out of formation; while the Theonian fleet led by Midorades, although its crew was relatively tired after a long journey, saved its comrades and defeated the enemy. Their faith gave them strong morale, and the always-invincible starry sky formation doubled their strength.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the Persian fleet was almost defeated at first touch and fled in all directions. The Theonian warships took advantage of the victory to pursue them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's even more unfortunate is that during the process of escaping south, the Persian fleet encountered the Theonian Third Fleet, which was escorting the baggage fleet. As a result, it suffered even more heavy losses under the attack from both front and rear&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Medorades jumped off the ship, swabbed the water, and walked onto the beach.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the beach was full of Theonian soldiers who had landed. Under the command of the team officer, they gathered one team at a time and began to march towards the camp being built by the Theonian soldiers who had landed before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Midorades' destination was the same as theirs. Because of his conspicuous commander-style helmet, soldiers who knew or did not know him all bowed respectfully to him when they met him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Normally, he would greet them with a smile, but now he was anxious and quickly walked into the temporary medical camp tent as if he hadn't seen him before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No one saluted him here, the doctors and nurses were busy rescuing the wounded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian Legion soldiers who landed did not fight with the Cypriots. These wounded were all from the Theonian fleet that had just ended the battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Midorades stopped a soldier who was helping to clean up the dirt and asked in a deep voice: "Where is Secorion?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldier glanced at him, pointed forward hurriedly, and said: "In...in the innermost part ."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is said to be the innermost, but it is actually on the other side of the tent. This kind of tent dedicated to medical camps is equipped with multiple tents to ensure the circulation of air, convenience during rescue and the recovery of patients. Sekerian's The hospital bed was next to a tent. The tent had a small opening, and the sunlight came in and hit Sekerian's body. With this light, two nurses were carefully cleaning his wounds.&#13;
